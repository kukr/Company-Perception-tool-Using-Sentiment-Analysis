Netflix|" High Performance Culture to Challenge You Netflix asks for a lot from its employees. They pay well, but it's not uncommon for your family to feel like they're the second priority. You are asked to show up fully and with vulnerability (aka seek feedback and give feedback), but the risk is you're then judged. There is not a lot of sincere compassion or curiosity from leadership for the employee experience. The sentiment is""love it or leave it"" and ""it's not for everybody."" That lack of empathy plays out even more harshly if an employee is from a historically excluded community. High compensation, great opportunity to grow your resume, super smart colleagues to learn from Company has become too big to care about employee experience 1 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Company managers and supervisor treats everyone equally. As an assemler yeah they are the nicest boss ive ever had. Company is fair in salary and holidays gift surprises from the company.

Job is the same everyday sometimes everybody gets more work time. That is if you want more time . 1 star What is the best part of working at the company?

Some team members came in in their pjs or looked homeless. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Long and stressful 1 Yes Do it, you wont regret it. Fun work culture.

People are nice and friendly, very international. Growing inside the company might be challenging. 3 Nice place to work A typical day is pretty exhausting. I learned that it’s a good company to work at, management is pretty strict and peers great to work with. Very demanding 2 Community Great place to work! Close knit family like environment! They take care of their employees and communicate effectively. It was my favorite job that I love ever had! 1 Pretty good employer! Good work life balance, understanding managers, strong culture. Bennefits package is good too. People are nice and friendly, very international. Growing inside the company might be challenging. People, great product, culture. A lot of work, no growth Feedback Culture Great place that pushes you beyond your everyday duties. You will be expected to be involved in outside projects that benefit the greater team. You will be expected to give and receive criticism from your peers as a way to improve your processes and work flows. Pay, Benefits, Wfh None except being laid off 1 Best place to work I loved it here, the break/lunch room was so amazing i still dream about it, the environment is super cool and the way the supervisors make each team super unique is amazing. sunday funday meetings with supervisors, play trivia games during meetings, desk competition for holidays schedules were a bit annoying Great Learn a lot, get payed a lot. Super fun. Young people. Good benefits. Decent Management. Its a fun company to work for. No opportunity to innovative in all roles. Job security.. 1 Netflix is a company who give me a support to learn everything in Netflix. They were really friendly and helpful. Netflix is extremely good Netflix is a world wide company. They are friendly and kind they have good customer base. I can manage my time because Netflix give us good and time managing tasks . I have completed my task at time. Netflix paid my salaries at time. If I have a chance to work on Netflix again. It will be a great opportunity to me because Netflix is really kind and friendly they helped us. Netflix is extremely good. I'm happy with Netflix. Sometimes good sometimes bad Always had contests to make the work environment a great place to work. I do not know if the stressful calls without much help for management is worth sticking around for the contests. Seems like there is always a shift bid going on and the available shifts change dramatically within each 3 month period. This makes it hard for people with kids. You may get a 6am to 2pm shift one time and then company will get rid of that shift all together and depending on where you are in seniority or stats yuh could end up with a 4pm to midnight shift. You just never know. Horrible Management Even with 9+ years of experience in my field, I was micromanaged to death! Disgusting lack of trust and inherent fear amongst teammates. Abysmal leadership. I was also thrown onto multiple projects on my third week without any guidance. Company benefits and pay were amazing, though. Super top notch stuff! 3 great place to work Its a great place to work really loved the people and the culture and the job. In CS its very unique they don't have typical ways of dealing with customers and its great. great its a job 2 They will lay you off for India reps Great place for good pay and benefits. Not difficult to do job at all. The did have alot of flexible attendance options to avoid tardiness and swap days. 2 1 Productive, Inclusive, accommodating, and overall stable workplace. When Netflix shut down it's call center my heart broke. I finally felt like I had found a stable job with reasonable pay and benefits that I could work at forever and work my way up. I felt such pride working for this company and that was a huge deal for me. I wanted to work somewhere brag worthy, and that call center was it. I loved literally everyone I worked with. I'm not sure I'll ever feel as satisfied working any other job and I wish daily they didn't outsource all their call centers and shut us down. It's been years and I still miss that job. 1 Funplace It was really good and easy going job but then the campaign was sold and they had to let us go but it was one of the best jobs I have ever had and I will love to be back Free lunches Short break 1 Just terrible My 3 years there were the 3 worst years of my working life. It was an awful experience working with a company bloated with too many inept managers. I was ultimately let go for reading a gardening book at my desk between calls, a rule that was never written down and none of my colleagues had heard spoken. They were a bunch of no talent clowns. 3 Productive and fun place to work at, they are very respectful and everyone gets along, no drama. Excellent work ethics, my favorite job of my life! Everything at Netflix is wonderful. Great!! I love it there. Change is good and I'm only part time now so I'm looking for a full time job and it I have been there for 7 years, it is time to explore other options. 1 Tense and stressful workplace Judging by the questions, I’m assuming this doesn’t have to do with working on set for Netflix. All I can say is, out of the couple times I ended up working for Netflix, specifically the last time: the management was the worst out of any job I’ve ever worked. The policies were absolutely ludicrous to the point where changes had to be made urgently in the middle of the project. I wouldn’t care if they knew who wrote this. Guaranteed long work Short breaks, no breaks, awful bosses, disrespect is a norm. 1 High Performance Culture to Challenge You Netflix asks for a lot from its employees.

That lack of empathy plays out even more harshly if an employee is from a historically excluded community. High compensation, great opportunity to grow your resume, super smart colleagues to learn from Company has become too big to care about employee experience 1 Dream job while you're useful Disclaimer: I was laid off as part of a reorganization (1 of 10), but I would have written the same review had I been the one who was spared. In the 5+ years that I worked at NF, 4 first years were awesome. I often felt elated, I loved going to work both physically and then virtually due to COVID. Mature, caring colleagues, interesting work, lots of learning, wonderful connections. I joined when my team was in the startup phase, and it was the best time for ideas and trying new things with no budget limitations. Gradually, over the course of the following 5 years, the need to scale led to constant changes, both of leadership and workflows. Team leaders were being ""let go"" on average every 1.5 years if not sooner. There was barely enough time to become good at what one does as yet another big reorg/title change would come around. Lastly, the team came under the leadership of people who had absolutely no knowledge of the team's specialty, but were ""experts"" in strategizing and optimizing processes. Eventually it shifted from being people-driven to process-driven, from collegial to top-down. The bottom line started winning over quality while business needs outweighed everything else. Pros: Awesome colleagues Productive work environment Top of market pay, nice perks Lots of learning opportunities through constant change Cons: Low job security Process driven vs people driven Constant change High level of ambiguity 2 Great employer. Nice pay. Cool culture. Genuine. Long hours. Great people. No drama. The people were really nice and the company did not really spare any expense to strive to make a movie of a high caliber. Generally a decent place but turnover is high and work appreciation is low I initially enjoyed working here but I noticed that sometimes you’re not appreciated for the work that you do well and, instead, you’re criticized for what you may not do well. Scheduling and calendar management are major for assistants but they’ll also throw project work on you which is what a coordinator should be doing - not an admin. The over emphasis on DEI is maddening Their entire company is modeled around 1 percent of the population Job security is zero. Once your contract is up you need to re-apply to work on another project. Constant emphasis on inclusion and diversity makes it feel like that is the only reason the company exist. And if you don’t agree, of course, you are not included. Best swag ever No job security. Sounds great from the outside, totally different on the inside Be ready to be worked into the dirt. There's no such thing as a work-life balance here. Managers protect each other and act counter to the company culture, then gaslight you by saying you're misinterpreting the culture. Politics is the only way to get ahead and be ready to be passed up for promotions or more responsibilities by those who play the game better, even if their work is terrible. Lunches and snacks, nice name to put on your resume, good pay. Mental Health will nosedive, rest of your life will suffer. Yoga balls are slippery and we need more catered food with fruits and vegetables, imported and poached correctly. I really liked working with everyone in a diverse work setting. I like family settings, food, and structurally sound sets built locally. I review this job is amazing because I live locally. My family lived in the South Shore and my Fiancée lived nearby and I never snuck away to visit for holidays due to quarantine and FMLA, mainly the CDC. Catering is healthy, super healthy and everywhere. Smoking, judgement Good, but not great. When I worked here, I was very happy! The pay was satisfying, and there were little to no cons! However, as I started overachieving at work, I never got a raise! That is why I'm giving it a 4 and not a 5. Best company This was one of if not the best company I’ve worked for. The culture the people just the overall vibe was awesome. I definitely would recommend working here. Good income Really good pay. Pretty easy but incoming calls can be nonstop at certain times. Down time is fun because you can play group games or mess around with different consoles Money Back to back calls One of the Best Places to work Happy kind positive amazing place to work. I was able to come to work and find out what my skills were and I will always be appreciative of Netflix for that! Thank you for helping me realize a workplace can be and should be better!! You are amazing I’m sad you left Salt Lake! 😔 bueno muy bueno el ambiente laboral con los compañeros y ayuda Good but bad They offered a high salary. The working environment was good, however there was a culture of fear which everyone was talking about. Seeing my mates getting fired often, I found out I'm working in a place where my space was not secured. Basic Call Center Not a great place to work. Expectations were high, morale was low. Nearly unreachable goals and management was just the guy who sat next to you who had the best call times. Best place I have ever worked The DVD.com hub I worked at was wonderful, very few employees, very laid-back atmosphere, but highly efficient and productive, encouraging self-motivation. If you wanted to learn more positions, you could, if you were content with the same tasks then you could didn't have to learn new ones. They paid very well for the work, offered paid time off, retirement and really great monthly gifts even for part time employees! The work itself is fairly monotonous, usually just loading and unloading DVD's and troubleshooting jams in the machinery, but what warehouse isn't monotonous. The flexibility to learn more positions allows a person to take on the level of challenge they are feeling up to that day. Pay, benefits, culture Not the best working environment Environment was unprofessional. They didn’t pay well. Training was decent. Room for growth to becoming a leader or tier 2 representative. Contract eventually expired. High salary, no growth, selfish management. You’ll never be paid more for a job as they pay top of market and definitely mean it. There’s a heavy amount of nepotism and friend hook ups happening at the company. If you have a disagreement or run in with a manager your chances of survival are nearly none. Netflix is the Las Vegas of jobs, gambling high risk high reward against a potential huge let down should you get on someone’s bad side. There’s virtually no growth in the company anymore as things are too corporate. Don’t believe the legends of people starting out as assistants and becoming Vice Presidents. That doesn’t happen there anymore, it’s become just another top heavy corporation. Great salary, little future, zero security. Salary, Healthcare, Stock Zero work/life balance, terrible middle management, no growth opportunities Culture It is unlike any place that i have worked. It is challenging work, but rewarded with a generous (top of market) salary, and an unparallelled benefits package. Usually with full health, 401k and stock options. Netflix Rules I had the best time working at Netflix. Although my position was short lived because I had other jobs, I saw room for growth within the company and I the teams. It was great being able to get a account with Netflix and seeing all the programs coming out. Helping customers is a plus!! Great job for the pay too! $15 and up!! Free food on special days, games, fun teamwork Short bathroom and lunch breaks. Company had a bad system All Netflix cared about was getting the customer off the phone in 7 minutes or less. All they wanted you to do was send them the emails in the support page and hang up. If your average call time was above seven minutes you had to go into coaching. The more calls the more money and less helping people. Job tookcl years off my life from the stress of working 5 to 2am. None really Everything Had better Had better jobs. Laid off due to pandemic. Worked me 5 days a week even being part time. Volume dropped tremendously. People standing around doing nothing while being paid.

That lack of empathy plays out even more harshly if an employee is from a historically excluded community. High compensation, great opportunity to grow your resume, super smart colleagues to learn from Company has become too big to care about employee experience 1 The support from management Netflix was an amazing place ro work. We received several bonuses and rewards for or work and we treated with respect. We also got devices and we were open to promotion opportunities. Free transportation Short breaks Pretty Good They offer a great place to work. Excellent culture and the office space is incredible. Helpful team always answering my questions, never feeling left out. Free lunch None Multicultural place that embraces collaboration Great culture. Sometimes too many meetings but they're trying to decrease those in general. Personal time is prioritized if needed but work can bleed into evenings occasionally. Wholesale Department It was fun. Very fast paced! Got to meet a lot of people from all walks of life. Worked from 2am to 11am plus some OT some days. Wish our department never closed/moved to another state! Otherwise, I’d still be working there. Free breakfast… Sodas, Candy Our department moved to another state! Monotonous It's just a typical call center. Calls come in one after another and it's usually the same conversations over and over. The pay was great for an entry level job and the benefits were nice too, but don't expect to learn much with limited growth opportunities. Benefits Boring Great place to work! This place was so fun to work for. Great atmosphere and my job was really fun. I would definitely recommend applying. They are very competitive and make sure that they hire only the best. Free food, great PTO, free Netflix! Great personal time off Very competitive. Amazing place to work! Had a fun time, great work environment, fantastic people! Everyone gets along, and the staff are all fun and excited to be there. Fantastic food every day as well! Free food, great staff, incredible work environment Difficult to get work Great company When I worked there I enjoyed the csr role that I had. I felt like they had decent leadership as well. I would recommend working there to one of my colleagues Inclusivity Restructured I specifically left a good job w/ managers I actually trusted, to come work for Netflix because of the culture they advertised. I eventually learned the culture did not apply to me, as explained by HR. The HR Business Partner was completely ineffective & only went out of their way conceal concerns I had. Once I began to speak up, I was retaliated against. The culture is lip service and is not practiced in the work environment. If it is, exceptions have been made and the culture does not apply to everyone. There is most definitely a ""culture of fear"" & I unfortunately witnessed it firsthand. These were some of the slimiest managers & producers I've ever had the displeasure of working with, they possess the morals of guinea pigs. There was also tampering with my payroll information & incorrect information purposely placed in my records. There is a culture that is advertised & shared That culture is no longer in place & does not apply to everyone Horrible management team. Great people can be found however the toxic environment usually pushes the good ones away fast. I have never written one of these but run away from this place...don't walk. Promises are frequent but management is brutal. I have been in management for 20 years and never seen anything this bad. Free mac and cheese Environment, culture, management Fun place to work, typical customer service job. Management changes up every six months, they coached us every week. But the customers were usually pretty nice. You'd get the usual entitled customer who'd be very demanding as to why their netflix didn't work. But what do you expect. Swag, cool break room No room for growth Excellent leadership The leadership there is incredible and they want you to succeed. The job itself is really simple but does require a lot of patience. There's room to grow and your supervisors will help you to succeed. You get weekly meetings to help you achieve your goals. Management pay teamwork Health insurance isnt great Great management, great perks, wonderful co workers Just and overall great company to work for, great management and special events for employees. Free lunches and snacks, free coffee, tea and soft drinks. Best job I ever had Free lunches and more Stressful customers -Amazing culture, great people, fun place to work at Netflix cs was one of my best jobs I’ve ever had. Awesome culture and the people there are amazing. Pay was good and the job itself wasn’t bad. Overall it was a fun place to work at. Benefits, people, management, swag, room for advancement When Netflix cs sold out to another company, not enough between time Great pay, cutthroat environment Great pay, no job security. People don’t like to share job duties in an effort to protect their own jobs. Way too much time wasted in endless meetings. great place to work - Work and culture is good - Interesting work - Benefits are good - Inclusive - If you can learn on your own and confident on skill sets, it is great place to work - No IC growth Unreasonable I have never worked for a company that showed so little care about its employees. I had to deal with 2 trainers neither knowing how to do the job they are training you for. Most questions are always ignored as your told to look it up. Often times if you struggle or need any explanation during training you will get ignored completely. Half the time you are working if you need a supervisor or lead to assist in a case you'll end up waiting 20 minutes just to get a response. They fired me because I left work halfway through the day after clearly showing I was too ill to perform my duties that day. Because half a day is more important than my health. never work for this company they do not care about you and will drop you like a fly the moment you aren't a top performing model employee with near perfect health and immunity to all disease. El ambiente de trabajo El trabajo parece fácil , pero llega hacer monótono todo s los dias laborales son exactamente iguales, llega hacer muy monótono. Buen seguro médico, vacaciones, sueldo Días de 4 horas laborales contra otros de hasta 12 horas Productive fun work place enviorment I love my job here its so much fun and everyone is so nice and talented everyone helps out amd communicates very well. Over all i love my job.There are lovely people to work with all the time. The worst company culture I’ve ever experienced If you have any anxiety or need for accommodation, do not work here. Managers only care about their numbers and they will fire you without chance of improvement High Performance Culture to Challenge You Netflix asks for a lot from its employees. They pay well, but it's not uncommon for your family to feel like they're the second priority. You are asked to show up fully and with vulnerability (aka seek feedback and give feedback), but the risk is you're then judged.

That lack of empathy plays out even more harshly if an employee is from a historically excluded community. High compensation, great opportunity to grow your resume, super smart colleagues to learn from Company has become too big to care about employee experience 1 Great atmosphere Good company environment to those in the geekdom fans. You will find a group you can belong to. The hours were set but you could change them if needed. Like minded co workers Its a shame they closed the salt lake branch Very Fun Work Environment Netflix was one of the most enjoyable jobs I've ever held. The culture is all inclusive and encourages self expression. The only complaint I had was that the hours could tend to be terribly inconvenient. Overall, a better than average job. Productive and fun place Netflix is the world's leading streaming entertainment service with 183 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries and feature films across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on any internet-connected screen. Members can play, pause and resume watching, all without adverts or commitments. Highly competitive Lots of amenities and free food. Highly competitive environment. Hard to balance personal life /work. Even though you're supposed to be able to take vacations freely, it's actually not that easy. Netflix culture is taken very seriously. Team work was good and the bad about Netflix was never offering more of myself. I enjoyed the position and Netflix employee were friendly and helpful. Netflix security were a group of well prepared individuals. All in all Netflix is a well established organization with plenty of growth. Netflix outsourced their customer service to the Philippines and layed off tons. It was a decent job until it was outsourced to the Philippines, which made me lose all respect for the people at Netflix. Netflix is more concerned about profits than they are about helping their country of origin. None. Outsourced thousands of jobs Great to work with Netflix I worked as a project hire but interacted with many Netflix employees. All good people with an eye for quality. The interaction with them was pleasant and professional. Enjoyed working with everyone there. Don't even think about it Racists managers and co-workers. Extremely levels of favoritism with white drivers and discrimination with black and Hispanics. Manager created a route just to help her white favorite guy who did a lot of traffic and company rules violations and never was written up. Good place to work if you are white otherwise be prepare to be discriminated. No Spanish speak allow. Great Environment A place where you can learn basic customer service skills and a very relaxed environment. Calls were scripted, but you are allowed to be personable with makes it a great experience. Great Company, Tough Culture, Great CEO Netflix has continued to adapt their culture to broadly include more focus on diversity and inclusion. This has developed the work force and also helped bring a larger pool of candidates. There are still some pain points around hiring the right person for the right job. Fear is in the fabric of every employee and everyone knows that they have an expiration date. There are brilliant jerks but more jerks that are not brilliant in high-level roles. Netflix leans into risk with everything they do, which in most cases works extremely well. The hardest part of Netflix is that it becomes more important than anything else in your life so there is no work-life balance. If you can navigate through all of the entitlement, it can still be a good place to work until you can't anymore. The best thing about Netflix is the people, turnover is above 40%, which means that time is wasted on bringing in new employees instead of investing in existing ones. Fun Place to work at helping customers choose their plan, to make sure you have an internet connection and not satellite, very good, excellent, leaving, being able to watch tv and put netflix on different devices Overall and interesting experience learned a lot Netflix was interesting but fun at the same time. Could have been better management and, more clarity in certain aspects of the job. Co workers were ok and the location as well as job at hand were fine. Worked on 2 Netflix productions Worked under the worst people of all the productions I’ve been on. Not sure if it was because of Netflix’s hiring or the tight budget. Either way, the office was always understaffed and not only were the people not great, but I also felt extremely overworked. Not too bad Netflix was a great place to work with, the people and management were amazing. Only con is they outsourced their customer service and that new company doesn’t have great benefits at all. The calls are also non stop and they weren’t very flexible with my shift. Working for Netflix Great opportunity to learn and advanced in the field. Throuout my experience with my crew I had a great time. Fun people and just an overall great experience. Fast pace work enviornment that provides a lot of experience This environment allows your to develop problem solving skills within the Film, TV, and Commercial production world. Would recommend if interested in working in production. Engaging and fast-paced environment I was brought in to work on location. There were days with long hours, which was occasionally tough, but the Accounting department was upbeat and interesting. I learned to handle clerical accounting responsibilities with management being incredibly helpful and encouraging. Working on location was exciting because I got to see a good bit of the behind the scenes work that go into creating a film. My time at the flix I made some great friends and memories there. I got some amazing opportunities that I would not have gotten before since DVD headquarters was at our location. 8/10 would work there again. Competitive workplace, great values but poor management Netflix as a company is amazing. Their product and values are bar none. The Netflix culture is unlike anything else and fun to be a part of. The only downfall over time has been their lack of communication and leadership at certain positions. Mismanagement and wages that havent kept up with the cost of living contribute to low agent morale and a numbers driven culture instead of behavior driven. All in all a great job that is very valuable but there is a great disconnect between working directly with Netflix, and working for one of their BPO contact centers as the focus seems to be on cost cutting and sending everything overseas. They were good for a while I came in before everything got sold out and got to watch a great thing fall apart when it when front netflix to 24-7 intouch.. everything went down hill. But they were already acting up. High Performance Culture to Challenge You Netflix asks for a lot from its employees. They pay well, but it's not uncommon for your family to feel like they're the second priority. You are asked to show up fully and with vulnerability (aka seek feedback and give feedback), but the risk is you're then judged. There is not a lot of sincere compassion or curiosity from leadership for the employee experience. The sentiment is""love it or leave it"" and ""it's not for everybody."" That lack of empathy plays out even more harshly if an employee is from a historically excluded community. High compensation, great opportunity to grow your resume, super smart colleagues to learn from Company has become too big to care about employee experience 1 Standard production work Working as a production assistant on a Netflix project. Really the same as working for any other studio. Netflix is more hands off than most other studios. 1 Great experience Worked with some of the most talented writers/producers in the industry. Everyday was exciting and a challenge - I learned something new everyday. Was a pleasure seeing the writers create new episodes. Not bad Working freelance with them made me feel like part of something bigger. a really neat company to work for. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to get into the streaming space. Renowned streaming service and great employer My time as an employee for Netflix was truly life-changing. I got my dream job and had the opportunity to get my foot in the door. I learned more about the industry working this job than any class could have ever taught me. Productive, alot to learn Very understanding company Typical day at work is taking calls back to back and being able to breath thru the calls if you need to. We learn alot about different verbiage and it helps out our outside life at work. Management is very good to us also providing meals for their employees Hardiest about this job is taking calls none stop Best part is be able to want to come to work instead of not enjoying it. Free Meals Busy on mondays Awesome all around From the benefits to the pay everything was top of the market. This was the highest paying entry level job near me for awhile. Holiday pay plus a lot of time additional pay or prizes could be awarded for picking up OT. Great pay, benefits, easy job, free Netflix Repetitive Fun! This place was so much fun to work! It closed down in Denver however when it was open it employed so many people and we all really enjoyed working for a fun company. Free netflix Excellent Company with Great Benefits/Pay The Netflix culture is a one of a kind. Great benefits/pay. Freedom, and Resposibility. Great support from all areas. Teamwork is required to make things happen. Great enviroment Early hours Overall good Best job i had in all honesty. Very helpful staff, along with great benefits and flexible schedules, made this a awesome place to work at. If the company was still here, i would still be working there. Too good to be true! This has been hands down the best job I've ever had. No uniform, flexible schedule, and the culture that values diversity, innovation, inclusion, integrity, and judgement. I made real changes that improved not only my fellow coworkers experience but customers as well. This job taught me what respect and transparency in the workplace looks like. Fun workplace, friendly environment Fun workplace, friendly environment, family and goal oriented. You get the feeling of being apart of a family more than just a regular team. Loved working here, relocation cause me to resign. One of the best cultures I have ever had the pleasure to work in Netflix is amazing! I loved the culture, the energy, the people, and miss it everyday. More companies need to take Netflix's lead when it comes to culture. Not a great place to work I honestly feel like its not the best place to work. I dont feel like they really care about there employees and the work schedule was super long and didn't really fit. I loved working there I loved loved loved working there but they left Texas. Gave me the opportunity to move to Colorado with the company but I could not move unfortunately. Horrible work place Management is terrible. Employees are very messy. RUN RUN RUN!!! Staff is very unprofessional. They barely give raises. Favoritism to long time employees no one is treated equal Great Company with Even Greater Values Working here is unlike any other career. The people and the dynamics are a combination for success. Here you will be pushed to your boundaries and challenge existing ideas. Not crowded and very fun place to work Management were hands on to help and see to it that you deliver on your duties. But was a very good place to work. And everyone is given a fair chance to learn and grow. fun, relaxed, and entertaining environment! Easy going management, knowledgeable management team. Workplace culture-high energy , diverse group age wise. Fast paced. Very flexible schedule for college students, parents, etc. Fast paced, but fun workplace. Netflix is an amazing company to work for. Their culture was great, there were always opportunities to advance in the workplace, and the managers there were always willing to help you, whether it was to advance within Netflix or outside of the company. The hours were great, and the job was very fast paced. It's a high-volume call center. It's to be expected to get about 50-60 calls a day. Very rarely did you get a negative or angry call. Overall, it was a great company to work for! productive and multi tasking dealing with different customers and issues.... resolving problems ...... i think it was a great experience and learning new things .. dealing with different accent"
Uber|" Pay has gone down over the years When I first started, the pay was great! But now with gas prices and the lack of tips from customers, it's not worth it anymore. I had planned on doing this job through retirement but the pay has gone down and you have to work longer hours and spend more money on gas to get what I used to 4 years ago.

Freedom to decide own schedule What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Low pay Drunk riders Frustration to reach support What is the work environment and culture like at the company? They do not care about drivers What is a typical day like for you at the company? 12 hours shift Not fair pay They take more than 50% of what the passenger pays The passenger is always right regardless, they’ll deactivate your account for no reason You can make more money with them but trust me you have to pay for a lot of things from gas and maintenance of your vehicle Meh The amount you get per delivery isn't great and people that don't tip leaves you with nothing. I made only 4 dollars yesterday. Then they send ypu jobs that are far which is a waste of gas. I love being my own boss It's easy, you work whenever you want to, diverse, I just wish it was a set paid amount. Takes a while to learn the ins and outs of the app/best times to work. Good for some quick money but that's it. I still work here after 5 and a half years because of family circumstances but as soon as I get a work-from-home job I will leave. With fuel costs going up we did get some extra compensation but not enough. Quick money Not enough compensation; if a rider has a complaint, the driver is at fault or even considered-the support staff treat the driver like garbage. its great to work here , the managment is supportive and provides u grt work life balance and there is alot of learning i have been working here for the last 2 years and its been a great journey overall , i have learned alot in this firm and it helped me grow . the pay overall was quite good and the firm provides great flexibility during work. Make your own schedule Make your own schedule. Possibly to make money. All you have to do is work. I wish they didn’t take so much money from us riders to be they pay for example $20 I get paid 9 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? Very unprofessional system. I applied for a job with them and they kept doing a background check in a state that I was not even trying to work at and denying my application. If they had that in the background check in the current state, everything would’ve been 100% fine. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Tips not being delivered as promised. Customers promising a high-tip, and after the delivery they would not tip at all or they would lower the tip. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? The work culture was Fair What is a typical day like for you at the company? I really enjoyed working for the company. It was exciting and adventurous every day. summary is obvious At times the earnings are great. Mostly that's on Fridays, nights and weekends. Easy to get burn out. Have to fight to stay motivated. If the pay was a a few bucks more per hour I wouldn't be looking for something else. Work when you want. Be your own boss. Great tax write offs. A monotonous grind. Paying for gas. Driving in stressful situations/areas. 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Being able to make my own hours. Plus all the benifits Uber gives you for driving. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? You never know the kind of people you could be picking up. I've had my fair share of unpleasant experiences. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Very positive, energetic, and motivational. What is a typical day like for you at the company? I start my day by cleaning, sanitizing, and doing daily maintenance on my vehicle. I will fill up on fuel, clean the outside and detail and sanitize the inside. Then I would get everything I will need while working; phone charger, a drink, and music. I begin with loging on to the app. From there I will drive to the hotspots and wait for a ride. Once I get a ride I will confirm the pick up and head in that direction. When I arrive I make sure to park as close to the pick up spot as I can, while making sure it a safe location. I will proceed to notify the client that I have arrived. When the client gets in, I let them know that seat belts are required by law. I would then confirm the drop off. From there, I will fallow all traffic laws and proceed to the drop off. Once we arrive I confirm the location and drop them off. The People The Good about working for Uber, is independence of the Job. I have the options to work when I want to and for how long I want to. I also have the options to accept a job or reject it without being in default. I enjoy working for them by meeting new people daily and offering to help them. We have wonderful and Healthy conversations about different subjects, in my vehicle. Now the Bad thing about Uber is sometimes the pay don't match the distance drive. Example to go 4.5-8 miles and you're paid from $4.85 to $8.60. or 22 miles for $16.80. it seems a little off balance, Because the gas and time must account for the distance drive. They must balance out and sometimes it doesn't. Therefore, for me this is a temporary assignment to get my bills paid. Independence Less pay for the distance drive. Flexible Schedule Decent pay and scheduling. Only worth it for me to pick and choose orders that pay well enough per mile. Otherwise can be hard to make decent money after paying your own gas, insurance, oil changes, etc Not attractive anymore Ubers pay has gone down significantly. There is less opportunity for bonuses and their customer service is ignorant and their reps have the thickest foreign accent which makes is almost impossible to understand sometimes. They used to be a great company with great pay and benefit. But now since inflation is rising people don’t tip anymore like they used to, and Uber doesn't put in any effort to compensate their drivers fairly. Most cab or taxi services used to charge $1-$1.50 per mile. We’ll guess what, Uber pays you at the most 0.50 cents per mile. Then you have to pay for your own gas, and the thousands of dollars in car maintenance. Not worth it anymore. Dead end job for a corporation that doesn’t care about your life at all Wages keep getting smaller as they take a larger cut with each passing day, support is non existent in the any dangerous event, not worth the wear on your car and a terribly functioning app. Work when you want You won’t make a lot, people judge you for being a driver and you have no social life period. 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? I work my own hours. I'm the boss. No supervisor over my shoulder, yelling and screaming at me. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? The other ignorant drivers that cause wrecks or try to cause wrecks. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? I enjoy work for myself, so my environment is the way I choose it to be. The culture with Uber is you're 1099, make sure you have a dash cam to record all your riders. Riders will lie to get their ride for free. The dash cam help provide footage from the ride and can be proof if something happens or it something was said. What is a typical day like for you at the company? I got cleaned up, clean the inside of my vehicle, and get a good carwash. Get refreshments: bottled water, gums, and some snacks. I turn on my Uber app. Wait for a ride sometimes is maybe a couples seconds to about 5 minutes. Accept the ride and go get the ride. Comfirm their name and destination. Take the rider to their destination. Get paid. Pay has gone down over the years When I first started, the pay was great! But now with gas prices and the lack of tips from customers, it's not worth it anymore. I had planned on doing this job through retirement but the pay has gone down and you have to work longer hours and spend more money on gas to get what I used to 4 years ago. Flexibility Pay, price of gas Best place to work working at uber has been amazing. great managers and teams, very supportive, great pay and additional comp. Beautiful tech office and mobility- a top place in tech for a reason! unlimited pto, free breakfast/lunch/dinner, in office HH, causal dress code, hybrid, free uber credits, 17% uber discount, free therapy, 401k hybrid Very stressful but good networking It really just depends on how you treat the customers and how clean your car is and follow all the rules. The reality is you are picking up people from all walks of life so you have to maintain your composure and you deal with people that are intoxicated but also deal with very nice people. It's just a lot of wear and tear on a vehicle. It's one of those things if you do it you need to be the best at it or not do it at all. Fun and flexible If you enjoy driving and understand expenses of being an independent contractor, then it is a great opportunity. Must understand profit margins and cost of business, not just general income. Flexible Flexible. Create my own schedule. Ran approximately 30-40 hours per week...mainly wwwkends. Enjoyed working weekends evenings. Surprisingly not a lot of intoxicated passenger issues for me. Good It’s a good job depending on where you work.as long as you keep a steady flow there’s no reason why you can’t make good money.keep doing it it works no matter what Lousy compensation. Lousy incentives. I think every Uber driver would agree that the pay is insulting. The promotional events are almost impossible to achieve without spending a huge amount on fuel and time needed to execute the numbers of trips. Flexibility Pay, pay, pay. Ok Driving for Uber is easy and fair but has it’s own challenges. You can either get paid good or not depending on how hard you work but be very careful on your rides If you love driving it’s the job for you the best part of it is independence Great company it helped me communicate with people by forcing me to talk at times it pretty much got me out of the shy person I was when I started and the best part about the job is having awesome conversation with people you won’t ever see again pretty much you become a therapist for a couple hours I mean you like to talk You do it only when you have to Never compare it with a decent job but do it when you need to survive and you have no other options You won’t even make the minimum wage if you calculate all the expenses like gas and car expenses Average part time job I worked as Ubereats driver when I was in school. I would say it's pretty good for a student if you know the city and how to drive safely. You don't have to have expensive car insurance to work because you're not carrying people around. The cons are low paid, bad restaurants, and unreasonable customers that you have to expect when doing this job. Free schedule Paid low Making your own schedule and not having a boss. I personally love this because as a full time college student, I get the flexibility of being able to attend school. Also, being able to work when I want. Flexible Flexible, and you get to decide when and where you work. The money can be good, you just have to know when and where to drive. They give great bonuses. Perks v. Pitfalls The fact that you can set your own schedule, and work around hours that fit perfect for your lifestyle is an unparalleled experience. However the pay is a bit less then it should be, especially when you compare it to companies like DoorDash, and GrubHub. At times it does feel overwhelming, but this is something you get used to as you learn to handle multiple deliveries at once. Overall not a bad place to work at all, but best as a secondary source of income! Work on your own Schedule Pay is substandard Great job Love the flexibility you could work when you want meet new people love the freedom no supervisor down your neck but put lots of miles and wear and tear on car Fun and flexible Great flexibility Good Pay. I love creating my own schedule and meeting new people on a daily basis. Also the pay is completely controlled by you. Also the incentives or driving goals help bump up your pay! Not Worth It Uber actually ONLY cares about the riders and not the drivers which are the mediators for the business and the riders. I’ve experienced quite a bit of wasted gas and some very disrespectful riders as well and Uber gives you a hard time compensating you as their driver for these things as well. You can drive whenever you desire. Uber cares nothing about their drivers. Productive Driving for Uber is ok, you literally have to drive for hours to see good money. During the holidays it’s a little better. You have. To be consistent in order to see good money. Do not work for this company is very awful. Very bad company your life cars balance will be affected this company do not care about you and any person the work for them please do not work in this your life will be destroyed. Overall it’s fast money I love that we can get paid the same day. I work when I feel like it and take breaks whenever. The only thing I hate is that Uber takes up to 47% of each trip you do. I once had a trip that the rider paid $187.10 and I only got back $99.07. 2 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Flexible hours What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Many requests for miserable payment Frustration with some customers Traffic, traffic, traffic Pay has gone down over the years When I first started, the pay was great! But now with gas prices and the lack of tips from customers, it's not worth it anymore. I had planned on doing this job through retirement but the pay has gone down and you have to work longer hours and spend more money on gas to get what I used to 4 years ago. Flexibility Pay, price of gas driving for uber is so stressful and uber is is not feeling the pain of there drivers, the pay is going down in my city in Indianapolis. i drive uber 6 days in a week, sometimes 7 days in other to many a living. to make money in uber you have to drive very long hours including surge. in a day there is no surge you will struggle to make money for gas, especially on uber x where there are not enough passengers in uber xl Fast past Fast paced workplace. Decent pay if you own your own car. I worked about 8 hours everyday and made no less than $200 most days. The bad thing is that you are self employed and have to pay taxes at the end of the year. Easy job bad pay Uber pockets most of the money you get and the tip is expected to make up the difference. Restaurants don’t want to work with you because half the drivers give the restaurant staff a hard time. Great people to work with Amazing people who are super smart - feel very fortunate to work with people who are driven, motivated, and passionate about the company. No major cons about the place. Don’t do it Pay is very little for all the repairs and gas involved. Pay is low so very low. People puke in your car. No benefits, Uber does not care about you or your safety. Greed! worst company to work for, they are too greedy they take most of the pay, There is no good bonuses, They never care about what's going on about the drivers, the worst thing ever if rider is complaining about the driver they will take what the rider say as it true they will never do an investigation to see if the rider complain is right or wrong, If I want to rate Uber I have to write a book of how bad they are. can work any day/time they take most of the money no good bonuses Quick cash type work Overall uber can help with quick cash but in the long run uber will begin to do things to your account as if saying its time to quit as a driver. The money is nice, but the help, professionalism and feeling of appreciation is most definitely not there. Fast cash No sick days or anything in that nature. 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Wonderful people I’ve met along the way I love it unfortunately I couldn’t make no where near the money I made lots before pandemics lockdown What is the most stressful part about working at the company? No stress I was actually a lot less stressful when I drove for uber What is the work environment and culture like at the company? I wasn’t at the company What is a typical day like for you at the company? I set my schedule and my preference was 4-9am and 3-11pm Good times Just me myself and I 1 boss which was I Great times just shitee pay for the mileage and gas prices it’s not worth it now back when I was doing it yeah but not now unless you play it smart and get electric car You are your own boss Shyte pay, 90% of it comes from tips, if you don’t get the right types of customers you didn’t make shyte Good as a part time Only if gas prices are low this os worth it and Uber eats is terrible u get paid so little compare to all the hoops u have to jump for the customers. Is good for part time that’s it Flexible hours- terrible compensation I drove with Uber for 4 years, and my expenses FAR exceeded the “income” the first 2 years. If you care about your vehicle, this job IS NOT for you. Sure you get some decent people riding in your vehicle who respect you and YOUR property, but you get a lot of passengers who seem to think that because they’ve hired you to get from point “A” to point “B”, they OWN you and your vehicle, not to mention the occasional “whack job” that makes you feel threatened, to say the least. The company cares nothing in helping you recoup for any damage your vehicle sustains due to rider carelessness/disrespect. They’re ONLY concern is keeping their “clients” happy. Overall, a very unpleasant, though albeit flexible working environment. 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? Terrible rate of pay. Quit and find real employment What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Low wages. Customer service is ok however doesn't matter when they try paying 50 cents a mile. Will probably soon be a 25 c a mile Was ok at first Uber is cutting pay in half offering ridiculous rides. It was ok years ago and when covid hit the company went down. Hill. We are basically making money to put gas back in our vehicles Greats place to work Highly recommend Uber. Great step post consulting. Appreciate the workload balance provided coupled with opportunities for growth in roles, internal movements and region transfers. Keeps you busy! I’ve been driving for Uber for 4 years now and all I can say is, it’s a job that you make what you want to make. You’re in charge of your money. You can work as many hours as you want, or not work at all with zero consequences. You set your own goals and drive wherever you want. You can stay in your city or drive people to other states in general. Flexible hours, no limit to the money you can make You have to use your own car, minimum 30-40k miles a year Excellent side job You need to be consistent with work hours to succeed. It was nice being paid at the end of your shift. There are no benefits. This is a good job to supplement your income. 3 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Flexible hours What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Pay is not good most of the time 3 stars What is the best part of working at the company? FLeixible hours What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Traffic and traveling to the ride requests to see if its worth my time What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Costumers can be demanding What is a typical day like for you at the company? Very stresfull and unrewarding Absolute scam When I first started, pay was decent but now they have taken the liberty of scewing drivers out of a decent wage with various tactics. I would not start driving for them now Good Good side hustle. Can be done full time too you just have to learn your driving market and be smart when budgeting for car maintenance. The more you drive the more you make Pay has gone down over the years When I first started, the pay was great! But now with gas prices and the lack of tips from customers, it's not worth it anymore. I had planned on doing this job through retirement but the pay has gone down and you have to work longer hours and spend more money on gas to get what I used to 4 years ago. Flexibility Pay, price of gas Great Flexibility Nice to be able to work when you want and for how long you want. No one to report to. Hard to get a quick answer when unsure of delivery. App works well most of the time 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? No direct boss What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Uber claiming they take 25% of fares when in reality it’s 50-70% every time What is the work environment and culture like at the company? It’s chill Terrible job with an awful company I am a full-time Uber driver and can say that while the flexibility to work around my schedule is nice, there isn't much else to enjoy. Uber does not pay drivers well and has shown on a consistent basis to have zero desire to ever do so. A good part-time gig. I mainly drive in the afternoon or on the weekends. My overall experience has been positive, but I don't think it's something you would want to to do long-term or full-time. Feel extremely taken advantage of The pay is ridiculous. Uber takes approximately 70% of all rides. Drivers put their life on the line, pay for the vehicle, the insurance, the registration, the gas, maintenance, etc. and Uber has the audacity to give the driver as low as $4.44 per ride on average. Flexible time schedule Compensation Easy work You can work on your own time. Working any hours you want. Is good to me. You can turn on the app and make $3.00 to $150 off one trip. Sounds good to me. You can switch over and do Uber eats and ride with whoever you want and get to ride around site seeing making money $$$ 4 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Flexible and helping Kern County! What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Traffic and orders not fulfilled properly during peek hours. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? All over the map! What is a typical day like for you at the company? Driving very carefully and remembering every detail. Abandon ship Sucks. My advice learn a trade because the company is going under fast. It’s decent money if you have no where else to work. The fares aren’t good and they limit the amount you can be tipped. It’s like they don’t want you to make any money at all. 4 stars What is the best part of working at the company? The amount of available delivery in the course of a day What is the most stressful part about working at the company? I didn’t have that in my available work time but the way I was able to set up my routine made it easier to use the service’s What is the work environment and culture like at the company? The work itself was okay but it wasn’t always easy to phone in a bad customer call or bad address due to gps failure What is a typical day like for you at the company? Fairly easy with few things to worry about Steady For the most part Gainesville is a college town so majority of rides are students. Most will not tip but steady stream of rides will ensure you at least make something decent. I’ve been doing it for a year and a half and it’s pretty simple and easy. Worst part is when school is out there is a dramatic change in how many rides you get. Average 8 hours can get you at least 20-30 rides equaling around 100-150.. when school is out you are lucky to get 20 rides in 2 full days. Experiences can vary but for me summer is always the worst time of year to Uber here. Stressing If u enjoy making no money to sit in traffic and hear obnoxious people, this is the type of job for you. The support team also does not care about you or what happened. Uber has gone downhill in the past year I live in San Antonio but have to commute to Austin if I hope to make any money on the weekends. They hired too many drivers and went from taking 25% of the fare to sometimes 50%-65%. With so many drivers on the road in my city I can no longer work overnight and expect to make money by having consistent rides. I've noticed during times that I haven't received a ride request for 20 minutes that the next 2 or 3 would only put me on pace to make $15-16$ an hour BEFORE gas.. They lowball the offers knowing that some desperate soul will take it.. I advise anyone who might be interested to find something else unless they enjoy working Thur-Mon nights because you won't make much money any other times even in a big city like Austin.. Make your own schedule Good flexibility The flexibility is great but everything else is a little subpar. You need to budget your own taxes, keep up maintenance, pay for gas, and deal with customers. You can make good money if you want to work late into the night. Your car will take an absolute beating though. No Putting in the money to get my TLC license with so much work opportunity in New York probably wasn't my best idea. They weren't very supportive. Both them and the rental companies they worked with didn't really seem to support their drivers or care about their needs. 2 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Freedom! Liked working when I wanted! Pay sucks! My car was worthless after 200k miles! Good luck!~ What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Rude customers and short no paying rides! What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Is none! Your an independent contractor! What is a typical day like for you at the company? Done with this interview! 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? Flexibility to work when you want What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Trying to meet quotas, rude passengers 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Work at your own pace What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Rude people What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Not applicable What is a typical day like for you at the company? Nice driving scenery and meeting great people only part time If you are thinking about working this full time don't. Its not worth it. Its great for part time purposes then yeah go for it but doing uber full time isn't what its cracked up to be. Long periods of boredom. Waiting for interminable airport fares. I have worked for Uber for 7 years. Started off, there was considerable enthusiasm. As time went on, they attempted after a short time off to start me at the new rate---Which I do not understand how ANYONE makes a living at this rate--they have cut the rate twice since then.| It is good as a desperate stop-gap measurement. When you REALLY need money, give uber a try. Flexibility is nice but not very stable It is great to set your own schedule, but the pay varies from time of day to season and such. It’s a lot of wear and tear on your own vehicle. I recommend if you have thick skin. Pay has gone down over the years When I first started, the pay was great! But now with gas prices and the lack of tips from customers, it's not worth it anymore. I had planned on doing this job through retirement but the pay has gone down and you have to work longer hours and spend more money on gas to get what I used to 4 years ago. Flexibility Pay, price of gas Gig job Best part is setting your own schedule. Worse is pay. Car maintenance and gas can take a big chunk. My experience with customers has been fairly positive. It depends on areas you choose to drive. Easy supplemental income. Meh Lots of pay cut and low quests sucks so at least the pay is a little small sometimes but not where you want it. Hope the fare goes up but don’t take too long to keep us hanging I Am able to set my own hours. I really liked working for Uber until gas prices went through the roof. Had to stop driving for them because gas prices went to high very fast. I enjoyed the interaction with customers on a daily basis. I was able to set my own hours. Pay rate and company customer service for drivers. Good pay but no appreciation A good and flexible job , but as everything is done automatically through the app , if anything is wrong the support is usually not able to fix it , I've had my account blocked for 20 days because I had to watch a video but meanwhile I called the support and got even to their office and their only solution was to wait, after waiting I watched the videos and the account opened Flexibility Everything else Safety First It’s ok! My first week I was able to make $1200. Only complaints are not all cites have Uber passengers & also some cities don’t tell you where you’re going to pick up your passengers. Ok for a side gig Pay is lousy, customer service sucks, when you call rarely get someone who speaks decent english. It's an alright side gig. I only drive on the weekends. They don’t care about you, only about the money They don’t care about you, only about the money. Very bad customer service. Uber takes more than 40 percent of your money. They treat you like a number only 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Making your own hours What is the most stressful part about working at the company? They dont allow you to be an independent contractor. Making your own decisions to pick and choose what you want to do without penalties What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Freedom to work when you want to What is a typical day like for you at the company? Constantly moving Sometimes fun sometimes time challenge to deal with drunk customer Cost of driving is higher the fair is to low %60 of our earning gos towards expenses cost of living and products getting hair day by day and the pay the same fair since the gas was $3.20 Na Health insurance Flexibility Uber is a self employment option. Your pay is based on the number of rides and how long you drive, daily & weekly. No regular benefits are provided, such as 401k and health insurance. There are pay incentives offered. No PTO as you can take off any time you wish. Also, there are offers of discounts for car repairs and other things. I never spoke to any individual throughout the entire hiring process. I hope this answers some of the other questions I left blank. Flexible schedule No benefits Fun and productive Amazing job over all they teach you everything you need to know to get started, recently started working from home so it’s a big plus. Very caring company and compensation is nice as well Good gig but you have to be smart to make money This company can be on top if ghey treat their drivers better. The ones who have seniority treat them as such. We drive safe we treat your clients like royalty so we deserve the best compensation. Sometimes we don't get tupped and yall trying to take the little surge money we earn. Beware I know you don’t know me, but I learned first hand that Uber will not ever care about you. It doesn’t matter how long you work there how much mileage you put on you car or how many hours you work you will never get ahead. I learned the hard way it took 6 years for me to notice and it was when I went to buy a car and found out I had lost over $20,000 working for them. I didn’t realize it until the finance manager explained my taxes to me. Also when I was tboned in a parking lot not my fault at all. I was suspended without pay and no car. This company could care less about you they only want to make a profit at the end of the day. Please for the love of everything stay away for yourselves don’t do what I did and not know. It’s not worth it. Flexible Lost over $20, 000 Great For Extra Income Great place to work for, for extra income. If you're in college or already working a second job and you need a break from being bossed around, but need to make more money this is an easy and great job. Recommend! Driver Uber is great for earning fast cash. But you have to work hard and long hours if your going to make a career. You have to keep track of your expenses, because they become your taxes paid. The customers I meet, 9 out of 10 times are incredible and fun to talk to. If you need money to make it to your next step in life, Uber is perfect! Set your own hours, bonuses can be excellent! Gas prices and car repairs Good pay if you put the time in Good side gig if you can put in the time. Have to be self-motivated. Wish they compensated for Maintenance gas and miles but it's the trade-off. Count your miles and save gas receipts so you can write off on taxes. It's great not to be tied down to a desk People need transportation and I like people so it works for me. However, when you find out the company receives most of the proceeds it can be disheartening. When there is opportunity to make more money there is more traffic so you never advance. Flexible Pay Great money in Philly Uber is great if you know what your doing with things like taxes, driving, knowing how to talk with everyone, when and what kind of car to purchase, and how to best maximize your time. I am consistently in the top 5% of money earnings for the last 5 years and I buy 2 cars a year for the tax benefits and resale of the car before the warranty runs out. Know what you are doing or you will be disappointed once you factor in all your time and costs. Good luck! Driver Uber Driver Partner Fun Shareriding base app gig job. Opportunity to interact with different people and have great conversations while transporting them to desired destination. And deliver products and good by request from app users. And deliver food and other goods by request from participating customers. Work your own hours. Sometimes very challenging demands for certain deliveries. Great gig, but communication could be better. I like working for Uber, but they could do a better job of sending drivers better information about their ride. I recommend it to anyone who’s is interested in making money by driving."
Yext|" Excellent CEO -Lucky to have worked here I was given an opportunity to be in on the first 200 employees. Growth was phenomenal in terms of sales and verticals. The CEO is brilliant (Howard Lerman) and some of the people below him are cut throat. The sales roles are 100% about sales. A lot to learn as the technology moved so fast, but excellent product and teams around the whole organization Ceo, Comp, Office, Lunch and dinner through seemless, ONWARD always Got big fast. IPO built some ego maniacs. Not much bad to say though. 1 Lots of the drawbacks of a scaling company without the benefits of scale If you value work-life balance, do not work here. It's a friendly environment, and fairly young, but most people are working 9-6, and sometimes 9-7. There's not really a culture of efficiency or optimizing time, and you end up getting lots of pointless meetings that make it tougher to get work done. The upper management was very big on being in-person, which further contributed to a culture of work harder not smarter, and demonstrating your worth in terms of staying later and always being on. The management team is only 1-2 years older than most of the TEMs, and is usually promoted from within. Unfortunately, there is no formal training for managers. It didn't seem like my managers were comfortable giving negative feedback, nor did it seem like they were able to outline times when my performance fell short of expectations (or just clearly outline expectations), which made it much tougher to learn. There isn't any training on the soft skills aspect of the job which I had received in other consulting style roles. We were given a pretty rapid two weeks of on boarding on the software, and then let loose. It felt like it was expected for most people to come in with much of the knowledge they needed to do their job. The coaching was sub-par, and it was hard to find mentorship. The median age of my floor was probably 25 or 26. There were very people with more than 5 or 10 years of work experience and very few people with obligations outside of work (like families). It contributed to a grindset mentality that made it feel more like investment banking or consulting than a tech company. Free lunches, young company, lots of social activities (like 1-2 happy hours a week in the summer) Weak management, lack of training, sink or swim attitude Great Place to Work! I enjoyed working here - I had no experience in Data Entry but my team helped and trained me. Weekly meetings were invigorating and enjoyable. It was a great job :) Good place to grow A typical day at work includes commuting into the office, eating free breakfast from one of our snack kitchens, and then hitting the phones until the afternoon. Yext is only my second job out of college, but I can confidently say I see myself growing my career here for the next several years. Brand new HQ, free lunches in the NYC office, ClassPass membership, good healthcare benefits I wish there was an onsite gym, pay isn't as competitive as other tech companies, and the WFM policy is confusing Yext really is a great place to work! I have enjoyed growing my career at Yext over the past 4 years. While the company is very different than it was when I started, I still believe the core culture and values remain the same. Yes, there have been leadership changes, which includes major changes that have happed over the past few months (CEO & CFO), but that was on the individual's own accord and has nothing to do with being ""pushed out"" or whatever the media says. All that aside, I'm excited to see where the company goes under our new leadership! We have an incredible product, and even more incredible people creating it. Great colleagues, Exec board has no direction Pros: I've met great people working at Yext- made a lot of friends outside of the workplace. There are A LOT of smart people at this company and it inspires you to level up. Most of the time I do feel like my work has impact and compensation is decent, given we are in the midst of a global pandemic. Cons: You'll never be bored; there's always something new to work on. This is usually because directives and initiatives change constantly, with no transparency as to why or any clear direction on how to operationalize these changes. The exec board mainly exists as an echo chamber for the CEO and to serve his latest whim, regardless if it makes any sense for the business. There are certain departments put up on a pedestal and the inequity in treatment is obvious to every employee. People get promoted to leadership roles and Yext provides no training or coaching to help develop effective people leaders. It often feels like a popularity contest. Colleagues that become friends, smart employees, decent compensation packages Exec board needs a backbone, favoritism and popularity contests Values engineers and engineers get special treatment in terms of office events Overall a really good place to learn. However, the work life balance really sucks and I see people working on weekends/past 2am at times. Definitely a work hard play hard culture. tech company they don't give the tools to succeed...if you didn't understand or asked questions they couldn't clarify what they were looking for...asked me to stay for overtime but wasn't busy thru the day but bc everyone else was they wanted to me to stay extra just to see if they needed me. lunch work remotely people friendly open atmosphere management was difficult always busy no time to stop and explain Exciting place to work with great sales training! When I started at Yext, I didn't have any sales experience. They put us through a sales bootcamp and made everybody successfully close 40 deals in 40 days, or else you were let go. Given the great training program, I was able to successfully complete the training and become a Sales Associate. It was an exciting tech atmosphere and all of my colleagues and superiors were a pleasure to be around everyday. Unfortunately, the pay as a Sales Associate was very low and, at the time, I did not feel the opportunity for advancement was there. However, I have heard from former colleagues that that is no longer the case. The worst place I have worked In my 5th month of work at Yext my entire management team had quit, been fired or left my segment. The turnover is extremely high, especially with the Partnership and mid market teams. My management team never responded to me for help and at our QBR in San Diego, my direct report to manager no showed. It is a mess. Productive and fun workplace Hard work but a good work environment. Your experience at Yext will greatly vary depending upon job function. A sales person will have a much more strenuous day than other roles. Recognition Issues Employees who do a lot of the difficult work never get recognized. They are often told much later that they're an asset, and aren't given opportunities for advancement even when they voice it's something that they have an interest in and the ability to do. Career progression on some teams seems very random. Great Yext was probably the most enjoyable work experience I’ve had. The culture is A-1 the employees are like a big family that care and back each other up, I can honestly say that I looked forward to going to work every day because Yext always made me feel at home. What I learned as a Facilities’s coordinator at Yext, weather it was my daily assignments, special Service assignments, marketing event set ups, team moves or just learning the start up culture it is all valuable experience that I can take into future endeavors. Paid seemless account None Great PLace I was there pre IPO and it was great. Like a smart family. Everyone there works hard and wants to do well and they give employees every chance to do well. Incredible Culture Great place work! Be aware that the organization is experiencing tremendous growth, with that comes constant change of processes, systems and leadership. Relaxed culture Work/life balance is great Benefits are standard Unlimited PTO is awesome Opportunities to work from home Perks are pretty cool Free lunch/dinner(depending on role/hours) Pretty relaxed environment Excellent place to work. Fast-paced, innovative and thorough SaaS / sales training. Smart and technology-focused; meet timelines and innovative pipeline. Lots of upsell opportunities due to corporate innovation. Great place to work Great company to advance your career. Top-notch tech and services for businesses of all sizes. Great collaborative culture and compensation is best in class. Tech company in NYC As a Yext Sales Associate, everyday will be roughly the same as the day before. Lots of calls and emails (templates). Thankfully, the office is neat and is very 'techy'. Bro Sales Culture - + seamless account There are a lot of great people and activities. Unfortunately, management is inexperiences and the floor is chaotic. Lack of leadership leads to high churn and burn. free lunch inexperienced management You should know what you're getting into You will be on the phones for 9 hours a day. Metrics expected are to have around 5-6 hours of talk time (time spent on the line). Leads are said to be inquiring about the product, but it is realistically a cold-call environment. Be prepared to perform immediately or you will be let go. Manager's are relaxed as long as you are making your numbers. This job is what you make of it. If you are not prepared for rejection or being met with negativity on the other end of the line, this job is not for you. I loved all of my co-workers, if you can multitask, it is a fun job. Be prepared to do the same thing everyday. Seamless account of $15 a day. Cool office, good drinks and snacks. Great people. Breaks are not really breaks, eat your lunch while on the phone. Excellent CEO -Lucky to have worked here I was given an opportunity to be in on the first 200 employees. Growth was phenomenal in terms of sales and verticals. The CEO is brilliant (Howard Lerman) and some of the people below him are cut throat. The sales roles are 100% about sales. A lot to learn as the technology moved so fast, but excellent product and teams around the whole organization Ceo, Comp, Office, Lunch and dinner through seemless, ONWARD always Got big fast. IPO built some ego maniacs. Not much bad to say though. 1 Fun laid back environment Great work environment very laid back and they cover your lunch. Snacks are also included and Fridays are beer and pizza day after 4:30pm. The job has many perks but many people in the small business department don't last longer than a year. 2 Productive and creative environment Not your typical 9 to 5 job. Plenty is provided to you in the office. Has a start up feel as a company that is much larger than your average start up. A CEO with a plan and a vision who aggressively strives to achieve annual and quarterly goals. Teams and departments lead by incredibly bright and hard working professionals. Having the opportunity to speak with small to midsized business owners day in and day out was arguably the best part of the job aside from the the people that you work with. Free lunch, stocked kitchens with food, milk, coffee/tea, beer and pizza is provided on Fridays. Lack of job security depending on what department you work with. High energy sales room A typical day in the SMB sales room requires a lot of hard work, but is very enjoyable. You are surrounded by a group of young and energetic co workers. There is little to know upward mobility. Free seamless lunch revolving door Fun place to work but not a lot of opportunites for advancement Daily day is a grind. Make about 150 calls a day everyday doing the same thing. No chance of advancement unless you have been there at least 2 years and are a top seller. $10 seamless lunch no breaks, favoritism, poor upper management in SMB Fast Paced Tech Company with Unlimited Potential Yext is a fast paced, growing company that is solving a huge problem with online local business listings. Yext is a Fun place to work with many young professionals and many perks that you would expect at a NYC Tech Company. Energetic and Fun Work Environment, Driven and Motivated co-workers Yext has a really fun, relaxed work environment. It has a type of tech vibe, and the office is equipped with full snack kitchens, a game room, and a nap chair. All the people working here are incredibly smart and hard working, and they all are helping this fledgling business to grow into a powerhouse.

I have enjoyed growing my career at Yext over the past 4 years. While the company is very different than it was when I started, I still believe the core culture and values remain the same. Yes, there have been leadership changes, which includes major changes that have happed over the past few months (CEO & CFO), but that was on the individual's own accord and has nothing to do with being ""pushed out"" or whatever the media says. All that aside, I'm excited to see where the company goes under our new leadership! We have an incredible product, and even more incredible people creating it. Great colleagues, Exec board has no direction Pros: I've met great people working at Yext- made a lot of friends outside of the workplace. There are A LOT of smart people at this company and it inspires you to level up. Most of the time I do feel like my work has impact and compensation is decent, given we are in the midst of a global pandemic. Cons: You'll never be bored; there's always something new to work on. This is usually because directives and initiatives change constantly, with no transparency as to why or any clear direction on how to operationalize these changes. The exec board mainly exists as an echo chamber for the CEO and to serve his latest whim, regardless if it makes any sense for the business. There are certain departments put up on a pedestal and the inequity in treatment is obvious to every employee. People get promoted to leadership roles and Yext provides no training or coaching to help develop effective people leaders. It often feels like a popularity contest. Colleagues that become friends, smart employees, decent compensation packages Exec board needs a backbone, favoritism and popularity contests Values engineers and engineers get special treatment in terms of office events Overall a really good place to learn. However, the work life balance really sucks and I see people working on weekends/past 2am at times. Definitely a work hard play hard culture. tech company they don't give the tools to succeed...if you didn't understand or asked questions they couldn't clarify what they were looking for...asked me to stay for overtime but wasn't busy thru the day but bc everyone else was they wanted to me to stay extra just to see if they needed me. lunch work remotely people friendly open atmosphere management was difficult always busy no time to stop and explain Exciting place to work with great sales training! When I started at Yext, I didn't have any sales experience. They put us through a sales bootcamp and made everybody successfully close 40 deals in 40 days, or else you were let go. Given the great training program, I was able to successfully complete the training and become a Sales Associate. It was an exciting tech atmosphere and all of my colleagues and superiors were a pleasure to be around everyday. Unfortunately, the pay as a Sales Associate was very low and, at the time, I did not feel the opportunity for advancement was there. However, I have heard from former colleagues that that is no longer the case. The worst place I have worked In my 5th month of work at Yext my entire management team had quit, been fired or left my segment. The turnover is extremely high, especially with the Partnership and mid market teams. My management team never responded to me for help and at our QBR in San Diego, my direct report to manager no showed. It is a mess. Productive and fun workplace Hard work but a good work environment. Your experience at Yext will greatly vary depending upon job function. A sales person will have a much more strenuous day than other roles. Recognition Issues Employees who do a lot of the difficult work never get recognized. They are often told much later that they're an asset, and aren't given opportunities for advancement even when they voice it's something that they have an interest in and the ability to do. Career progression on some teams seems very random. Great Yext was probably the most enjoyable work experience I’ve had. The culture is A-1 the employees are like a big family that care and back each other up, I can honestly say that I looked forward to going to work every day because Yext always made me feel at home. What I learned as a Facilities’s coordinator at Yext, weather it was my daily assignments, special Service assignments, marketing event set ups, team moves or just learning the start up culture it is all valuable experience that I can take into future endeavors. Paid seemless account None Great PLace I was there pre IPO and it was great. Like a smart family. Everyone there works hard and wants to do well and they give employees every chance to do well. Incredible Culture Great place work! Be aware that the organization is experiencing tremendous growth, with that comes constant change of processes, systems and leadership. Relaxed culture Work/life balance is great Benefits are standard Unlimited PTO is awesome Opportunities to work from home Perks are pretty cool Free lunch/dinner(depending on role/hours) Pretty relaxed environment Excellent place to work. Fast-paced, innovative and thorough SaaS / sales training. Smart and technology-focused; meet timelines and innovative pipeline. Lots of upsell opportunities due to corporate innovation. Great place to work Great company to advance your career. Top-notch tech and services for businesses of all sizes. Great collaborative culture and compensation is best in class. Tech company in NYC As a Yext Sales Associate, everyday will be roughly the same as the day before. Lots of calls and emails (templates). Thankfully, the office is neat and is very 'techy'. Bro Sales Culture - + seamless account There are a lot of great people and activities. Unfortunately, management is inexperiences and the floor is chaotic. Lack of leadership leads to high churn and burn. free lunch inexperienced management You should know what you're getting into You will be on the phones for 9 hours a day. Metrics expected are to have around 5-6 hours of talk time (time spent on the line). Leads are said to be inquiring about the product, but it is realistically a cold-call environment. Be prepared to perform immediately or you will be let go. Manager's are relaxed as long as you are making your numbers. This job is what you make of it. If you are not prepared for rejection or being met with negativity on the other end of the line, this job is not for you. I loved all of my co-workers, if you can multitask, it is a fun job. Be prepared to do the same thing everyday. Seamless account of $15 a day. Cool office, good drinks and snacks. Great people. Breaks are not really breaks, eat your lunch while on the phone."
CACI|" Nice place to work This is a great company to work for, benefits are great in terms of medical and time-off. Management has been great, its easy to advance to other areas. They have a virtual university where you can take courses for free. 8 4 Thank you for your review! We are incredibly proud of what we have accomplished in terms of continuous learning via our Virtual University and Communities of Practice! 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? NOTHING, POOR PAY, BAD MANAGEMENT, NEED A LAWYER IF YOU WORK THERE What is the most stressful part about working at the company? LOW WAGES, COMMUTER, TRAVEL, HAVE TO FIGHT THE COMPANY TO GET WHAT YOU DUE What is the work environment and culture like at the company? CUBLICS, TEMP, BAD WORK ENVIRONMENT, SICK, COUGHING EMPLOYEES IN OPEN FLOOR PLANS What is a typical day like for you at the company? TOO HOT, TOO COLD, TOO LOUD, TOO CHEAP 1 Help Desk Specialist A job that you take for the experience people dont stay here longer than 6 months usually people just come and go its a clock in and clock out type of job management doesnt really care about anything other than meeting SLAs 1 Good pay, solid crew Great management, and the work is steady. You’re expected to work most of day, but they don’t stress you out about how early you need to be there, or how long you stay. You need to produce work. Turn hours, make money. Don’t turn, don’t make money. Simple 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? CACI, Inc tend to stay up to date with their policies, procedures and facilitate a good working environment free of clutter. The best thing is that they care about helping their staff grow and expand whenever possible. No one is left alone or ignored. Great management and supervisors (at least at my level) What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Unfamiliarity with practices, but this is something one experiences in any career. Failing and struggling is a part of life we all cannot escape. The good thing regarding CACI is that we have team players that want me to succeed. It can be hit or miss at times …that’s just a part of life :) What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Very good! My office assures that all practices and social guidelines are current and free of distraction for all people. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Guidelines and assignments are mostly self-driven. 8 hour days, mostly telework. CACI is really good about allowing for a clutter-free atmosphere. Good job if you have multiple sources of income I wouldn’t recommend this being your only source of income working as a background investigator. I have been with the company for 3 and a half years and there have been multiple stretches of 4-6 weeks where there just isn’t any work available and the company puts you on leave with out pay. My section lead is great and so are the more senior investigators in the region. Work life is balance is great. Review is inconsistent so reports will be good one day and bad the next. The metrics for production make it very difficult to meet goals. Overall the pay is decent for what it is, just don’t expect to really grow in this position. This is great for someone who is retired or has multiple sources of income. Awful Company has a toxic environment and no support , poor training , unrealistic goals no manager support and or training programs. Huh pressure to over work. No respect for life events. Great Opportunities and benefits CACI has a very diverse and progressive environment, however, the management really sucks in my opinion. There seems to be a disconnect in their values and vision versus that of the team. No real morale boosters, and hosted outings that you have to pay for on your own. lol Benefits, diversity, growth opportunities Management, No free lunches, politics Good company to build a career Benefits and engagement with employees are amazing. I like that there are opportunities, depending on location, for growth within the company. This is good for a person looking to build a career. There is always someone to talk to for any technical issue within the system and problems are taken care of quickly. - Salary: The salaries are lower than most and expected. - Onboarding: I was confused. The process isn't explained well. There is a person assigned to be a mentor during Onboarding. This person never contacted me. Nothing to add Great benefits package. 401K could be better but pretty good. Overall, it's a good place to work. Excellent staff always willing to pitch in and give help whenever and wherever its needed. Three years of work at this company, and then laid off The business group where I worked was not the best work environment. When the layoffs were announced, management was less than forthcoming, and its practices were not the best.. I learned a few things about corporate culture Management practices Worst management I have every labored under There was a severe disconnect between management and between the team that I worked on, to the extent that we were left completely to our own devices. Until a crisis arose, at which time we were blamed for the crisis and there was a huge blow up during a meeting. In 25 years in the tech business I have never had such a negative experience as this. Okay, but poor pay on the Investigations side Didn't keep up with inflation, and doesn't seem interested in continuous examination of benefits or pay scale to keep competitive. Definitely a good field to work in, but the pay is just not there for a national security position coupled with the high stress of micromanagement. Work from home High turnover and micromanagement Great Company from Start To Finish Fantastic company with transparent and caring management. Great benefits and career development resources. Leadership has shown through, most notably in navigating work during the pandemic and encourages professional growth. Spectacular company to work for all around. Management was very supportive of people Was an IT contractor for many years after retiring from the military. As a contract worker, you tend to get frequently laid off at the end of a contract. CACI was the only one that really made an effort to place their employees within the firm. CACI gave us training to allow us to grow the skills needed to qualify for future jobs. I learned classified information about multiple government agencies which was very interesting. The hardest part of the job was the long hours required to perform software testing. Always a crunch time to test and field software. Training, management support Long hours - routine 10pm and weekend Interesting place to work Worked for almost 5 years on different programs. No issue changing to any open position. There is no way I would be able to answer this question with any knowledge Week Managers Managers with poor management/ leadership skills. A manager that stand by and watch/ hands off is not a leader in my opinion. That is what you get at CACI Worst company EVER I do not recommend this job to anyone, not even my worst enemy! There’s major favoritism. The manager picks out 1 person & bullies & picks on them. There’s no help from the manager at ALL when short staffed. He’s all about himself. If it’s not his way, it’s no way. Management never investigates, just keeps picking on that one employee. Most of the time it was like being in high school all over again. Staff is required to work while being sick and NO training at all! Worried about production and paperwork than quality. Office ran by a micromanaging managers who never gives any positivity only negativity and knows nothing about running a professional office. Management needs to get in-touch with staff. Their polices do not fit all the circumstances that involve the office. Management have their own way of doing things. The staff trying to please ONE PERSON ONLY!!! There is just too much unprofessional things going on. A lot of gossip in the office with Management cover up. Pay is horrible and will have you overwhelmed! A typical day at work consisted of non stop working. There is no teamwork. Upper management will not help you. The hardest part of the job is constantly being told that you are under staffed, however no one is able to complete their job. Upper management will lie and/or make false promises repeatedly. The regional managers are a joke!!! This company is a joke. It is ran by people who have no clue what they are doing. If you have a family or a life outside of work, I do not advise you to work with them. PLEASE RUN!!!!! Enjoyed the Job; Leadership needs work I loved working background investigations. Work/Life balance in the sense of going to doctor appointments without have to ask permission was fantastic. My section lead was hands down the best supervisor I ever had and my team was great. Leadership on the other hand is questionable. A couple things that leadership told the investigations division was alarming. This is what we were told: 1. First day in the academy- “You are just a number and easily replaceable.” 2. “Since work is low, you’ll need to use your PTO if you want a better paycheck.” 3. “We have created a tier ranking system within investigations so you’ll have to compete against your colleagues to get work and make a living.” This caused people to quit because they couldn’t afford rent and were living out of their car. 4. “We are thoroughly disappointed in all of you for losing the #1 contract spot. We expected much more and we really hope you do better or else….” Turns out it was the bidding teams error. They bid too high so it wasn’t the investigations division fault. 5. When asked if investigators could apply elsewhere within the agency because we didn’t have any work due to an agency transition leadership stated on a call: “You know, the other positions within CACI require a certain level of education and experience that Background Investigators just don’t have.” CACI will probably deny all above. I remember every persons name that told us those things, all of which were on monthly leadership calls. Being told all of those things made the job difficult. The metric system is nearly impossible to meet unless Very productive and encouraging. Very peaceful environment. Everyone Excellent working environment Urdu manager was excellent. workshops were offered to upgrade our skills. Tech support was always there. Everyone was there to help and support each other. The working environment was excellent. Run I do not recommend this job to anyone, not even my worst enemy! There’s major favoritism. The manager picks out 1 person & bullies & picks on them. There’s no help from the manager at ALL when short staffed. He’s all about himself. If it’s not his way, it’s no way. Management never investigates, just keeps picking on that one employee.

They have a virtual university where you can take courses for free. 8 4 Thank you for your review! We are incredibly proud of what we have accomplished in terms of continuous learning via our Virtual University and Communities of Practice! It was a positive, professional place to work . CACI won a military contract in the Middle East. CACI contracted everyone and offered a position back. CACI knows how to do there job. Very professional and wanted to work with you . Exciting Good companyto work for, strong pay. The benefits couls be a little bit better but other than that it is a good company. I would recommend this company to anyone looking for an exciting opportunity. Great Company to work for. No complaints on the culture. I worked on a unique project so my experience may vary. The contract I worked on required long hours deployed. Everyday was something different. Paid very well Travel Duplicitous Upper Management During the 2019 to 2021 time frame, CACI over-hired Background Investigators. When the BI backlog was reduced, rather than having a reduction in force and paying unemployment benefits they put investigators on Leave without Pay. CACI wanted investigators to leave voluntarily (not getting work and not being paid was pretty big motivator for doing so). Which investigators got the limited case work was dependent on a metrics system that forced investigators to work undocumented hours (usually on weekends) to get the Weighted Testimonies per Day metric up. This made you a higher Tiered investigator and you continued to receive work assignments (though at times not enough for a full 40 hours). It soon became apparent that a lot of investigators had undocumented work hours and overtime in order to meet CACI’s metric and continue getting case assignments. All in all very reprehensible on the part of CACI management. They achieved two things, 1) not having to pay unemployment expenses by not having a reduction in force; 2) increased output from the investigators remaining because of undocumented additional work (unpaid overtime). CACI management knew this was happening, it was obvious to even the level 1 investigators. As a retiree I had other sources of income, my CACI investigator job was just additional income. However, I found I could no longer be part of this absurd pretense and resigned (use my weekends for other things). My immediate supervisor was a good manager. Duplicitous upper management. Another Defense Contractor This is just another defense contractor, no deference. About 30 days of vacation, no bonus, good 401k match. Quality of life varies from group to group. Boring You might be happy if you’re looking for a boring, low-stress place to coast until retirement. Seems like this place is stuck in the past. The pay is less than what you’ll get with similar contractors or technology companies. No talk of raises or bonuses in the time I’ve been here despite huge contracts and profit. 18 days of PTO for first 5 years and increases by 2 days for every 5 years after. Caps at 25 days after 15 years. 10 holidays. 4 weeks parental leave. 50% 401(k) match up to 8%. Vests after 3 years which is a really annoying way to pressure people into staying. No option to work 4/10 schedule. 4 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Very good benefits. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? I can't think of an stressfulness related to CACI. It's like buying a car and you won't find out what's wrong until its too late. CACI is dishonest with New Hires and the benefits they offer. The company will take advantage of you in the following ways. My recommendations are: -Don't trust other CACI employees unless you plan to spend money, socialize and become ""friends"" they all had to go through the same stuff I did below and that's how they operate to survive. -Don't use CACI's Relocation program. It is cheaper to put your stuff in storage and get everything when you arrive overseas. -Have 10,000.00 in Savings or on Credit available as you will be paying for your own transportation, and hotel stay until you find an apartment and CACI decides to allow you to be reimbursed which takes a long time as it has to be done a specific way and without error. Otherwise it will take months to get reimbursed as your requests will get kicked back constantly. -The company depends on one person for transportation when you first arrive and you will have to use public transportation after that. There was no assistance with any of the errands except for when I was in-processing and they expect you to just show up to work. Relocation - Instead of giving the new hire the money and allowing them to make reasonable decisions, CACI, hires a ""third party"" and gave them your relocation money to spend as they see fit. This person scheduling and providing relocation will overspend as much as possible to make sure you stay at least a year or else you will have to pay it all back. All of the costs for my relocation were unreasonable and its like they went with the most expensive tickets and expensive companies they I experienced a different country. They pay the rent at least. This position is not worth anyone's time unless you are just starting out in Information Technology, like to party and socialize. Not a bad place to start It was an IT helpdesk. Days were typically very busy. My regret was staying there and stagnating for as long as I did. Pay was alright. Benefits were ok. My coworkers were amazing. CACI paid for school and certs. Vacation time was a little lacking from my discussions with other IT employees at other companies. My biggest problems in an otherwise decent job, was that I had literally 5 bosses whom didn't like/talk to each other. I got conflicting information a lot and it was stressful. The other negative was that there was no room for advancement at the specific job that I was working. I had to leave to get a decent pay raise. Those criticisms are likely unique to that helpdesk job though. I'd have no problem going back to work for CACI in the future. Tuition and certificate reimbursement, healthcare was great, the people were amazing Management and a lack of upward mobility 3 stars What is the best part of working at the company? I've been working here for a couple years now and the growth is amazing. Great commander and commander of my life. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Honestly, learning the new systems and being efficient. A lot of important information is passed through you. You have to learn who can have access to what and who doesn't. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? It's really military environment. Something similar to USAA. What is a typical day like for you at the company? I mean your regular office job. Work on computers. Taking phone calls and auch. 4 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Company made improvements to their HR and technology in there years I was there. They are finally starting to act like the big boys in government contracting. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Contract situation of projects. But that's at all government contractors. The contracts I was on always seemed to be ending soon or had issues with extensions. Things got done pretty last minute on the gov. side. They do try to get employees who are loses coverage on a contract to work on other contracts. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Most folks are 100% billable, so you just work on your contract. Not a lot of company time given to development outside of what you are working on. Any hours you spend on 'fun' stuff is not billable and would be on your own time. The company is focused on delivering for their customers, which it does a good job of. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Again. Contract dependent. A lot of folks who work for the company are off-site/client-site. I was lucky to be at a company facility my whole time and the office environment is friendly and laid back. Solid Company with Great leaders, good benefits, and lower than average pay I loved working for CACI! My program and deputy program managers were fantastic! The pay was a bit lower than should be expected from my time and position but the benefits were nice. Leave was good too. They are VERY military friendly. The biggest difficulty was that they are a contracting company which means that once a contract goes away you have to work to find a new position. However, they were very helpful in the process and very flexible in changing contracts. Definitely recommend them. CACI truly promotes life-long careers and gives you the resources needed to create our ideal careers. Overall good company to work for especially if you are willing to put in the effort. Could be stressful at times but overall not a bad fit and lets you work remote as well. Ability to work remote. A lot of travel with my job. Always family first with the company. Great managers. Flexible hours if needed. Nice people to work for Nice benefits if needed telecommute options Fun people to work with They have a great 401 k plan. Lost sight of the customers needs This company spent more time worrying about making reports look pretty, than the actual work the customer contracted us for and consequently, the customer dropped the contract. Plus grading investigators should be manager responsibility not Reviewers. If you have laptop issues many times it has to be shipped back. Upper management stinks! They and team leads have favorites. Production and metrics huge issue except for favorites! Too many managers and team leads. great place great place to work. very interesting programs. managers are good with their employees. PTO is great. balance work and life is awesome. make your own hours Okay job but not great Pros: - Decent pay and benefits - Stable work schedule Cons: - A lot of micromanaging when I worked there - Had to stare at a bright screen in a dark room all day - Very monotonous work Great Work Life Balance at a Cost You won’t find better work life balance. Time flexibility, no micromanagement, decent individual autonomy on tasks. The real problem is the pay, as well as the fulfillment gained from the work. This is less to do with CACI, and more the nature of government work. You may work for years on products that will never be used, all the while being underpaid in relation to public sector work. Work life balance, low stress, no micromanagement Pay, sense of purpose in the government machine Rewarding job It’s a great company to work for, especially for entry level. I was able to get a friend hired also through their referral program. It does require a security clearance which can be a pain. Nice place to work This is a great company to work for, benefits are great in terms of medical and time-off. Management has been great, its easy to advance to other areas. They have a virtual university where you can take courses for free. 8 4 Thank you for your review! We are incredibly proud of what we have accomplished in terms of continuous learning via our Virtual University and Communities of Practice! Productive and great place to work. Theirs nothing bad about this company,not as long as i was working there.Upper management works with you,gives meaningful informaton about task at hand. Plenty room for advancement. people are friendly.Enjoyable place to work.My title was site manager for mail contract to fort monmouth and surrounding area. .I enjoyed my time with CACI,and fellow employees. 1 Leadership needs improvement I worked for CACI fo 19 1/2 years, in that time 1 promotion, saw others receive multiple hired a deputy outside of the company who had left under difficult conditions. Higher leadership is either blind or doesn't care what local managers do or require. The level I worked at was like a subsidiary of CACI. No one from the outside the local area visited more than 3 times my entire tenure. Never denied time off or PTO Leadership, Lack of, in the beginning nepotism, then cronyism and finally narcissism 1 Busy, exciting, a place where I learned new experiences My day was pretty busy, I learned how to troubleshoot various issues, my lead was the best, the workplace culture was relaxing and enjoyable to work in. The hardest part for me was if I did not know how to troubleshoot, I had use my researching skills to find out how to assess and fix the issue. My hours, oh the hours. Experiences I learned No Cons for me Management sometimes has high expectations for their field investigators. Field Investigators are highly trained by CACI to perform their duties with the US Department of Defense, Defense Counter-Intelligence, and Security Agency. High expectations with their reports for the government. Good benefits. Hard to be promoted without good metrics. Great workplace. People are friendly and helpful. I absolutely love my job and everyone I work for and around. I am given the opportunity to learn new skills which only affords me the opportunity to advance. I wish the company would offer raises and/or bonuses on an annual basis. Local management always willing to work with you. Corporate management seemed to always be more interested in making our jobs harder. Local management always willing to work with you. Corporate management seemed to always be more interested in making our jobs harder. Corporate management hurt local business. Great local management Deadlines deadlines caused by unrealistic schedules. No work/life balance. Societal bias within management and at corporate. Diversity was seen as a task and not truly embraced by the company. We were required and tracked to fill out survey for company to make the top 50 company listing. Management wasn't Lots of Job Security but, no advancement for Contract workers. You get all of the federal holidays and you can reasonably set your own hours (5-8hr days, 4-10hr days, 4-9hr & 1-4hr day). CACI is a big enough company that the work seems to be consistent, I never worried about downsizing. The work can get a little pressured at times when the work load increases but, management is very reasonable about how much work can be done in a day (you are compared to others in similar positions by various metrics) and as long as you are in the average range they leave you alone to do the work. Fantastic GIS experience with a company that is extremely well-known in the industry. The big downside is they like to hire a lot of contract workers (I was hired through Aerotek) and those contract workers have very little to no chance of moving into a permanent CACI position. Some of the other contract workers had been there for over 2 years, I only stayed a year. Industry recognition, holidays, flexible hours Contractors will stay contractors Good stepping stone to a clearance and a better job. You will work off the clock if you don't want to get fired. Think of a position as a Background Investigator as a 1-3 year stepping stone to a clearance and a better job and you'll be fine. You will work off the clock if you don't want to get fired. Remote with good pay Flexible schedules, good pay and opportunity for growth. Company culture is very important so there's periodic evaluations to make sure you're happy. nothing special Nothing special , low pay, low security, poor benefits, no encouragement, no career, no promotion, nobody cares you, you are just tools for profit, avoid this company! None Low pay Management is Terrible in OKC If I could have given a negative rating to the management at CACI I would have. They micromanage, treat you like a child and have terrible double standards. This is a great place to work if you like you brown nose instead of do your job. Imagine the worst place you have ever worked this is more than likely worse. Good Benefits To many to list them all The work is important Clients would agree to a workplan and when the team arrived on site the managers would change the plan. Then they blamed the facilitator for not achieving the objectives. working in a cubicle Overall it wasnt bad when I worked for them. The group I worked with was a good team. It was a demanding job, but you had to learn how to prioritize your work to ensure it was done on time. You did have those investigator that did not like feedback, when they did not have enough information in their reports. Toxic Work Enviroment CACI, Fayetteville NC is a very toxic work environment that host a plethora of clicks and internal relationships up to the Program Manager. Inappropriate language and jokes are made by members of the Management and disciplined by the management to employees. Junior Managers are allowed to disrespect other department employees and managers with no action taken. Senior Managers are discouraged to make corrective action to employees for failure to properly conduct their jobs. Yet same employees are allowed to complain to Program Manager for very reason being corrected for and the managers are nearly always told to back down. Every day from multiple departments within are complaints to HR. The most I have seen in a very long career. Never have I seen such a toxic Program which gives a real bad name for CACI which in general is a great company. Corporates unfortunately is blind to what is really happening with this program in Fayetteville NC. Will work you to death CACI in the beginning will start you with a low salary as a Investigator I and tell you it’s really simple to get to Investigator II which will be a huge difference in salary. Basically, they put a carrot in front of you to chase. The only problem is you will have to put in huge amounts of time to be promoted to Investigator II. Logically CACI understands if you are learning the job it would take well over a year to become productive enough to work at the Investigator II level unless you work extra to learn the job but only bill them for 40 hours. They know anyone who produces enough work to be promoted to Investigator II did so with a ton of time being worked and not reported. Before, I started with CACI I read reviews that said the same thing but I discounted them. You have the option to do the same. Work from home, good place to improve your skills because CACI expects perfection in the work you submit. Long hour to increase your pay. Sorry management The management does not care about its people at all. I worked overseas and management lead by threats of termination, “you can and will be replaced “ None Stay away Good place to work. My direct manager was horrible It's one of those situations where the company as a whole is good, but if your direct manager sucks, then it makes the job suck. It just isn't good for me based on my experience thus far. The workplace culture is good. The hardest part of the job is the managers not listening to your recommendations when you have had more experience with the exact scenario that they are going through. Pay, work schedule, benefits, mission Lower level management Great company, poor decisions Was a great company until they decided to roll over make it mandatory for everyone to be vaccinated. I wonder how many people will be left when the deadline rolls around. Good luck. Interesting. Management was helpful when assistance was needed Overall, a good company to work for. Co-workers were helpful and accommodating for leave coverage. With contract work, job security is always questionable. Nice place to work This is a great company to work for, benefits are great in terms of medical and time-off. Management has been great, its easy to advance to other areas. They have a virtual university where you can take courses for free. 8 4 Thank you for your review! We are incredibly proud of what we have accomplished in terms of continuous learning via our Virtual University and Communities of Practice! Productive workplace Good coworkers and middle management who cared. Workers allowed to work at his or her own pace to a large degree. Collateral duties were assigned with a rotating schedule that amicable to all employees. Free holiday meals and caring middle management Upper management did not really care about the actual workers. 1 Great company to work for, plenty of room for advancement. I enjoy working for CACI. Its a great company with great benefits. The option for training or professional development is always available. The only issue is job security, so you have to stay on the lookout for future positions. 1 Enjoyable workplace contributing to important work Manager and benefits were great, and the work culture was very enjoyable. Colleagues were always willing to help and has a very casual environment with important work. I just wish the job was more of what I wanted to do, which is the only reason I left. Experience solely dependent on your business unit As a company, it’s not too bad here, but your experience is almost exclusively dependent on your business group. Some business groups have experienced layoffs due to budget issues, while others are operating fluidly. Flex time, WFH options for indirect work Disagreements with technical teams through executive levels Poor - Wouldn't recommend to anyone. General worker bee's are usually great people, personally. Mid-Management is generally clueless with a severe lack of understanding of the work being done. This often leads to the recruitment of unqualified people on the contract. I don't think i need to explain further complications that that creates. Paid Vacation Too many to list. Flexibility, good management, great benefits If they had not have lost the contract I would still be with Caci. Did not want to work with the company that won the contract. Will try to find another position with Caci in the very near future. Flexibility, good management, great benefits None Not what I imagined I wanted to work for CACI for quite some time, however, I was quite disappointed with my experience. My client is amazing and always recognizes my work and effort...if I could just be recognized by my own company, that would be nice! Annual pay increases are quite insulting, benefits are a little less than average, and work culture is bland. I know some have amazing experiences with this company, I believe my experience was tarnished by a supervisor who doesn't advocate, motivate, or recognize employees. Large company stability with niche group vibe Large company stability with a niche group vibe. Really enjoy the opportunity to be able to telecommute. Lots of room for advancement, you just have to make sure that you are having conversations about how you want to grow with your manager via touchpoints session and also keep an eye on new opportunities that match your interests! CACI's Virtual University and Communities of Practice are great and can help you further master your craft. I feel valued by my team and my supervisors. I feel that am heard and that my ideas are taken into account. Excellent work/life balance; Good Compensation; Not being micromanaged. Change management can be difficult given the numerous teams you work with on a daily basis, but you have to just make sure you're communicating with the proper individuals and all works out! Flexible, overall good needs some work still Flexible and great work/life balance. Have had the flexibility to work from home during the pandemic. Company seems good as a whole, only issue is with the program I am in. I don't feel it was bid correctly and because of it many people got laid of during the first year. Raise % is between 1-3% a year, which is lower than some of the other large companies. Work from home lack of job security, could depend on the program you are in Minimum pay and Boring job. This job pays the minimum for the position and the work for me is boring. The managers work hard and many employees don’t because of the lack of work. There is little room for growth or advancement. Everything seems to be at a turtle pace with no real sense of urgency. If you want a boring job but with consistent pay, this is the place to be. Good benefits Boring, no advancement It's a job I enjoy CACI overall, good place to work. Limited advancement chances as CACI hires per contract, which makes advancement hard. Flexible work hours as long as you complete your work no one cares what you work. Flexible work hours as long as you get your job/task completed. Limited advancement opportunities Many hardworking and smart employees After being hired, I ended up working onsite in a government office. I rarely saw my CACI manager and coworkers. I felt isolated and my government manager did not seem to know what she wanted me to work on. I was moved around from project to project. Government priorities seemed to change frequently. Projects and task forces were set up and then disbanded after a few months. The experience was frustrating and left me feeling like I had nothing to show for my time working for CACI. I also felt abandoned by my CACI manager as she was unwilling to take any steps to improve my situation. Good salary and benefits Lack of management support Great workplace with free coffee Overall this company is very good. I've been working at the division in Sterling. Even after the acquisition we have kept good benefits and pay. I really like the free coffee and soda. Career advancement is possible and most managers are decent. Coffee Steady work The work is steady and the compensation is fair. No upward mobility if you are not a veteran or military spouse. The company doesn't provide extra training. Work life balance Poor management Do not waste your time here. There are no technical skills here that would transfer to other jobs. Large disconnect between management and developers. Absolutely no agile practices implemented here unless you consider a paragraph weekly check in “agile”. Assignments are given and you would spend the next few days talking with other developers asking if it was doable in the first place or worth the time. Assignments were sometimes late and you would spend time doing nothing. Management plays favorites with the developers. New contracts are rarely pursued. High turnover rate with junior developers. Extremely poor salary compared to other companies in the area. No relocation assistance. Hardly any room for advancement, raises or bonuses. Do yourself a favor and do not work at this location unless it’s a last resort. Cool developers despite the work. Poor technologies, poor management, no any room for advancement, technical skills would be useless at other companies. Large company stability with niche group vibe Large company stability with a niche group vibe. Really enjoy the opportunity to be able to telecommute.

Change management can be difficult given the numerous teams you work with on a daily basis, but you have to just make sure you're communicating with the proper individuals and all works out! High stress and high burnout Government contracts are driven to impress the customer and employees be damned. You are a body and can and will be replaced at will. Compensation and rewards are for government expect a pat on the back at most from your parent company. You are at the whims of whomever you get as a government boss, good luck. Decent pay Subject to wim of contract productive and fun work with team Flex hours. Good benefits. Sense of purpose. Great teamwork and always learning new things. Work on government contracts. Manager always kept in touch with weekly meetings. Good benefits and flex time None to think of. Great colleagues and supportive environment Colleagues were great! Overall enjoyable experience. Benefits were great and management was extremely helpful in getting started. It can get pretty stressful, but management provides a good support system . Good benefits none Good place to transition after the military Immediately after I retired I started working with CACI. My position is unique, I fall under a different organization so my interactions with my own company are fewer than my teams. When my company thought they would loose the contract they underbid and everyone had to take a pay cut or leave which is sad because they have amazing people working for them. Definitely underpaid in comparison to what other companies pay. Our crew travels A-LOT for our specific contracts and it takes a toll. Not really a lot of room to grow, people definitely use this job as a stepping stone. I cannot complain about management, grateful for the opportunity to gain all the experience and knowledge from this job. Gain a lot of knowledge Pay Nice place to work This is a great company to work for, benefits are great in terms of medical and time-off. Management has been great, its easy to advance to other areas. They have a virtual university where you can take courses for free. 8 4 Thank you for your review! We are incredibly proud of what we have accomplished in terms of continuous learning via our Virtual University and Communities of Practice! Large Company Felt like contract work and once the contract was ending, I felt like I would be unemployed. A unique situation so not much contact with direct report which is probably why. 1 great learning opportunity With a contract culture there are ups and downs, but the opportunity is there to better one's self and as with anything it is what you make it. If your search is for a challenge it is worth the effort to try it out. Thank you for your review. Please do not hesitate to let us know if there is anything else we can do to make CACI an even better place to work! They pay you well My experience with the organization started well but after an unexpected illness not so good. Had to jump my chain of command for a doctor ordered request. Unfortunately the management for my team was not the easiest person to talk to work related or personal issues that could affect you in the workplace and your job performance. Compensation, flexibility Management Creative designer have some leeway. Customer driven work at customer site. Limited growth, limited training, high stress and burn out rate as if 2019. May have improved since then. Culture is driven by customer influence. Camaraderie among the designers. Always under the gaze of the customer. Okay Background Investigator position was super stressful. The expectations change day to day, and the amount of work they want you to produce is insane. You get the same amount of credit whether you write a one paragraph report or a 30-page report. It's exhausting. The local travel and meeting new people, which made the job interesting, are gone now due to COVID. Hours have been cut, so a lot of people have quit. They won't lay anyone off, because they don't want to pay unemployment. Work independently Unstable hours, too much/too little work, expectations vary day to day Amazing corporate culture CACI knows how to bring the right people in for the job. My Team is made up of some heavy hitters from the ""industry"" and its nice to FINALLY be working with a Crew that just ""gets it!"", after multiple contracts with a lot of BS people and culture...... Worst job I ever had Micromanagement and I fortunately discrimination in the billing and program control department. Managers who would put you down in order for them to climb. Toxic work environment. I do not recommend to go work there unless you know who you’re going to work for. Promotional potential for people who’s English is their second language next to zero. Favoritism for the guys that have been there the longest Interesting work, terrible management. No diversity. Poorly managed. Strong Agile practiced here which made development easy, but the ol' boy network still exists, and there is definite favoritism. flexible schedules ya get no respect Great Contracting Company A typical day was mainly interacting with the customer not CACI. I loved this job because this role was project based. You get two weeks to complete your assignment and can ask as many questions as you need. CACI has been the best contracting company I have worked for. They really made sure everyone was financially ok during the beginning of the pandemic. I left because the customer offered me a permanent position. One negative: I had a high strung manager who made things more difficult then they should have been. Pay, Job Placement, Great People Management on specific contracts Great job, but very stressful and unstable I love my job. I love my manager. This job will have you pulling out your hair. One day a statement in a report is good, the next, it is not, and depending on the person reviewing your work, it may or may not be right. The ""just do it and get it over with"" attitude is aggravating to no end. Nobody learns that way and it causes a gap between the two teams. This job is VERY unstable. One month, we are on unlimited overtime and getting so much work it is hard to keep up, and then the next, as a full time employee, you get enough work for 25 hours a week. The pay is great, and if you work REALLY fast and then basically don't work, your metrics are in the green and then maybe you can get a promotion. This is definitely a job that you need a side gig or another part time job to do. pay, benefits, management unstable, unclear work a good place to start This was a good entry-level job for people coming right out of college and getting their feet wet. However, the work was repetitive and upper level management was very out of touch. opportunities for advancement, paid time off repetitive work, poor management Great place to work simply! Great place to work simply! Managers are helpful compensation is great! I could not ask more. I recommend CACI to anyone with great talent to be a part of Everything Nothing Meaningful work. Working with CACI was one of my first jobs with a non governmental company. I learned rather quick what a difference it was not to be a government employees. Such as management is much stricter on your work hours. Hiring bonus for your recommendations Parking. Average large corporation Company is about what you would expect for a large company. Very flexible company for hours. Only complaint is even as a prime usually salaries seem to be 10 to 20 percent less than certain comparable companies. No real direct path for advancement but plenty of contract options to move tom Flexibility, deployments Salary, advancement Important Missions Overall I enjoyed working at CACI. The program I was on was newly awarded so a lot of details were needed to be addressed however, leadership was supportive Great Company Great company. They give you a lot of independence. Not for you if you dont' have good time management. Only work here if you are a hard worker. I highly recommend working here. Flexible time None Terrible Job CACI has designed their productivity metrics to get their Investigators to work unpaid overtime. Tasks easily take twice as long to complete than the time they give you, so you'll end up working off the clock just to meet production goals. They are aware of this and do not care. Great Benefits They overwork their employees. Great place to work. The company is truly dedicated to hiring the very best people. If you work there, don't leave. If you are trying to land a job with them, just keep at it, it is well worth the effort. Management, supportive and encouraging to employees Previous employer It was ok. Based on my previous experience, the pay was not sufficient. The culture at work could've been better. Expected more transitioning out of the military. Stress free workplace with good coworkers In comparison to the new contractor that took over, CACI was great. However, while I was employed by CACI, my length of service did not reflect well on their pay raises. This job did allow for family time and allowed me to take leave whenever I wanted to. Stress free great hours Little advancement opportunity"

Nelnet|" Calm Work Environment I enjoy my time at Nelnet. The work is not always the most riveting, but my boss is really nice and the flexibility is great to have as a college student. Poverty wages I started work as in-bound advisor 1 at the end of November. It’s work from home and I took the job at such a low wage because I have years of call center experience (w@h and in office). I barely made it for the 6 months they require before you can move to another position. The cold, hard facts are the phone jobs are the highest wages you’re going to make unless you’re corporate. Even the people who make significant changes by hand to accounts are paid less than $14/hr. If you don’t take ANY medical or dental insurance you’ll make around $18/nr, but that fluctuates. The upside is that you’ll deal with the nicest callers! I would have stayed with them a lot longer if they paid a living wage, but NN really doesn’t care about their employees. They’ll do anything for the borrowers, but nothing for employees. I actually was sad to leave because I honestly liked the job and the job security, but I couldn’t afford to work there any longer. I could go into more about how out of touch corporate is, but I’ll leave it at this. Good job, good job security, but you’ll have to live in utter poverty unless you have a spouse making a lot more money than you do. Great for retired people or anyone else who doesn’t have to pay rent and support a household. Nice callers, job security Terrible wages Stressful This job stressed me out . My hair was literally falling out EVERYDAY ! The starting pay was 16.50 but needs to be 25. It’s so much that comes with this job . The only thing that is great is working from home . I knew I wouldn’t be a good fit when someone said I’ve been here for 5 months and still don’t know what I’m doing .. Remote Everything except remote Work from home Great company to work for supervisor is great and team leads very helpful willing to work with you if you need help or have emergency where you need to leave Best remote job yet Aa long as you retain your training and can adapt well to changes you can thrive here. Super welcoming. Hard to fail If you communicate with your team. Great place to work I worked in the TPD call center for a year and honestly, it wasn't the best. It was high stress and overall I'd give it a 1 star. I then transferred to Enrollment Processing and I loved everything about that job. Fun and helpful All trainers and supervisors are super nice and helpful. Hours are good as well as pay rate is great. Would recommend for anyone who wants to work remote. Easy and good job I liked this job a lot, but at the time it was Covid forbearance and it was a lot of just waiting for the phones to ring. It was a good job but I didn’t like the late hours. I did enjoy being at home I just wish I had been healthy enough to stay on. Overall, the company is really attentive to your needs and makes sure you have the trainings you need to do the job. Micromanage & bully work environment Only boot lickers & brown nosers advance here. They have a high turn over rate for a reason. They are understaffed & underpaid. Constant overtime. Bosses like to talk about their brand new car they bought at the beginning of every year. You are just a number. If something happens to your health or you die… they do not care. They only care that it inconveniences them. Oh yea, lots of pizza parties. Generic pizza & pop & ice cream Everything Soul crushing Incredibly soul crushing work. Constant micromanaging and being screamed at by customers. Raises based on computer systems that don’t work, extreme tech difficulties and when you reach out to leadership that claim they never received any communication from you. Very poor onboarding classes, you will not be confident when you start taking calls. Unclear rules and quality department constantly makes mistakes and spreads incorrect info but it doesn’t matter if you point out quality was incorrect and you were right becuase it will not be adjusted on your score card, it will still be shown as a negative mark. Very limited room for career growth becuase they hire so many people all the time. Too manager focused It's hard to leave an accurate review for such a large company with tons of different divisions. But across the board it seems there's a big focus on manager culture and the art of management, which obviously leads to some serious micromanagement. Starting pay is competitive though raises aren't (that seems to be the norm everywhere now though). Benefits are kind of a mixed bag. Some are good such as 401k matching and student loan repayment assistance, and some are really bad, such as the health insurance. At least in my division they're very flexible with remote work which is very nice. In all it's a great place for a steady corporate job. Maybe not so much though if you're introverted like me and need some breathing room away from the army of managers Good and bad A good manager will make whatever position you have positive, and enjoyable. The company culture is fairly welcoming and encouraging. However that can sometimes lead you to feeling like you're stuck in a never ending freshman orientation. Friendly people, good benefits. Unreasonable expectations Very generous benefits They love spoiling their employees. Generous time off, bonuses multiple times through out the year, perks for being healthy. Some calls could get a little complex but there was always someone willing to offer help. Which helped make the remote work a little less lonely. Training was 6 weeks and the information was flowing constantly with a final at the end. Depends Nelnet is a good stepping stone for a career . Their pto is generous. They're patient and help you learn and grow . Depending on the department you get promoted to . They will suggest special projects without incentive . Over worked and under paid where other companies have multiple different departments this company has most rolled into one roll .from mandatory outbound calls in a system that lags so bad every 3 calls regardless of internet speed and cleared cache ( worked in office ) the micromanagment when their systems lag . When employees who are mostly happy to do their jobs start complaining about the outbound system because it's frustrating for the customers and us , we received an email from leadership saying ""we are lucky to have our jobs "" it's 2022 ........ The culture can be great , but when they hire supervisors off the street and don't have them on the phones long they develop a complex and the employees are underminded . You are overworked and underpaid . Once you receive a promotion you won't get an annual salary increase since the couch change promotions( .50 cents for being cross trained ) apparently means you're rolling in the dough . The positives are you work and come across some great people , patient people . They do give you room to learn . As for promotions if you want to be demoted and you're good at your job they ignore you and set up a meeting to tell you how good you're doing.... Recently they've been promoting people that don't have enough basic knowledge for their positions . They're promoting to promote . Nelnet has somehow lost their purpose Helping, pto We are just a number in their "" right sizing "" Great management and training staff I only have been with Nelnet since Aug 15 2022 as of the date of this review, however I have enjoyed my training working with the teams and so far have had a fun experience. The leads and trainers always make sure to answer your questions and make sure you're prepared for your doing your job. Great teams and culture, good pay and benefits, very helpful trainers and supervisors. No cons with the company, the only things that's frustrating is getting past government clearance to do this job. It’s great & sometimes stressful. Honestly I love my job and much more that we work from home. I wish the time could be a little more flexible as far as like pick up my kiddo from school come back type of thing. Also I love that they care about our mental health since callers can be jerks and they pay for our gym or stress relief things like a massage. I’ve built my mini gym solely on getting a machine per year that is below their amount they give. My sup is pretty great when I said I was applying for another department and they all wished me good luck and everything. Work from home, refunded for gym use. Short breaks, eto onoy if you saved it up. I like my job. You have opportunity for growth Nelnet offers a lot of opportunities for growth. The training is pretty easy. The real work is on the floor. Every possible scenario you will be dealing with. Im hands on training was a challenge. Most of my knowledge was learned after training. Very good company but, don't get too attached The company is very good. The trainers were very helpful in 7 weeks of training and were with the trainees every step of the way. Nesting was enjoyable and managers never made you feel like you were alone. I will say if they do have a slow period they may fire you if your metrics are not good. Great place to work Great place to work and grow. Very friendly people, loving, caring, and understanding. Very diversity. You want a great work environment to grow, then Nelnet is a place to be Data Entry Specialist “This is a great company to work for. I am pleased that they have high standards for their employees to go by. “Just a reminder that I LOVE THIS COMPANY. THANKS FOR LETTING ME WORK FOR U!!!!!!!!!!! YOU ARE AWSOME.” good Good company bad leadership This is a good company in Lincoln and gives many people jobs but leadership and management is not on the same page ever. Hard to advance unless you use politics. Calm Work Environment I enjoy my time at Nelnet. The work is not always the most riveting, but my boss is really nice and the flexibility is great to have as a college student. Excellent company led by executives with strong ethical standards You want to work for Nelnet! Management is great, from team leads to top execs. It's a business, it exists to make money, but *not* at any cost -- real time, attention and resources are poured into assuring the well-being of the employees. Great pay but they do not care about employees The pay is great it is hard to get a shift bid if you don’t personally know any higher ups. Supposedly is performance based but ha done of the highest scores in the company but was let go due to CARES ACT 4 4 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Work environment What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Busy work What is the work environment and culture like at the company? They care about employees and customers and the office is pretty relaxed What is a typical day like for you at the company? Imaging computers, shipping hardware, retiring old hardware Pretty Decent Do not come in on a contract you can be dropped at the drop of a dime. Overall decent besides the call flow! And reading people’s minds. Still a good stepping stone. Flexibility, home and work balance Pay, borrowers Management is very helpful Working here for almost a year, management is very helpful, they understand we as employees have a life outside of work. Pay is ok. Very Repetitive work. 2 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Decent wage and possibilities for advancement What is the most stressful part about working at the company? being the punching bag of customers who are irritated about costs What is the work environment and culture like at the company? it seems open at fisrt then the ""click"" culture comes to light What is a typical day like for you at the company? lots of phone call and sitting Great place to work! The benefits are amazing. One of the best places I've ever worked! Call centers are generally tedious to work at, but it was above the norm at Nelnet. Outstanding benefits Call center Stressful awful pay Raises are little to nothing promotions are handed out like candy to people that don't know what their doing micromanaging has been put unto place because of that. Super stressful work environment higher ups believe throwing a free lunch or a small bonus is equivalent to a competitive pay rate. Health Insurance Dental and Vision Pay is horrible raises are little to nothing even bonus is very little Management communications lack You will be teaching yourself a lot of skills, as the managers will know less than the actual workers. I do not know the reason or benefit of this. If you call help desk, help desk will shrug their shoulders and you will be back to juat helping yourself, which causes miscommunication between reps and customers. Work from home Teaching yourself everything, never getting any answers, managers leaving you on read for days and avoiding answering questions management was vey childish No work balance at all in this place, management was very childish, absolutely no room for advancement. The pay is very low and its not worth your mental health I know this company can do better, but work needed done still. The coworkers are fun and the environment energizing. The supervisors are great. Company pay is low and possibility for advancement not easy to obtain. They don't look at advancing you at all if you are over 50. Company has high expectations. They do work with you to get you up to speed, and it is hard to fail if you really are trying. For what the competition is to the job I would say stress is something could be done more to release the stress by helping with pay and looking at advancing those who ask. They do offer before COVID fun events but not anymore. Data entry work Strong standards which I appreciate. But solely did data entry and the requirements were a bit unrealistic. Benefits were almost worth it. But if being a robot for a giant corporation is your cup of tea then it’s prefect for your. Not what I expected I wouldn’t even suggest a dog to work here literally . They managers don’t help they don’t know anything and there very unprofessional.I wouldn’t dare go back Great Place for short period Private student loan side. Benefits are the best I have had, its the reason i have stayed so long. Quarterly HSA paid by the company. Can move positions in 6 months, pay doesn't change with position change. Quarterly bonuses based on performance. Upto 3% merit raise. Benefits, Eto. Pay Not worth it You are underpaid to do everyone’s job and the jon it’s self is really hard and they should pay more than what they offer. No one is ever on the same page. I wouldn’t recommend Decent Okay great benefits they could give more due to the needed line of work but it's okay for now. Trying to explore more avenues in hopes of sticking to this company longer. Benefits None Decent place to work. Great job security. Advancement somewhat questionable. Worked here for 6.5 years. Started at 12.50/hr and left at 19.56/hr. Company culture was excellent. Some of the work was arbitrary during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the student loan freeze. We were forced to contact customers for no apparent reason because we had nothing else to do. This made for some very unpleasant customer interactions. Besides this part, it's a great place to work if you can handle the emotional labor involved with talking with customers all day regarding financial issues. (This part can be stressful but has nothing to do with the company, it's just the nature of the job). Small advancements can happen consistently but if you want to be promoted to a supervisor or salaried position, they don't become available too often. Horrible job Don’t do it. Horrible job ever, don’t pay good, will make up lies just to fire you because they hired too many people and don’t have work for anyone. Fruad job Great Culture A company that truly cares about their help and I believe that they want the best for their employees. You learn a lot and the work is challenging. Knowing software and computer skills can help in your responsibilities adequate training and good management I was a contracted remote contact tracer. The contract ended early with little notice. The work was rewarding for the most part. The management was kind and professional. Calm Work Environment I enjoy my time at Nelnet. The work is not always the most riveting, but my boss is really nice and the flexibility is great to have as a college student. Decent starter wfh job Great benefits and the company actually cares if you succeed. Low pay and horrible schedule starting out but if you stay long enough there are shift bids. Good pay and good management I love my job and the staff I work with. They really take care of their employees. I loved the training class with Lloyd Sparks but the bubble was over packed with trainees Pay, management Training over packed 1 I enjoy working here Great place to work, excellent benefits and work/life balance. Have recommended to others. Pay is good for what it is. Love the flexibility and working remote. Productiveness loved it Great wish they would hire me again they were Awesome they will you take care of their employees and recognize us the pay was great and the managers really care about you Great except for pay If you don’t need the money Nelnet is a great place to work at. I love my supervisor and it’s a good company with good benefits. But you will be severely underpaid and raises are random at best. Good management Good management but the calls were stressful. Everyone who worked there was nice and friendly. Definitely a stressful environment though due the calls. DIY AKA Teach Yourself job Between working manual outbound assisting customers with back to back calls, background check nonsense that requires the most tedious of info! * I’ve been going back and forth with it since I was hired 4 months ago * poor training ! You don’t learn until you actually take a call and even then you have zero help, so many tasks to keep up with. Between getting negative points from calls you made mistakes on and having to find time to correct them while also taking calls, background check bs, being micro managed, threatened to lose job from mistakes THEY made smh and a terrible work shift of 12-9 Monday - Friday & dealing with customers when you barely know what you’re doing smh do not work here unless you are used to a demanding computer job that pays crumbs compared to the work that you actually put in. Do not recommend at all. Stressful and not enough quality training The hiring process should have clued me in to the disorganization of this company. Training for an advisor role lasts about a month and a half but there is so little useful information given during training and you are then thrown on the phones without even listening in on live phone calls. They say it is because most agents are remote they do not have that capability which is laughable. People Services is almost impossible to get ahold of and when you do they are unable to answer your questions. The EQUIP process was an absolute mess. The job deserves higher pay for the amount of stress, knowledge, and volume of calls you have to deal with. They have high turnover because of the complexity of the role and lack of resources and support for when you are thrown to the wolves after subpar training and “bubble”. Very rude supervisors and abysmal communication. Paid insurance for first year, eto and benefits from day one Short breaks, typical call center atmosphere even when working remotely, average pay, vto after training, horrible communication It is work from home. They haven't laid us off during Covid. This company sees you as a minion. You are just filling a space. For being such a large company they have horrible insurance rates. Regarding student loans, they don't care about making changes. They don't update employees and things change every single day. Management doesn't know what employees are doing. They can't do the same job yet they are in charge. Pretty decent pay Management is awful and doesn't care about you. Training is a joke. Really no advancement opportunities…To many roles not enough compensation and very low bonuses I have been at this company almost 3 years and have not been able to advance to other opportunities but have been trained to work multiple roles without a pay increase. Really feels like the company does not care about its employees. Great pay & benefits with lots of room for advancement. A company that truly cares how they impact this world, their neighborhood, & employees. Nelnet was a wonderful place to work for…if you can get through their grueling onboarding process. Even someone like me who has a zero interesting, very boring background was frustrated at the process. But it was worth it. Even though they’re a larger company I feel like Nelnet really cared about helping out their local community and overall cared about the employees…even if they didn’t know you personally. Only negative or downside I would comment about was the training process. The ladies who provided the training were great but they throw a TON of information at you in speeds I couldn’t keep up with. Unfortunately my daughters daycare shut down on my second day of training due to covid and I had to miss work here and there. I was playing “catch up” the rest of the training but was always swimming in a sea of confusion. And doing any type of catching up off the clock was a was a huge no no. I felt like it was easy for me to to get lost in the shuffle, like I was just another number. Pay, benefits, equipment provided Grueling onboarding process, lots & lots of information being thrown at you. Remote- Just started Advisor I, company seems to have a low turnover rate. Not much diversity in the supervisory team that I saw. They claim you can advance within the company. 30 min lunch They is a great company but the pay is not the best. Working there was a breeze but the pay is not worth it or can you live off the pay. The training is done great where you should how to do everything which is easy. Great place to work. The managers were really helpful if I had any questions. Also the coworkers were really helpful as well. I found the job task wasn't too hard to do. Unfortunately it was a contract position. Very nice facility, but you're never there beyond your shift, trapped at your cubicle Good consistent work with lots to learn. It's pretty easy once you learn it and they give you tons of resources to make the calls as easy as possible. Working for nelnet Honestly the job was horrible, management didn’t care how to work with you. Communication as poor, and training was worthless. No one cared about your personal life, no one trained you properly. You had no idea what you were doing 80% of the day. They made it seem like such an exciting job, and all my coworkers wanted to leave this company. It’s not worth the pain and misery to work for this company that will never care about you. Communication. Training is exhausting and mentally draining I have been training for four weeks and the training is physically and mentally exhausting! You have do much material to consume that it makes your head hurt! Sitting in front of a computer with only 2 fifteen minute breaks and one 30 minute lunch break is unfair. Supervisors don’t respond to employees immediately when they are needed. Also, hourly pay is not enough for all the tasks they want you to do during and after training. None Short breaks, too much material to consume, not enough pay for the extensive amount of work, Long hours Innovative You will learn a lot. Must be willing to go outside of your comfort zone, but it is a wonderful place to work. Fun and engaging. They really teach you a lot that you can use in other fields. Schedules, emphasis on family Great benefits I love the company honestly. I’m currently getting ready to embark on nesting. The training is amazing. You get to learn at your own pace and it’s a judgement free zone. You qualify for employee benefits on day one. Health, holiday pay, vacation, etc on DAY ONE!!! The pay is good. It varies based on your role and the hours are amazing no weekends with varying shifts during the week. Peak season stays open as late as 12 est but regular business hours are 8pm est. Solid place to work if you enjoy talking to a lot of clients. Management was good and bad depending on person. Solid place to work if you enjoy talking to a lot of clients. Management was good and bad depending on person. Work culture is decent with some advancements possible. Calm Work Environment I enjoy my time at Nelnet. The work is not always the most riveting, but my boss is really nice and the flexibility is great to have as a college student. Excellent It's a great place to work. The managers are great, the culture itself is great, they had 0 layoffs during the pandemic and were able to move everyone to remote successfully. Great benefits They do offer affordable benefits. But if you are an advisor expect to be confused during training. They lack organization while you are being trained. I was shifted back and forth with no explanation and no answers when I asked. Most people do want to help but they also constantly me tion Quality as a way to keep you on your toes. Good benefits Stressful, a lot of information to kearn in a short time. 2 Everybody is willing to help when help is needed I like the company and the benefits are awesome! I think they threw us on phones kinda quick but I'm sure it's going to all come together! Some of the trainers are great, others not so much. It's like they know you're new to this but still give you a hard time Benefits Short breaks Great place to get started Been here since my internship. It's been a great learning experience. I'm part of a smaller dev team and I feel involved in what we do, even though I am a remote associate. I'm able to speak my mind and feel my direct supervisor listens to me. Growth, Understanding company, Fair PTO/wages/benefits Unorganized at times, willing to listen but don't see much action being taken No advancement opportunities, bad pay, cheap insurance Insurance is cheap which is great but the pay is terrible for what you put up with. Back to back calls and most customers are so rude and spiteful. No advancement options because there’s so many people on each team. Free lunches, cheap insurance Pay, advancement Excellent benefits It's an ok company to work for. I have learn so much about federal loans etc. The hardest part of the job is the mandatory overtime. The pros are you get personal time off in which is much needed because of the long hours and mandatory OT. Great Benefits Mandatory Overtime and long hours Flexibile Work Environment Nelnet is very flexible with work environments for most departments. It's easy to request time off when needed. There are quarters of the year that are extremely busy so on the off season, it's more flexible. Advancement opportunities are ok, but there are many divisions to look at for advancement. Benefits are amazing. Flexibility, Benefits, wellness program Work-life balance, extreme amount of meetings Overall pretty solid place to work Job security, career advancement for those who are self motivated. Decent pay and raise opportunities. Quarter bonuses based on how well you do your job. Good benefits and earned time off. Benefits, pay, career advancement Depending on where you are, work can be draining, mandatory overtime can kill work/life balance. There is a reason why pto is great To make you ignore the other aspects of working there. They micromanage and only care about their numbers. No soul in this place. No compensation in this place. No kindness in this place. Great work life balance My position had a great worklife balance and flexible schedule. Was enjoyable being at work. Overtime was rarely required. Quiet environment and entire team was nice. Free fruit on Tuesday, flex schedule, M-f Pay could be better, at time I worked there working from home wasn't an option Great place great place to work, terrific benefits that are unmatched, strong push to advance individuals within the company, or provide career skills to go elsewhere Unremarkable Nothing special to say. It is just a job and no path for much growth or advancement. There is favoritism among management. Good place to get some experience for your resume but not much more. Fun work environment I love this job. An would refer it as well. There's a lot of chance for advancement a lot of perks the word for Nelnet it's very customer-oriented and driven and I like that a lot 401k profit sharing and other great 12 hour shifts and the Baylor program you have to work weekends Great place to work I had a really good experience especially with my supervisor who was accommodating, respectful and kind at all times. I enjoyed the work and would recommend this job overall. Excellent supervisor, competitions for free lunches and other perks Don't do it! Terrible! Work from home is not a good experience. The first 3.5 weeks of training had so many tech issues and not enough time to cover everything. 2nd 3.5 in the bubble was worse! No support from management or trainers. Dumped you on the phones and made to figure it out. If you have planned days off, make sure you get approval in writing before accepting the job because they will backtrack on that real quick! Not a good place to work at all, very stressful, and has no guidance. Nelnet culture Great place to work. Everyone can get along fairly. We try to provide a culture within the company and some do a great job at feeling like we belong and that we are family. Benefits are good. Advancement. Takes some time but it’s more like networking to get to where you want to be. Not a bad thing but there will be times where someone will win a position but there are other candidates that are highly more qualified. Benefits and the people Good pay until they added more work for same pay The place was a good entry level job. Pay was great until they decided to add task and not compensate for pay. No way to make more money unless you advance. friendly staff, lunch room. pay Good not great Everyone is so nice. Company is super flexible with employees who have families. It is super busy and constant emails and calls. If you don’t handle stress well you may want to look elsewhere. The culture is really good and as a whole the company is very relaxed. Cool job Decent not the very best. With every job it can be a challenge. Do what you can and what you cant is not to be discussed. Be you and enjoy the ride. Smile Na Na Oh my… The management here is absolute trash. If you have any type of leave of absence they make you feel like garbage. I had surgery and extended it a few days and my manager threatened my job No work life balance. Management Calm Work Environment I enjoy my time at Nelnet. The work is not always the most riveting, but my boss is really nice and the flexibility is great to have as a college student. Generally a good job!! This might be the best job I’ve had. While the call center life isn’t an easy one, I like my coworkers, I am paid fairly well for what I do, and they give ample vacation which is super nice!! Customers can be pretty ruthless which is what I like least about my job I’d say! Vacation, pay, coworkers Extremely fast paced, stressful 1 OK place to wotk Good starter job, but not many opportunities for advancement. Great co-workers. Management doesnt value the great employees but rewards the underacheivers. Pay, no work /life balance 2 1 Poor poor poor Stay away if you can.favortism, back to back calls and micro management is rampant. There is drama and childish antics among coworkers. Pay is decent so are benefits. Rest is toxic Good pay All the rest You are just a body in seat No one really cares About you at Nelnet. You are merely just a body in a seat. And they need all the bodies in the seats in order to meet their quota. Horrible communication I have never been so confused with a company before, how they handle communications within each other is minimal. You will always be blamed, no accountability at all from your leadership. I was a specialist which would have to deal with escalated calls that ask for managers, pay is not great to be doing work of a manager and not having the ability to help them and not having anyone to support you with those type of calls you are on your own. QA is constantly on you regardless of how well you are doing they will find the smallest things to take off points for, which mainly are due to miscommunication and misguided training. No one knows what they are doing, you literally wing it everyday. The amount of stress from this job is through the roof call volume is never ending, not even 1 second in between calls. You’ll never have the chance to work on your follow ups or check on your applications/forms you sent. And when you do they always get rejected.. no communication at all between anyone. It was a waste of time.. I quit over a month ago and returned my equipment that same day I quit and still am getting emails over missing equipment that I personally submitted a “IT ticket” personally handed off equipment to an IT agent and was told I was good yet still received threatening emails, due to miscommunication within their teams. Don’t bother with these people. Benefits, work from home Short breaks, late breaks, lack of communication, support and accountability, no proper training Great company but flexibility is key working here I've worked here for about a year. Great trainers and management, some are micromanagement, Def all about stats, great benefits too. You can easily get new skills if you ask for it and get involved in other areas. But most of the time you have to have good stats. My only complaint is because of the hours you really don't have time to plan for doctors but they allow you to bring a doctor's note for excused absence but anything personal good luck. My other complaint is flexibility is really key here which I don't have problem with but I've been on three different projects since covid hit you don't get really any raise for that they just expect you to adapt and be okay with it. Also some of us work from home permanently so internet compinsation would be nice. They don't seperate your ETO from sick days, you get alloted 12 call ins but excused if you bring a doctor's note. But if you don't have ETO you won't get paid for that day. They offer long term and short term disability and FMLA a year after employment FYI 4 floating holidays, 120 hours ETO yearly tuition reimbursement, 401k Short lunch, hours are rough Bad company They only care about getting their numbers and if you're trying your best, they simply don't care. Out the door with ya. They fire the good and keep the bad ones enjoyable I was a short term employee here as a contact tracer, the training was awesome, very professional. Management was very helpful and wanted you to succeed. co-workers short term Productive and mentally draining Great work environment just can be a bit stressful you have to sit there and get mentally abused and if you transfer your call you are frowned upon. You are expected to know everything and get short unhelpful answers from those higher up. Good work/life balance, bad performance standards Effectiveness requirements are too high for how little you get paid. Becomes a stressful place to just keep your job and you will barely get recognition for doing more work than normal Info on how to do job always changes Very confusing job information on how to do the job was constantly changing. One of head managers pulled aside a whole group of workers during training to scold us like we were children only because we didn't answer questions on a worksheet that we didn't know the answer to after she said she'd help with questions we didn't know. The same trainer got upset because new employees made the same amount as her then barely wanted to help because of that. Never a straight forward answer on how to do anything. Also there are no people of color on management team for advisors. Managers and traniners Expect too much too quick The training program is very long which makes you think that you are receiving good information. Wrong. They make you sit through 8 hour classes for two weeks without explaining anything you really need to know. When you get to your other half of the training, it’s basically being thrown on the phones expecting to be able to handle the screaming borrowers situation, when you have not properly been taught anything beneficial. Good pay, benefits Short breaks, expected to know everything right out of training Don't. They don't care about staff. I had to spend time in the hospital for a couple of days for an emergency. They wrote me up with occurrences because I didn't have eto. I could get fired because I needed to go to the hospital. Pay not worth it. You get two 15 min breaks and 30 min lunch. After the first 15 min, you only have 15 mins in the whole day to use a bathroom break but you aren't able to move around your breaks. If you go over even a minute to use the bathroom, you get an occurrence. Miss some basic, unless information? Occurrence. My team was training for a different job with hours we agreed to. Over half my training team quit after they moved us to a later shift without telling us. No one couls work those hours because people had kids/family or other jobs but they didn't care. Couldn't move us. At one time, a manager got short with me because they were trying to message me on a system I had no idea about. Instead of emailing or using a different system, they messaged me on a system no one told me about and got angry. Tried to write me up of missing 50+ calls in a day when it was the systems fault. A lot of people missed a lot of calls that day due to a system failure and tried to write everyone up. Work from home So much. No communication, no care for health of employees. No care for anything. Total & Permanent Disability Advisor I Overall I loved the job and did well. I was always a top performer and was able to earn PTO through performance or some team building games. In 2019, Dept of Ed made changes and hiring new employees were harder, we were short staffed and required 1 hr OT mandatory a day. I dealt with disability borrowers yelling all day so it became too stressful. Management was great tho. Great coworker. Great Culture Culture Short Staff Very nice coworkers Its a very nice place to work but training is lacking. there are times when you have a question and it goes unanswered. the training is packed with information and there is not enough time to absorb it all before handling accounts great benefits Mediocre pay Non Stop calls but decent pay Very busy call center with a lot of high stress calls, it can be tiring but the pay is not bad. If you enjoy constant talking this may be a good fit for you Good company, bad news Management is not transparent with employees. My entire group interviewed and was hired for an entirely different job and department than we were thrown on. Very disappointing to have to deal with poor and rude management and to be lied to repeatedly. Tenured employees have such good things to say about this company but myself and about 10 others were done horribly. Right now I wouldn’t recommend anyone put themselves through the stress of working with this company. Great Benefits and ETO No transparency, Bad management, fast training Basic call center job It’s what you’d expect for call center work, which can both be good and bad. I started remote, and the onboarding was a nightmare. All my supervisors were helpful and understanding with my frustrations. It did feel like there was a strong culture, even with being remote. Benefits, Eto, Weekends Off Strict Training, Little Flexibility Surprisingly People Oriented I got a job here as a contact tracer and, even though it was temporary, I felt like I got a pretty good idea about how this company operates; you are constantly reminded that they want you to succeed in your role, there are a ton of resources, and they let me work from home which was a huge plus. nelnet I started working for this company, went through training, was never late, never missed a minute of training or work. I started working and then all of a suden with no notice or anything they tell me they have to let me go because of something that was on my record from 8 years ago and it was also removed from my record. They did not give me a chance to explain or to show proof that it had been removed from my record. I also had plenty of refrences from other companies showing that I am a deticated hard worker, which they never ask for.... good training the only thing they care about is making that dollar, they care nothing about their employees"
INTEL|" Working after an extend off time Monitoring systems and helping users. initially moving the office between building and all the setup needed Interesting learning Net Backup and traing others on it Micro managed Used to be an awesome place to work In their quest to become this all-inclusive company, they have started to exclude some of the workforce. I have seen people fired because someone not involved was offended. PC does not mean Personal Computer at Intel anymore. It has created internal clicks when this place used to be One Intel. You will go through layoffs about every 5 years and hope it's not your turn. The pay is great and the benefits are hard to beat. Great Health insurance and time off. Sabbaticals are nice but so infrequent it's just nice perk. 4 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Great company, reasonable good ethics compared to industry other companies, high technology level, great salary, great working flexibility options, simply great company(there could be company have issues with market and competitions) What is the most stressful part about working at the company? When you hear there is a layoff announcement! What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Relaxed, learning, growing, and competitive too! What is a typical day like for you at the company? Reasonable stress , fun and work-life balance! Avoid the fab if you can Good -Great job security -Nice campus -Great people, coworkers Bad -On-call is a nightmare -So much bureacracy and bloat -Chronically understaffed due to high turnover -Management makes it hard to transfer out of the fab/manufacturing, feels like a prison. Fab job becomes a dead end eventually because the skills don't translate to other jobs. Stay long enough and you'll be stuck there forever. Great rotation program Excellent rotation program and opportunities to learn the business. Finance partners are invested in your success, but the CFO is completely disconnected and over his skis. He should go back to Micron as soon as possible. Good job There are, like anywhere, good and bad about Intel. It is a massive company and experiences will differ. VERY ""corporate"" culture. High turnover when I was there. Good place to work Some management problems but overall good place to work. I cut my teeth here- everyone knows Intel. It is a wonderful thing to put on the resume if you can stay. Laid Off after working 10 years Political fight at all hierarchy level all the time through my 10 years. One team kills another team in Ninja action. Pay is reasonable, hence stuck there just to feel family. intel intel is a company i work for. work in several factories. work in several different states. work with several different peowple. i work with several different areas It's a good to work for. You will get to learn a lot but the compensation is moderate I interned at Intel for 3 months in the Analog Design team. A mentor was assigned to me and I used to give daily updates to him. The good part is that the work is properly assigned based on ones interests and also expertise and the team members are extremely helpful and we can ask any doubts to our mentors. The bad part is that the compensation is not up to the mark considering the company's stature. Very stressful work culture. Very stressful work culture. A typical day at work is full of meetings. Not much to learn new things. management is clueless. workplace culture - Stressfull. Good work facilities. Too much work Experience will all depend on what group you're in. There are plenty of areas at Intel that are great places to work. Generally speaking things get a lot better outside the fab than in it. Within the fab job security tends to be high, but expectations range from demanding but manageable to extremely unreasonable. In my experience as a module engineer the issues with some of the highest turnover modules tend to be created by GLs and EMs rather than higher level policies. A lot of it is excessive meetings. Meetings would be scheduled to go over data daily for separate efforts or projects. GLs would regularly roll into their own meetings 10-15 minutes late and demand the entire thing restart, or sometimes they'd just not show up at all. It wasn't unusual to be in 6 hours of scheduled meetings a day. So then how do you actually generate the data to discuss in these meetings? You work all night, of course. Oh, and don't forget that you're responsible for maintaining a fleet of production equipment and keeping it available for manufacturing (with some tests that bring them down being dubious anyway- understanding of the stats used in SPC at Intel is often pretty weak). It all results in working late nights and weekends trying to fulfill an impossible array of demands. A lot of work is done poorly just because people are desperately doing anything they can think of to get their managers off their backs (this is true of engineers and GLs). However, I felt a strong sense of camaraderie among (most of) the engineers. Everyone knows how tough it is and most people are willing to try to help one another. Not all modules are bad, either. Free coffee/soda, good (but not exceptional) benefits, good co-workers known problem managers are entrenched and will almost never be removed, excessive meetings, constant night/weekend/holiday work Good place, very smart people. Worked in R&D plant in Hillsboro. Exciting atmosphere, but demanding in terms of schedule and splitting the right balance between work and life. As a first job out of university, have no regrets. Boring Old school boys club falling behind the industry underpaid benefits are ok Very corporate Ok for entry level job but not a place to spend your entire career Good first job Good company to work for, especially for first job. Great training and introduction to semiconductor industry. Great benefits and get to work with many different people. Never boring, sometimes too stressful Hate the on-call, love many of my colleagues and that there is always a lot to do and learn. I think a lot depends on which group you are in and how much of a match the work is for you as an individual. Great place to work Great Benefits, learning opportunities, fun filled enviroments but demanding projects and challenges. Long hours Lack of career growth, micro managment Summer intern I did not enjoy my time there. I worked remotely on a project meant for 2 people but was told I was to do it myself. Weekly checkins with managers went well and was told presentation of recommendations went well. They were even going to adopt my recommendations. At the end I was not hired as full time. I did not see it coming as I was told I was doing a good job by many parties throughout the summer. How could you have someone work independently, with virtually no guidance on a project and then tell them ""we're going to take your recommendation but not you."" Now they are laying off 1,000 in the workforce. I would not feel comfortable working for a company that lays off hard working people in the name of profit. Maybe try cutting your outrageous top end salaries to save profit. No sense of accomplishment Some challenges there, but most time boring. i am in sales/marcketing group. I think the company has over hired too many people in the sales group b/c Intel sells only few product with very focused cleints. 2 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Nothing is best part here. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Toxic management. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Noisy and variety of cultures What is a typical day like for you at the company? Very stressful most of the day. most employee based company I ever worked for employee managed company with attention to work life balance and fairness. The time I worked for Intel had to be the most enjoyable time I've ever had in a lifetime. Working after an extend off time Monitoring systems and helping users. initially moving the office between building and all the setup needed Interesting learning Net Backup and traing others on it Micro managed Great place to work if you end up in a good group Company has 100s of groups, some are good and some are toxic. Great place to work if you end up in a good group. Bad group can ruin work life balance. Challenging work Bad work life balance Great work\life balance Great place to work. Great people. Great perks. You can grow there and advance in different direction if you want to try doing new things or even management of people. Great Intel is a great place to work. I learned a lot on the job and I met and worked with great and talented people. I acquired knowledge I did not have prior to working there Manufacturing tech is burnout city Job isn't too bad but if you work in the fab as a tech, expect deaf ears, lack of tools, lack of equipment, lack of good training and low talent. There's a reason why intel can't execute because of many issues in the fab. Techs are not paid what they should and training regimine is totally not what techs need and why Intel struggles. To many cheifs not enough good worker bees. Avoid They treat you like cattle. Highly disorganized. Not worth it. Depending on agency no balanced pay rate. Not worth it. Not allowed to sit if you need just a moment. Long breaks Everything else. Intel is a Great Company Intel is a great company that values its employees and is very inclusive of all people. They provide wonderful benefits and management is is supportive and my whole group worked as a team, backing one another. I had a 3-year contract as an actual Intel employee and if they hadn't put a freeze on adding head count when my contract was up, I would still be there. I loved working at Intel. Overall, great place to work, some issue with some managers Overall great place and people to work for and with. Highly intelligent colleagues and employees. I would recommend them to anyone and would work there again. I enjoyed the environment and work. The bad: My manager let me go for a reason his manager didn't agree with but was supporting his decision. All my quarterly reviews and work were always great and even showed that I excelled from year to year, yet they were willing to let me go because of politics and my managers manager let it happened (even though he disagreed with it). So now I question the integrity of the hierarchy. But again, overall it was a ""great place to work."" it was fine Spent a year here. It was alright. Wouldn't work for them again. Disorganized to say the least, the relationship between planning and actual work is aggressively uncoordinated. Free meals A lot Excellent life/work balance You are pretty much scheduled to work 14 days a month and on top of that, you get a lot of paid leave, vacation and holiday options. Rotating 3 days on 4 days off per week and vice versa. Fast paced job with great team mates! Good pay and team mates, a bit hard if you have little ones at home. Other than that this is a fun and fast work environment. Everyone tries to help you learn and encourages you to grow. They’re very supportive Intel is the corporate giant in the Portland area; expect as much Getting into Intel as a full-time (blue badge) employee is a coveted position. It's a big company and the pay is decent, but with big companies you have to expect typical corporate shenanigans in terms of how employees are treated. You won't be treated like an indentured servant, but the company has no problem exploiting your labor and punishing you for any slights. Decent pay and benefits, great people to work with lack of opportunity to advance/promote, unequal pay for veteran versus new employees Great place to work I'm grateful to had the opportunity to work at Intel for over 16 years. No main issues with upper management and was able expand my work abilities to continued being successful on a yearly basis. If you're eager to learn, communicate with your supervisor and it'll eventually happen. Bow down to the factory. The typical day is filled with distractions from other groups who impose their shortcomings onto other groups because they either planned poorly or undermined processes that are in place. Great compensation and flexibility. I work from home, which is why I'm not looking to leave. The culture is not encouraging. There is little time for developing new competencies. Finally, it is very difficult to assume new roles unless you fit in. Good company, friendly people, but the payment is not fair at all I wish they can take care of their employees more and give some bonuses and encouragements Also would like them to support employees who have goals and target to reach out Intel is good place to work Intel is great place to work and has been good employer so far. I would recommend people to find work at Intel. For growth, you need to move around in the group. It's a different culture Was great until they moved operations overseas, understood the business decision, no sense in shipping back and forth just to test here in the states and have end user in Asia Large corporation. Huge variability on management, expectations and work/life balance. The culture is highly variable with 100k+ employees worldwide working from manufacturing to finance, software, etc. Some managers treat you respectfully like a person while also having high expectations and motivating and effectively training their teams, while some other managers are stuck in the 60s and treat their employees like second-rate people yelling at them and belittling them. The second is more common the closer you are to manufacturing. While some groups are top-notch and working there can be incredibly rewarding, some other groups I would not recommend anybody to work in. Good benefits, challenging work Many meetings that make work-life balance challenging Experience depends on the group When I first started I was miserable and almost quit. Then I changed teams and now it's the best job I've ever had. The structure changes on a regular basis. It's hard to keep track of the org announcements so don't get too comfortable Great company The pay is not exactly what I’d expect for my position but the overall benefits package is great. Love that they offer paid maternity leave. I also feel cared for as a person, my needs are respected and I can take PTO easily when I need a break, vacation, or mental health day. I also get a lot of freedom to determine my schedule and have a say in which projects are prioritized. Good benefits package Stock and pay are less than what you see at comparable companies Loved my job at intel Left intel to relocate for family. Great place to work. Great benefits, 401k, paid holidays. I have taken the knowledge learned in water treatment to note larger scale. Thank you Working after an extend off time Monitoring systems and helping users. initially moving the office between building and all the setup needed Interesting learning Net Backup and traing others on it Micro managed Walk walk walk Finding tools tondo your job is tough. They are broken, missing and misplaced. So you have to walk aimlessly around the factory for miles between toolboxes and if you hit the lottery, you just might find a good screwdriver to use. Management is aware but does nothing to replace tools and still expects performance. Training is like read the specs, and you might figure it out. Tenured techs treat you like fools and expect you to know a task as if you have done it 20! years. There is no parts control. Dangerous to walk around equipment without tripping on something. So be prepared to do 10000 steps a night . 2 Excellent work environment Nice office decoration, large cafeteria with various dishes that suit every need, and recreational facilities. How work turns out for you may vary across departments, but my team has been one of the best and dedicated, full of people willing to support me with anything. Intel's culture teaches people how to behave well in the workplace, and protects them from malicious and toxic behaviors. Work environment, culture reduced benefits Best Place to Burn Out This applies to the intel technology development hub in Hillsboro, OR. Intel management turn over is quick, and company culture dictates individual contributors work extended hours. Employee job performance ratings follow a set distribution (i.e. a few must be rated poor, a majority mediocre, and a few outstanding). This leads to coworker back-biting around performance review time, and best-of-luck if your manager doesn’t like you. It’s a big company with a high burnout rate. They offer pool tables and foosball tables in buildings, yet nobody has time to play! Brilliant people work at intel, so smart people will love being burnt-out there, and can commiserate and drink away their complaints during the drunken team-builders. A few local bars were founded by ex-intel employees, if that means anything. Go in expecting to help change the world, leave with 2 brain cells and bragging rights for escaping the marriage between Skynet and the Empire! Seems disorganized I enjoy working here and the people I work with are great. I even like the compressed schedule even though the 4th day can be rough. The only thing is there is a high turnover rate in management. Great place to work (yourself to death) Expectation is that you work all the time to handle a constantly increasing and often senseless workload. Wellness days are offered, but you had better not use them. Same for nights, weekends, and holidays. You have to set quarterly goals for deliverables outside your main job and then you are set up to fail to be able to achieve them. Management and division shakeups have introduced chaos as leadership freaks out over the tanking stock price. Traditionally a good place to work and learn if you are driven, but quality of vision and leadership has fallen and the effects are felt at every level. bad bad experience due to bad management, no working life balance, stressful everyday, management only know how to kick the ball to everybody else, worthless management Poor road map and no proper deadlines good - perfect wlb, pay is good, good work culture bad - management is very poor and no career growth. Stock prices decline rapidly and missed revenues good place to be good flexibility, work from hope option, lot of teams, good support from management, good bonus, stable job, good work culture, lot of resources to learn. It's a grinder They'll suck the life out of you and take every hour if you let them. Little respect for work-life balance - you're viewed as ""weak"" if you value the ""life"" part. Talented work force, too driven for their own good. Managerial tools encourage climbing on the backs of your peers. Great place to work Culture is great. Great work life balance, benefits, and challenging. Pay is average compared to competitors and with tsmc opening up in north Phoenix, Intel will need to up their salary to stay competitive. Overall great place to work. An all-star workforce I have worked for a number of very large companies. I can say that Intel had the most talented and intelligent workforce I came across. The average person at Intel would be an all star at most companies. It can be a stressful environment at times and sometimes suffers from the same maladies found in all corporate bureaucracies. But I was grateful for my nearly seven years there. Safe, great team, and great benefits The focus here is definitely on safety but the people I work with everyday are great. There isn't a person who I have met that I don't like. Also the benefits are great, between the healthcare, 401k, employee stock, sabbaticals and so many more i almost couldn't imagine wanting to work anywhere else. Excellent Nice place to work. Nice Perks. Fun time. Clean environment. Benefits are good and fun. Good office building. Great air-conditioning. Good facilities. Good job, but needs management regime change Good job with good benefits, but didn’t feel very supported as a Manufacturing Equipment Technician from my Management team. Work culture is in need of serious changes for company growth to succeed. High turnover rate currently Fun, Learn, but Slow Intel has a great sense of teamworks and is able to provide a space for intern to slowly but surely join a team head first in their projects. There are many processes that are slow and take a long time to get approved etc due to constraints within departments. Great place to work Great place to work. Fun while learning if you find a good team to work with. Rewarding and encouraging. Very good health insurance and benefits. Internal award systems on top of compensation. Long days Great Intern. No complaints. I enjoyed seeing the people and lunch breaks with them. The people that work here are truly amazing and full of knowledge. I was star struck Great pay. The people are really dry though. The pay and benefits are great. The people who work at Intel are EXTREMELY dry and unimpressed with everything and everyone around them. They will rarely crack jokes, smile or goof around. Other than that… it’s alright. Great place to work. Lots of OT Good life balance and lots of OT If you need money. Traning is provided on the job and training is about 6 months before you are on you own. Good luck. Intel - A Great Place To Work I’ve only been with Intel for 3 weeks now, but the overall experience has been superb. My viewpoints are derived from my experiences with the Corporate Services - Electrical Team. Everyone I have had the pleasure of working with has been great, the team I am a part of is one of the best mashups of skillsets I have ever been a part of in my career. So much to learn to keep you competitive in your area of expertise and plenty of fringe benefits or employee perks to keep you engaged. I would absolutely recommend working at Intel, so far it seems like a fantastic place to work and grow professionally. Good luck! Working after an extend off time Monitoring systems and helping users. initially moving the office between building and all the setup needed Interesting learning Net Backup and traing others on it Micro managed The hardest part job, hard place to work at Was trying to understand management, when then there a downturn how there reaction to situations. Can’t say lot some mangers work ok, but far and between. I had good ones and some really bad ones. Just flip a coin. Teamwork people work hard together! Healthcare changes every year! Great work life balance Good Company to work for With good work life balance Lot of projects to handle Not many Product Management Jobs People not familiar with PM roles and responsibilities It all depends on your department/manager Have switched between two jobs internally, but also many different managers. They finally focused on paying us what they should be which is great, but money is not worth it with some managers. With jobs that need to support 24x7 factories and high impact products, work load is very intense and hours can be very intense. With the added focus of cutting costs, teams ended up understaffed a lot. To the point, where I am currently on a severely understaffed team with no option to backfill the roles for people who have been leaving. When I had a good manager, they found ways to balance all of this without putting too much on the engineers. With the bad managers, it all ends up with pushing the engineers until many start looking for new jobs. As for why it depends on department, when working in factory training was great and well documented. It was easy to know what to do and how to do it (politics were a nightmare though). Current department, training is awful, no documents to find, and can be very hard to find the resources need to do your work. Good place to work with great benefits Intel is a good place to work. Great benefits, maternity leave is 24 weeks, and stock options are a huge perk. Additionally get quarterly and annual bonuses. Great quality of life and happy workers Intel has definitely set the standard. I moved out of the area which is the only reason I left the company. I can definitely see me working my way to the top if I didn't move out of state. Only negative was my manager wasn't very aware of the talent and capabilities of his team, he was definitely only focused on covering his butt. My team was great. I love the schedule, 3 on 4 off and then 4 in 3 off...man! So much time for family. It is very obvious as an Intel employee you are cared for and you are given the resources you need to be great. Very Stressful Intel is a very large company but are not paying good for performing work. Very demanding job and lots of management pressure on the technicians but very good benefits. Regarding Covid vaccination it was lots of pressure to take the vaccine and almost made mandatory until the Supreme Court made it unlawful in December of last year During Covid free food, free fruits and beverages all the time Very demanding and not taking care of the people after injuries at work Tough place Extensive workload. Work at least 12 hours a day and the most of the people are doing politics instead of working hard. Moreover it is really hot in Arizona and scorpions are everywhere. The location at Arizona is not good enough for having good restaurants or a good life, only good for H-1B and immigrants. I plan to leave soon. Culture I worked in the sub-fab for the major of my time at Intel. I was blessed to have worked with a great supportive team. All the member very helpful and gave me plenty advice as a new guy. I would definitely recommend. Good place to work Decent place to work for someone with semiconductor background. The new CEO has vision and there is hope that the company will turn around. Semiconductor technology tends to have long development cycles, culture resistant to change, and most of the low-hanging fruit have been picked in R&D. But that isn't unique to Intel. culture, learning slow promotions, poor stock performance, small RSU grant Encouraging environment Exposure to latest technology, motivation to work hard, result orientated environment. Good pay and work life balance. New employee training is done with care. Solid company to work for I enjoyed the culture, the mission, and the opportunties they provide to the employees. At the time, the base pay was below my expectations and what the market was offering. Overall it was a good company to work for with very smart people, and from my experience, good managers. Supportive and huge As an intern in a company this large, especially in supply chain, you get a lot of opportunity to learn from some of the best people in the industry. People are very knowledgeable and willing to help. Sometimes can be hard to navigate due to the sheer size. Great workplace During my internship, my mentors and managers were very helpful and supportive. The given project was very well-defined and challenging. If you like to work on challenging and innovative projects then it is a really good place to work. I really enjoyed and learned a lot during my internship. Good work/life balance but overall declining The company has very smart people around. Good place for fresh graduates to learn. Great work-life balance. Poor management and not very connected to employee Nice work Woking here is good. Company compensation and culture is nice. CEO Pat is a very inspiring person. Intel valued it's employees, working environment is great. Great people to work with It’s just a job with a big name. No real training. Learn as you go. It’s all about numbers. Shipping is a joke. People act like they’re working but just passing the time. Lunch Break to short Good place to work Good place to work, but being on call is not the best part of the job! Some managers are great! Some of thwm, no so much. Benefits are great, especially sabbatical 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Benefits and diversity What is the most stressful part about working at the company? 24/7 manufacturing and global presence leads to 0 downtime. It’s on you as an employee to establish working scope/boundaries as there is always more important work to be done. Interesting and challenging A typical work day will consist of a handful of meetings with your team and the stakeholders of the projects you work on. If you have good management then the number of meetings throughout the week will be fewer than others as your time should be spent developing software. Throughout the week you may be attending or running code review sessions as well as providing new software versions to the testers of your project. There’s never a shortage of work to be done which is good but that can also take away from the quality of work if priorities are not being managed. No shortage of work, paid leave, flexible in terms of on-site vs. remote Difficult work life balance Not to be trusted Intel pays well and has great benefits, but they will lie to you, be careful, they are not to be trusted, and that didn’t just affect me, it affected others I worked with! Their focus is the most diverse candidates, not the most qualified candidates! Take all this for what it’s worth, I moved on to Samsung in Austin! Great pay, schedule and benefits, a lot of really great people Untrustworthy, a lot of snakes Working after an extend off time Monitoring systems and helping users. initially moving the office between building and all the setup needed Interesting learning Net Backup and traing others on it Micro managed Contract Came on as a consultant and was treated like less than during my entire contract. The environment was hostile and demanding. Yelling in meetings acceptable. Management takes credit for work. very active environment I absolutely love working here, amazing benefits, pay, time off, room for advancement. only downside I can think of is they expect us to learn so many different systems it can get a little overwhelming. 1 Great Job Culture and different opportunities for jobs Encouraging work environment with a modern mindset. Also has many opportunities to try different jobs within the company. Did not feel micromanaged and felt my career path was valued. Great place to work Unfortunately night shift is poorly managed. Intel is trying to fix that with the implementation of an on shift night manager but that is still very new. The leadership on night shift sucks in my group but that's more of a people problem than that of the company. Overall it is a great place to work with amazing and competitive benefits. My experience alone is not a great reflection of the company as a whole. The culture in my group is very competitive and that's nice most of the time but can get exhausting. Been waiting on a promo for awhile now and haven't received any information contrary to me deserving one so that is an obvious negative in my case. Great benefits. Productivity. Minimal support for night shift. Employee oriented yet focused on job demands Employee oriented yet focused on job demands. Intel has a well-deserved end result in mind and they rely on its workers to accomplish this and so they provide everything that you should need make you comfortable relaxed tools to get the job done and management who communicates at any level and listens to your ideas and promotes individual progress as well as progress as a team Ambiente de trabajo competitivo Si busca una empresa para crecer o realizar una pasantía Intel es una excelente opción. Great place to work if you like working Manager was awesome. I had the time and resources to excel in my position. The benefits were great, and the perks were too. Hardest part was being in cleanroom attire for 80% of the day. Benefits, Co-workers Cross-Shift communication was lacking Of course, don't have expectations with huge companies like Intel. There will be people who will ask for you to do it a specific way, which is the way they've been doing it for several years (8 yrs+), despite it not being the most efficient. There are people who are very addicted to having control of the work they do despite them having so many meetings and sometimes not having enough time to finalize tasks on time - yet, they refuse to give up those responsibilities in fear of becoming irrelevant. Overall, an okay company but just wasn't the fit for me. Depends on product line or otherwise Very hectic if on a product line. Otherwise other teams are very relaxed. Compensation is what you negotiate when you enter. Forget great raises once you are in. cutting edge work poor pay, no raises, winner takes all causes one person to get 10% raise and all others 1%. Wont even beat inflation. 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? I had two nice colleagues What is the most stressful part about working at the company? The lack of accountability in leadership. Team members that will throw you under the bus. They speak a core value as ""one Intel,"" yet it's a divided company. No cohesiveness. Will tell you that it will take 12-18 months to fully grasp your role but chastise you within the first 4-5 months if you don't understand something. Most of training provided doesn't pertain to job. No diversity. High volume. Managers can be condescending and very passive aggressive. Comments made about immigrants taking jobs and pay from US citizens was thrown around very loosely. You're on a one man island at Intel. Save yourself the trouble and work for other reputable IT companies. Also, they will try to low ball you. 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? The pay and benefits What is the most stressful part about working at the company? The people What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Helpful and caring supervisors. Great work/life balance. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Long days but short weeks 4 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Pay and benefits are above average What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Compressed work week on nights has worsened chronic mental health issues I have What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Majority of people are friendly and supportive. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Addressing tool issues, working on building relationships with people of all sorts of different ages and backgrounds. Read alit of spec Intel make sure you have the full understanding of the tool that you will be working on before they release you to work by yourself I enjoy my day at Intel They treat everyone the same awesome company to work for I worked at intel twice and each time I worked there that was the best place to work. People respect each other and treat each other with respected. Training is awesome. Would like to work for intel again.. Great company!! Free lunches good pay benefits None Compensation is great, CWW allows you to have time off for other activities. Training can be a challenging at times you have to train and sustain at the same time which can create stressful situations. Opportunity to move from non-exempt to a exempt role isn’t really clear. Great benefits great growth Intel is a big corporate and there is always opportunities to grow as an employer and learn many hands on skills. Deadlines can be stressful but other than that great place to work Good, stable income Having Intel on your resume is awesome! it is a pretty big company, so it may not feel as personal as working for a smaller company or a start-up. It is a very revolutionary space to be in, though. Good place to work, depending on your department Almost everything at Intel is perfect, besides the 3 year contract and official hire in people. They can give you the 3 year contract (ICE) even though you've been with them for longer, and have a degree, they'll give the non-contract to a 19 yr old girl who sits on her phone all day doing nothing. Became top performer across all shifts in my department, asked to be taken off ICE multiple times, got denied, then get voluntold into a harder department with a 60-80% turnover rate for the raise and non-contract position I deserved in the first place. In the end, left a sour taste in my mouth, but a good place to work, VERY much depending on your department AND your coworkers. Company has a high turnover rate for new college graduates so DYOR. Free lunches, own your pace, safety, culture No official training, favoritism towards females, have to remind managers multiple times you have a degree Overall good working environment with lots of opportunities for growth Managers were helpful with solving problems and majority of the colleagues were also friendly and helpful. The work given to me was challenging at times but I felt that it was fair and helped me grow in my skills. Incredible place to work. Intel was an incredible place to work, for the fact I moved out of state I would have retired there. The work life balance is great, benefits and pay is spot on. They care about there employees and your not just a number. Everything Nothing"
Comcast|" work Great place to work the schedule are rough the supervisors are informative and I can't complain I just want a better shift the products are awesome the environment is great because of the changes that are going on so this is a great company Benefits Work Schedule Work life A lot of customers on a daily basis but they are activities and engagement to make the virtual life better being remote also allows for work life balance Great work with the right team The training process was paid and extensive. Tools and everything are provided, including a generous boot allowance. The people on my initial team were awesome, including the person I shadowed with. Super helpful getting me on my feet. If you get the right supervisor it's a great place to work, if not good luck. Best Job Ever Great pay and benefits! Treat there employees like kings and queens. I miss it! Smart management. Considering reapplying. Flexible schedule if your good at your job. Great employer Comcast is easily one of the best employers I've had, hands down! Tons of opportunities for growth and the benefits are great. Would definitely work for them again if given the right opportunity Low pay but light workload and great benefits Not a bad job haven’t made it a year yet. Looking for a pay increase. I feel underpaid but think raises or promotions will occur. Willing to wait it out and see how it goes. I took a $30k pay cut in comparison to my other job… Work from home Love working for Comcast best company with the best management who actually care about their employee’s! Good pay partially commission based but it’s fun Good pay Good pay and cheap internet and tv, must be good at sales and youll love it, good time off, good 401k plan, very flexible hours. Very busy during season in Fl, some customers are really angry but just do your best to get the job done It's not thes same Comcast it was 20 years ago. You need a godfather to get promoted. Fun place to work. Good benefits. Perks aren't as good as the old days. Would feel unsafe going to downtown Philadelphia. Benefits are cater to the young, not the older folks. Free Breakfast and Lunch, and good benefits. The company is WOKE and promotes incompent folks based on race, etc. 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Working from home What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Not a thing What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Beautiful What is a typical day like for you at the company? Easy/ stress free/ support / team work Poor senior leadership The work is not bad. Annual pay increase does not compensate for annual insurance increase. Upper senior leadership is poor. Company moral suffers and it is not a safe place to be a supervisor or manager. Unrealistic goals to meet that are out of technicians control. Hardest part of the job is trying to satisfy goals set by someone who has never worked in the field. Most enjoyable part of the job is working independently. Retention I took 60-70 calls per day. This is a fast paced call center and I dealt with customers who were near the brink of cancelling all services such as cable TV, internet, phone, mobile, and so on. It’s not a job for everyone. Great benefits. Stressful environment From a management pov and benefits they really want to take care of you but it’s hard to please everyone. Especially customers. C in Comcast stands for change Benefits culture Stress hitting goal numbers Take what you can and run! Know when to leave. Worked here for 10 years. Reorgs happen with this business. Some you'll sense coming and other times you're blindsided. Free cable and internet is always a plus. Do not allow that to be the reason stay, or PTO. That can be negotiated elsewhere. Excellent culture but.. The culture is fantastic and so are the benefits but the pay is honestly terrible and the goals are unrealistic. I feel like they trap you into thinking it’s going to be such a great position and even give you great ramped commission but once you’re fully on your own- you end up drowning with no hopes of staying afloat. I don’t agree that I should be struggling to feed my family while working for a billion dollar company. Low cost services, benefits, culture Pay, high stress, unrealistic goals Great people over worked due to processes Every day you are asked to take care of customer issues and restore the customer's faith in the company. A love for taking care of customers is a must. Management is a get-in-where-you-fit-in type of culture. 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Competitive wages, benefits, & training. They appreciate individual talent and build on that to enhance both your career and the company’s goals. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? The challenge to provide top notch service and product under ever changing customer demands. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? You are provided all that you need to succeed instead environment. Pretty good place to work I love working from home. The benefits are really good. The company doesn’t give you a way to solve customer issues. You end up dealing with very frustrated customers all day. Metrics are tough to meet as well. Great benefits, time off Great benefits, time off. At times metrics are unreal great employee discount on services, discount on Disney tickets. quarterly bonuses. well informed on the products that they offer Hard work but great company. If you like to work on your own and pretty much be your own boss if you getting the work done, this is a good job. Benefits are pretty good as well. Practically free cable and you get to take your work van home. Low wages Preaches ""equality and equity"" but the company doesn't want to pay their employees comparable wages to other companies in the same industry LOW WAGES. They don't want to promote their employees who have been loyal to the company. 15 years without a promotion, DISGUSTING! Discounted cable and internet Low wages, they treat you like you are a delivery driver rather than a technician, I stay on the road 2+ hours a day work Great place to work the schedule are rough the supervisors are informative and I can't complain I just want a better shift the products are awesome the environment is great because of the changes that are going on so this is a great company Benefits Work Schedule Great company benefits. Poor leadership Led a team of 10-12 employees. Received a lot of training and the necessary tools to be successful. However, the leadership in my center was lacking and created an unprofessional environment. The company does provide great benefits. Benefits Poor Leadership Very stressful but great benefit I have been at comcast for 9ys, and was layoffed along with 400 other people due to company restructuring. I was given a 9 week severance one week for each year I worked. Sadly have had many health related problems since working there mentally and physically. And was not give any assistance on health care but cobra's which covers nothing my meds for my mental illness are 1500 per month without insurance and the path for breast cancer prevention and treatment is well its breast cancer yes they are aware of my health condition. I'm fighting for good health and looking for a new job asap. You have to be a very patient person and conduct your self in a calm manner. Customer are customer and they all feel they are right even when they are wrong. You do get quarterly bonus and great discounts on tv and internet service. But the due put alot or pressure on you to sale even if the hire you for there repair dept. 1 Large Company that still has growing pains There is a lot of professional growth available to those who work hard and aim high. There are still growing pains depending on the group / dept you're in. A lot of jobs are specific to the company as far as work you do which can make it hard to transition or move to another department or even company. There is not a ton of daily work direction, at times. It is a lot of independent / self-starting work when you're slow, other times you will work 10-hour days nonstop to catch up to work being dumped on you. Compared to many other companies I have looked at, Comcast is not as competitive in pay, which they use the ""heavily discounted services"" as the reason, but there is definitely an opportunity to review pay and title structures to keep up with rising cost of living changes. Work from home full time, strong leadership in certain groups, good time off and benefits options Work life balance struggles, lower / less competitive pay, office politics Back breaking work and unrealistic Metrics to achieve, for very little compensation.. -Typical day is a 6-7 jobs . Mixed bag of installs and trouble calls with poor routing. Usually long days with little time for lunch. - You do get some training but most of it is on the job and anything additional is short video tutorials. Most of your knowledge will be based on how much you learn on your own. -Management is constantly rotated out , so there is no cohesiveness. They're only worried about meeting the metrics but give no direction or means of attaining them. - Work place moral is terrible. No team work whatsoever. To get help at most jobs almost impossible. -The job isn't hard to learn but you have to do everyone else's job daily . Supervisor, dispatcher, customer service, and then your own . To Stressful for the pay. -One Enjoyable thing is not being confined to an office. Discounted Cable services Doesn't Pay well, Long Days, Small Opportunities for Growth .No Work-life balance 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Comcast is a great place to be an employed. The benefits are designed to care for the employee. The work/Life balance flexibility is excellent. I feel valued there. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? They re-org a lot. After you have been through a few you realize, generally the work stays the same the parts completing the work get interchanged. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? The culture is friendly and challenging. Good and bad Pay is far below promised, team morale is terrible, favoritism, benefits great. Many feel can’t openly talk to manager. The morale was not good and concerning. The best job I ever had! 11 year employee with the company, brought in as a Sr. Manager for Comcast Business, and advanced through several promotions, relocations, and remarkable career growth. Wonderful company, excellent leadership, and opportunities abound. Great team members, interesting projects No cons -- I loved it here 4 stars What is the best part of working at the company? pay and insurance What is the most stressful part about working at the company? heavy lifting What is the work environment and culture like at the company? good place to work What is a typical day like for you at the company? busy and lots of driving Work was fine. Company and management not. This company all be it successful does not value employees or their individual strengths. Promotions when finally a spot opens are done by picking favorites. The pay is substandard for the type of physical work preformed. Free tools and uniforms. Take home van. Overbooked. Not enough techs to complete assigned work. Not the best but good money good management A lot of potential to advance here especially if you work hard. You honestly work for yourself to an extent with exception to Friday meeting days. You do your job you won’t / rarely receive calls from management. Pay on average was 1300+ a 2 weeks. Good starter job with big time company Some days are harder then others but as long as your supervisor is cool then the job is laid back and enjoyable. Benefits are good and pay increases every year according to productivity. 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? Terrible work hours go off point system and very bad at communicating when system issues occur What is the most stressful part about working at the company? I would only recommend this if you done and out no chance of moving up What is a typical day like for you at the company? Hectic just lazy management terrible management honestly 4 stars What is the best part of working at the company? It was like having my own business What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Having to be there every morning for 30 minutes What is the work environment and culture like at the company? I work environment with stress free What is a typical day like for you at the company? Last stop I start at 9:00 I finished at 10:00 p.m. everyday Fun and welcoming workplace They are a great company to work with. They provide proficcient train to be sure you are ready and equipped to do the role in which you are placed in. Its competitive and fun at times, as well as fast paced and repetitive at others. Put up with a lot of stress The pay and the benefits were good, however you had to tolerate a lot of stress and even as a csr you were required to sell add ons the customer didn't have (internet, cable, home phone, home security) with no commissions. 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? The only best part is it's remote What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Everything about it What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Horrible they don't care about they people just money . What is a typical day like for you at the company? Stressful , A manager is always in your in all the time Not for everyone Good pay and benefits package. Lots of paid training available. Very robotic processes that cause an overly stressful work environment that makes the value of the salary questionable. Learning equipment, usage, helping tech with problems on installations Loved working at all my jobs and I love learning new things. Helping techs and learning from them. Also learning about the Comcast and Wipro companies. . Good job Most enjoyable part of the jon is the work life balance. As a tech you work 4 days on and get 3 off ina row. Some perks are Competitive pay. Diverse hiring. Regular raises as long as you meet your metrics which do change every year. Nice family environment, lots of help from peers. Hardest part of the job would be some of the environments or elements (working in attics/crawl spaces and in the rain/heat) The constant change of work required apps/tools and the changing of metrics can also be very frustrating. 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Comcast is a Great Company and they take care of their employees. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? You have to be nimble and flexible because things change at a moment's notice. I dealt with it well and delivered the message to my team. Comcast has a business to run and sometimes it will test your stress level. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Always an open door no matter what level of leadership, you always have someone available to you in order to address issues. Inclusive and diverse culture. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Stick to plans you make and prepare to work until the job is complete so that deadlines are made. work Great place to work the schedule are rough the supervisors are informative and I can't complain I just want a better shift the products are awesome the environment is great because of the changes that are going on so this is a great company Benefits Work Schedule Amazing company Great benefits amazing leadership, pay is really good. They will get you all the tools, equipment van. They take care of you and your family. Best company Senior Account Executive I started at Comcast D2D residential and worked my way up to Senior Business Account Executive. Great product but commission structure isn't that lucrative. Dishonest Didn’t learn much in training. Supervisors aren’t helpful. Constant changes. Was totally dishonest about compensation during the hiring process. Not worth the stress. They just laid off 1/3 of all employees There is no real job security anymore. Changes are made by marketing and upper management without any real knowledge of the implications those changes have on the running of systems on the front agent side of things. The good supervisors and managers there are few and far between, the rest are self-serving and lie. It is a shame because until recently, I loved working there. discount on cable and internet, work from home stress, lack of job security Good Pay Pay was solid for a starter outside sales role, but the service mentality is not one that I was a fan of. We promised much but would fail to deliver consistently. 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? Constant backstabbing and helping buddies instead of supporting and promoting the best employees. Forget it if you’re not a super outspoken liberal. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Fear of job being “retitled” and then eliminated What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Woke and rah-rah. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Wasted time in trainings and DEI instead of solving customer issues and lowering costs. Great company, but heavy work load The Good - Comcast is a great company to work for, they have excellent benifits and are very inclusive. The Bad - certain departments at Comcast run very lean, meaning a lot of work and few workers, so workload on each employee is heavy and at times overload. Benifits - insurance, bonuses and free/low cost service Workload and stress level CAMC Remote Rep Was unlucky enough to land a position at the beginning of the pandemic. Found out extremely quick that training was near nonexistent and mostly absolutely pointless. 64 Person class quickly dwindled to less than 5 by the time ""training"" was complete. God forbid you expressed your concern with how terrible the training was on every level. That just meant you were thrown out early on. Then it dwindled more when we got a taste of what it is exactly that we'd be doing. Basically, you're damage control for this company because all aspects of their processes are disjointed and unaligned for success. Unfortunately, all you're told during ""training"" is that the only way to figure out our jobs was to just jump in. If that doesn't instill confidence, I have no idea what does. Managers were bounced around so quick that we were on our 4th by the time their make-believe ""training"" was complete. At that point you have zero relationship with them and they could care less about anything you may be dealing with during the peak of a pandemic. If you do reach out to them in confidence, the company will quickly react to pull the plug on your position. The only somewhat decent thing they did was benefits which you receive on day 1. Unfortunately, that meant that all of us had to deal with others via Zoom, on day freaking 2 mind you, how they can make Dr. appointments and file claims. I know that's what I was concerned about after seeing how pathetic the structure was. Overall, it's nothing more than an office environment call center. They all gossip and complain about the customers, which I Horrible management in the Bay Area Management doesn’t care if you do great for 5 months. They pat you on the back and then complain that you have 1 off month. Culture isn’t there and they treat account executives like a retail environment. Great benefits but decreasing pay and more work With the company for over 5 years, made a lot more in the beginning than towards the end, constantly taking away opportunities to make commission, constantly changing the commission structure, not very upfront and honest when they make changes they know employees won’t like, overall not nearly the job it used to be, decreased pay, your asked to do a lot on your calls and more responsibilities are always being added, PTO allowance and benefits are still as good as your gonna get anywhere, Great people, benefits. Goals became unobtainable due to moving bar. Great people, benefits. Goals became unobtainable due to moving bar. Overall company culture shifted away from employees' wellbeing to a micromanagement atmosphere. Customers also became more abusive on calls. Great Place to Make money It's stressful to work with customers all day and when they are mad, but if you can get pass that, you can make really good money compared to any other entry level sales job Too much pressure The job was good when you could just deal and help the customer however the demands with metrics was too high and technical support should not have sales metrics. Great management and team environment Best job I ever had and I worked there for 19 years. I am hoping to get back because I miss my family. Management does a great job training and so does the rest of your team. They do not micromanage. Once you know the job, they let you do it without looking over your shoulder. Horrible Clown show, unprofessional. No support from management using their archaic system that is not fit for any serious business. Disconnected calls counting towards your sales percentage and making their goals constantly unreachable. Joke of a job, AVOID ! Too much micro management Good benefits. Pay is metric based. Heavy micro management. Stress level can be high at times due to lack of useful support from management. Work enviroment overall is ok Great for entry level sales I think this job is good for someone who has little to no experience in sales. If you have experience choose another position. This job entails a lot of beating dead leads and making a ton of meaningless calls to freezing cold leads 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? Leaving the parking lot for the last time. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Being honest. Not lying to subscribers. Being a representative with their brand having false hope of being proud to work for them. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? The feild work is challenging, interesting, unique as broadband communications is high technology not learned in college. It requires trade-school education along with special training courses offered by specialized manufacturers such as Magnavox. The politics are off the scale within the administration. Corruption / Crisis managment throughout the enire infrastructure. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Receive work orders, discuss trouble area problems, check out materials & specialized measuring instruments. Work on resolving the problem(s) then verify satisfied subscribers Great people Call center environment with good health insurance and support from upper management. Good training and great people to work with. Cafe and workout room Decent Benefits stressful work environment Customer service position turned into sales. They will continue to add on more responsibilities without any pay increases. If you stay in the position more than 1-2 years you're stuck. work Great place to work the schedule are rough the supervisors are informative and I can't complain I just want a better shift the products are awesome the environment is great because of the changes that are going on so this is a great company Benefits Work Schedule 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? The pay was good at first What is the most stressful part about working at the company? They would lower the pay. No opportunity for growth. Cheat you out of commission. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Toxic. Extremely stressful. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Try and sell products to people who don’t want them. Have to lie and say it’s the best deal because if you sell what they call in for you get docked from your commission and then fired. 1 Great place Was a great place to work and offered me and my family stability. The hours worked for us and the pay was great for the family. The leadership was super helpful. 1 its ok the job is a job that pays you money but sometimes the money is taxed and you do not make as a much money as you were paid so you have to work to make more money Okay job. Can be extremely stressful so make sure you utilize their medical benefits. And try not to take anything personal because people say mean things when they're frustrated and confused. Very Engaging, Awesome Co-Workers, Supportive Leadership, Fast-Paced The pace is fast do come prepared to work. The benefits are amazing, and the staff is very supportive of one another. There can be some process challenges, but they will help you work through them. If you have personal drive and motivation this company would be a perfect fit for you. Awesome place Great place to work I absolutely loved it sadly I had to move away but it’s a chill place depending on where u work only think I can say was bad was standing all day and angry customers Great benefits! Pay is not equal. Merit raises decreased by half last 5 years At first you are welcomed and they make you excited and valued. They don’t value long term employees even with consistent good performance. Favoritism. Not much room for advancement. As a tech, you handle everything! As long as you know the job and do well you are left alone. But don’t plan on making more than 25 an hour and you never get off on time. Especially on Saturdays. Great services. Terrible company. Metrics are unrealistic and always changing. Manipulated to avoid giving merit raises. Company vehicle, company phone, 401k, courtesy services Unrealistic metrics, too political, favoritism in advancements, bad apples get to advance, deceitful, don’t follow their own credo There's Something Beter Back to back calls no matter what shift you're on. Rarely get a chance to breathe between calls. Not enough PTO if you're a single parent Too much work for not enough money and they try to tell you that the benefits add to your pay. Expect layoffs every year, they just wont use the word layoff :) People are the best reason to do the job The amount of work vs the money you make was an insult to Me..... The worst part is working in the element's and Nobody caring about our individual health or anything else etc...... Customers showing Love The pay was Horrible Good company Great management very fair and balanced company very fast paced and ever changing no complaints besides workload and irate customers expecting miracles spent many happy years here Great company it always people that mess it up You're gonna get out what you put into it so make sure you work hard and remember it's a sales position it is a good company who had room for growth however just make sure you have your own back and document everything necessary if you want to move up in this company make sure you always know your boss's boss Typical American Corporate If you aren’t worried to have outside life from work, then this is a position for you. CONcast is one of the worst to not care of your mental state nor the issues you may face with life. They want nothing more than someone to just be there to manage their system while leadership pads pockets. You never see nor hear from divisional leadership and above. There is a reason CONcast is one of the worst corporations in America, numbers don’t lie. Cheap cable bill Leadership, work/life balance, respect to you as a person, metric driven, NOT customer driven Started great, ended disappointing When I started I had a great team, manager and HR. By the end we were understaffed, underpaid and overloaded with poor management and HR. Benefits were pretty good though. Productive, Fun, and Rewarding Workplace Comcast really gives back to its employees. I felt appreciated as well as valued. I was able to move up I was more then a number. They care about their employees. Stressful Organization pushing for sales, they do not care for the customers. If you had a lower package to offer the customer & you did before the customer ask to cancel service, you got a coaching for that. They are not customer focus, just their pockets. Does not care about employees Department-wide 38% pay-cuts in less than 2 years and no chance to advance due to the office politics involved. They consider your normal benefits and free Internet as part of your ‘overall salary’ to make it seem as though they are doing right - Very deceiving company to work for Free internet Pay cuts, not easy to move up Good people, leadership and opportunity to grow. Too many ""restructures"" You can go as far as you're willing to put work in for. Leadership for the most part actually tries to lead and guide you towards success. Company however has done so many ""restructures"" ie letting people go for even the smallest infraction that the family aspect doesn't feel genuine. Challenging and great opportunities Pay is competitive, fair. Work culture positive. Good work rewarded with opportunities. Over ten years, I worked in 4 different departments (promoted in each change). Having worked at other large companies, my time at Comcast by far the best experience. Productive and fun workplace Great place to work free triple play internet cable phone. Never a boring day always on the go. Some jobs can be easy some are difficult depending what area you are working in 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? Benefits, PTO, ‘courtesy’ internet What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Everything. No security, pay is below average especially considering this is a fortune 50 company making billions. Management is completely disconnected from frontline workers. They’re outsourcing everything and eliminating jobs in the US What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Isolation.. no interaction whatsoever with peers or leadership work Great place to work the schedule are rough the supervisors are informative and I can't complain I just want a better shift the products are awesome the environment is great because of the changes that are going on so this is a great company Benefits Work Schedule Comcast is a joke, don't even bother Between being lied to about the role I was hired for,then forced to work in an entirely different department, as well as being scrutinized and micro-managed, I see why this company has a high turnover rate for customer support. I got paid on time, that's the only positive note Lies, deceit, broken equipment, and upper management breathing down your neck far too ften 1 Great place to learn and use technical skills. Management encourages technical growth and allows everyone a voice in accomplishing company goals. Work hours are flexible; emphasis is on accomplishing tasks rather than being seated at you desk. Compensation and benefits are first rate. Good benefits and perks Good benefits and perks. Schedule sucks cause you have to work every weekend. They don’t offer any straight weekday shifts no matter how long you work there. Constant flow of calls to make money Was definitely an experience to make money. A lot of nonstop calls but the potential to make money was on every single call. I would recommend this company to someone who doesn’t mind working in a call center and handling customers needs including billing. Good job, once upon a time I've worked here about 5 years now. It was okay for the first 2 years. After 2 years, the company definitely took a turn for worse. The local manager had no idea how to run a tight ship. There was always miscommunication, management was never on the same page on anything. We didn't have a local HR rep for the last year, leaving a lot of us employees unsupported by anyone. Do NOT attempt to advance. Advancement was always encouraged, but never compensated. They will take advantage of people that have good, honest work. If you keep quiet and stick your head in the sand, this place is for you. The physical work can break down a lot of people. 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? Terrible place What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Everything What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Horrible place What is a typical day like for you at the company? Stressful af The managment was a bunch of kids with no experience. It was horrible! Not only are you answering the phone every minute, but you are also constantly apologizing on behalf of the company. The management was inconsistent and sometimes way over the line. I was treated as if I wasn't important or even a part of the customer service team. There was no training and no upward mobility. I would not recommend it! Working with the staff and management Great company they work well with there employee’s caring environment. There levels of management Director of Security employed by Comcast a Assistant Director of Security, for all of the security officer’s we have a Account Manager site supervisors and shift leads which is employed be Allied Universal Security Company. 2 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Company’s 401-k match and the employees stock purchase option, What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Lack of tools and systems to effectively address Customer concerns. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Supervisors use fear tactics rather than positive reinforcement to drive team results. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Stressful Entry level job with decent benefits The culture is great for me. You get back what you put in. There is room for advancement if you want it. The negative is would be corporate, there is a disconnect. They put the needs of the company first, realistically I wouldn't expect anything different. It's what I've come to expect from them over the years. Supervisors and managers are supportive and always available. 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? Nothing really. They lie to their customers and expect you to do the same. Immoral and reprehensible company. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? No matter what department you work in they want you to sell. If you don't, you don't ""succeed"" no matter how many calls or resolves you get. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Stressful, secluded, immoral, and everyone is trying to have intercourse with everyone. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Come in sit down, log in, take calls, never get a supervisor to help, take a break, take more calls, take lunch, take more calls, take a break, log out and go home. 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? The team spirit, our supervisors were professional, informative and really listened to what we had to say and they resolved our issues expeditiously. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? There were no stressful parts working at the company. In customer service we just followed the rule of not taking it personal what was said by the customers and made sure we completed one call resolutions for each and every customer. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Originally when I started we worked onsite. It was a very calming environment, very clean and organized, everyone worked together and helped one another. When we transitioned to working remote from home it was great. Our Supervisors were still available for us, nothing different except you were working from home. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Answered Inbound calls, ascertained the customer's issue, resolved the issued, upsold the customer available products to enhance their viewing pleasure. You are a Number You are not treated like a person when you work for this company - you are just a metric. The work is interesting and engaging at first. However, due to the constant pressure to meet your numbers, the work became overbearing. There was a toxic culture in the office and amongst supervisors. Employees were expected to bend the rules to ensure their team met the monthly quota. Corporate would consistently increase the amount of work needed to be done and not increase the time allotted. The stress of balancing meeting the numbers and staying within the lines was absurd. The company boasts job advancement but there were employees twice my age working the same job for twenty years. This was not my worst job experience, but consider your options before you start this career. exciting, fun, challenge to grow cable installer for residential and commercial, typical day involves doing a couple installs for businesses and a few repairs to business services. dealing with customers every step. hardest part was having to use a 18 ladder to climb up and electric pole. most enjoyable part was the satisfaction of repairing or installing service and seeing the excitement of the customer of a job well done Great talk but cannot walk the walk Company seems great if you are drinking the Kool-aide and following their processes and guidance. Compensation used to be great until covid. Work life balance is awesome. But if you challenge the norm or go against the grain, you will find yourself stuck in a pattern. Challenge your leadership and you will find yourself not employed. Started too late If I had started the job before 2012 I would have been set, but after 2013 there was a new change every 6 months to a year on how to progress. Literally broke my back for the company, worked overtime, worked on-call, and trained technicians. They do nothing but move the goal post. This was probably a great job to start at in the late 90s early 2000s but now it will do nothing but take from you. Chicken with heads cut off, poor pay Sr. Leadership acts like chickens with their heads cut off. No idea what's going on, constantly fluctuating goals and moving targets. No room for advancement, they ghost qualified internal employees in favor of diverse external hires. Raises are 3% if you do ""outstanding."" Literally, 3% for being in the top 10%. This has created a culture where everyone works to the lowest common denominator. Peers are unbelievably lazy, but if you stand out your reward is more work for 3% instead of 2% for a raise lol. Not worth it. Good entry level job I really liked the people that I worked with. There are often raffles and giveaways to keep employees motivated. You must have thick skin as a billing agent as most customers that call are not happy about their bill and want to cuss you out. You are expected to take back to back calls with minimal breaks Point system terrible Pont system is terrible the once said you should care more about your bills than your customers bill. A lot of pressure you HAVE TO SALE a certain amount of products or they will be on your a*^*s all that telling you that they will fire you if you don’t sale working from home /freedom to work as a partner from home wake up, sign-in with 10 minute warm up/on ramp cycle, take calls from customers ,support as needed, identify sales opportunities as well as trouble shoot customer inquiries. Most enjoyable part of the job is to speak with a variety of customers from different backgrounds, race, economic etc. great benefits and ability to advance in company difficult customers depending on type of business segment you work with"
PayPal|" Productive , fun, but cut throat and political. Great company and enjoyed many positions that I worked in. Entry level expectations are easy to accomplish but lowest producer will always be let go. Team Leader and above will at some point be laid off. That’s what PayPal does. If you stay in one position for too long, you will be laid off. Women have a priority with promotions. Not great, not terrible. Your average customer service kind of job. On the phones all day with some bad calls and some okay calls. Great cafeteria, cheap drinks in soda machines, and free coffee. Definitely some perks to make you think it’s all worthwhile. Miserable most of the time The job itself is not very rewarding. Most calls you get are from angry customers. You have to interview 4/5 times just to get promoted to a different position. When they do train you in new departments, there is no pay raise. The only good part is the people you work with and the bonuses at the end of the year. Also you can work from home which is nice. Nice Internship Experience Work from home was flexible. Quite a bit of bureaucracy at times so project progress was slow at first, but makes sense for what it was. Overall decent SWE Internship. Work From Home Bureaucracy Sometimes 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Community, Inclusivity, Management cares What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Handling customers who do not understand what Government Sanctions on banking is and where to place the blame when violations occur on an account or transactions and if we do not comply with government policy we would be shut down. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Very inclusive as we are a forward thinking global company. There is a place for EVERYONE regardless of race, religion, social status, color, abilities. Work Life balance is always provided and encouraged. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Researching transactions to ensure 100% compliance Pretty good Work was stressful at times. Train8ng and management was good. Good perks. I would say paypal is a nice place to work. You have chances for growth. I enjoyed it Nothing but a Number You are nothing but a warm body in a chair, completing casework through a queue system. There is no thinking outside of the box and no creativity. You are completely judged on your production...because again you are just a warm body that's there to produce PayPal is cool Their CEO is tanking the place but the people are so dope. Just have to make sure you get your production done and it is remote so it works out. Not a bad place to work for 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? the people What is the most stressful part about working at the company? none. It was a great opportunity What is the work environment and culture like at the company? open and friendly What is a typical day like for you at the company? Busy. We put in the work Customer service rep I feel like they do not equip me to handle customers well. They are often frustrated with me. Partially because this company offers terrible service. Amazing place to work Started here as a CSR and have stayed for 10 years. Great place to work, incredible benefits, really positive and inclusive culture. Most of what I’d have to say about PayPal is positive, however the one negative I can point to is the constant change, if you are someone that doesn’t like change this isn’t the place for you. Systems, tools, processes and procedures are constantly being tweaked and changed so if you can handle change this is your place. Benefits, culture, and flexibility Constant change Great work-life balance and inclusive environment Amazing coworkers, interesting projects, constant challenges that drive personal growth and exploration of new ideas and knowledge. The work place is more than welcome and inclusive!!! Work-life balance here is great!!! Joined as a contractor Good people working at PayPal. Very chaotic and disorganized, lots of little details seemed to slip through. Originally was having contract extended to continue working as per management. Management wasn't told that my contract was instead being let go at normal expiration, I was notified 8 days before termination. Team was annoyed as I had many items on my plate, handed it all off to two people, still in good communication with managers and team. Overall organization is in disarray and trying to congeal their operations. Workplace Happy return is amazing place to work..,work not hard management team is amazing it’s the coworker in there that’s keeps mess up ..,it’s hard trying to work and you getting lied on or rumors getting spread on you it’s a very hostile environment I have seen good people quit because of this..,everything else is good just bad coworkers with drama every day Corporate politics Started out great when we were just growing out the team. Got progressively worse as we continued to scale. Incompetent managers and team leads who get promoted on favoritism not production. Pay is well below market average and this point and continues to get worse. Overall great, small tweaks needed as no place is perfect Spent over 5 years at PayPal and overall loved it. Was given many awesome opportunities probably would not have gotten anywhere else such as traveling across the world to train. The job is what you make out of it depending your department. Culture is great and for the most part they walk the walk. WFH flexibility, good culture, good managers. Compensation is below alot of the tech world. Numerous layoffs not based on performance. Interesting place to intern I was an information security intern, and spent time around many different people learning about how a major company operates. The managers overseeing me were often too busy to give much time to the interns, though. Fun workplace Great managers and team! PayPal has excellent perks and pay is on par. A little difficult to get promoted. Difficult to get promoted. Must be very good at writing and pay attention to the smallest detail or you will struggle. Tough Metrics, but good time off compensation PayPal is a great place to work if you enjoy working in a call center type of job. I was on the Venmo side. They don't focus completely on the phones so you are on chats and emails for part of your day as well. That was a plus for me. The metrics can be kind of tough, but management works with you to find ways to improve your stats. Overall PayPal is a decent company to work for if you enjoy or can tolerate customer work with people being very upset about their account. Fun workplace , promotes within easy and fast Management was absolutely great no judgment. Good motivators Great pay Gym available Quiet rooms No hassle You self manage Phones available . Manager . Vendors like chick fillet, diff food vendors m thru fri None One team Paypal is all about one team. Great resources for managing your life and work balance. Opportunity to grow and get experience in other departments. Get to work from home in Arizona. Not much micro managing, at least to me. They trust you to do your job. Give you resources to be successful on each call. Productive , fun, but cut throat and political. Great company and enjoyed many positions that I worked in. Entry level expectations are easy to accomplish but lowest producer will always be let go. Team Leader and above will at some point be laid off. That’s what PayPal does. If you stay in one position for too long, you will be laid off. Women have a priority with promotions. WFH (hybrid optional) Love PayPal. Love the benefits. Do the work, you will see financial results. I love the wfh aspect. It allows me to get back on track so many other areas of my life. Good company and better benefits, but hurtful layoff experience I worked at PayPal for 11.5 years and loved almost every minute. I worked in content management on a relatively small team. Even though we were a global team, we were like family. I only had 3 managers in the 11 years, which says A LOT about our team. The work/life balance was one of my favorite perks. I was never micromanaged. If I needed to take an afternoon off to take care of personal things, it was never an issue. As long as I met my deadlines and made my meetings, everything was golden. Other benefits included 401k matching, gifted stock shares, and a 4 week paid sabbatical for every 5 years of service. I also had the opportunity to travel to Dublin, Ireland more than once, such was awesome. I'd still be with the company, if I hadn't been effected by the layoffs in May of 2022. The only reason I won't give them 5 stars is because of how my layoff was handled. For how many years I devoted to them and how involved I was, it was very cold. I also believe in my heart (as do other members of my team) that I was targeted due to the fact that I used my most recent sabbatical (February 2022) to voluntarily check myself into rehab for alcohol addiction. They knew this because I chose to share it with my team leader, who was also a close friend. I was an integral part of the team, had never received an annual review that was less than ""meets expectations"" and had never once been talked to about my performance. I didn't even use company time to make myself healthier, which I very well could have done. Of course my director denied it on the separation call, but she is very conservative 1 Horrible The rules change so much, that the managers don't even know them, yet employees under them are expected to keep rules we never knew about and were not given proper expectations on it, and we get punished for not knowing them pretty good benefits too many to name Overall okay place to work Overall its an okay pace to work however management is horrible. Being forced to move positions without notice is completely ridiculous. There needs to be a more thorough process and completed before certain management is put in place. Benefits and culture Managers and growth Political culture Middle management lacked direction and empowerment. Senior leadership is complacent. Don’t work here if you seek career advancement support. A lot of effort goes into checking boxes at enterprise programs level but it’s smoke and mirrors. I love working here ! PayPal is a great company to work for .. definitely feels like family here! The pay is decent! They take me mental health very serious also. I would apply if I were you ! productive and fun workplace nice place. good salary. nice people. good office. managers are great. company has good cutler for men and women from my point of view. as well the flax ability wfh. Fun and inclusive Call center so strict attendance as expected but very fun and inclusive environment. Provided free drinks and lunch a lot of times. Okay pay could have been more considering they had night and weekend hours. Great Benefits/Friendly Environment The best employee benefits with an outstanding workplace culture. So many different opportunities allow you to work your way into a position you can thrive in and enjoy doing. Sometimes it does get clique depending on areas/leaders and there have been times where favoritism has been seen. But overall a majority of leadership want to help you become the best you can be and help you in getting where you want to be in the company. Great place to work Great place to work and benefits. Great pay abs team nights out. Work is stressful at times but rewarding brilliant facilities in the building, needs to be more work life balance. Plenty of training opportunities PayPal provided good resources for online and onsite training. The culture is mixed between two companies so it can be hard to fit into both. The tech stacks between them are also different. Work Ethics I was excited to get a job at PayPal. They need to upgrade their technology for a company this large they have to many manual processes. Senior management has no communication. When they do layoffs its poorly conducted and really makes you feel like you were just a number. I felt very strong about the way they ran this company but after going through their last layoff it was HORRIBLE [60 DAYS to get your severance) and they treat you like a number and not a person. You couldn't talk to anybody. Lost a lot of respect for this company Fun environment PayPal is a great company to work for. The leaders are supportive and they are adamant on work life balance. They strive to make work a place of enjoyment! Productive and a Team Environment Starting at PayPal I never felt left in the dark. From the interview process, to onboarding, and to my daily work flow it was all outlined for me and set me up for success. The operation tempo is high at PayPal but not one person is ever left behind. Not a company I’d ever recommend They play favoritism. Diversity is not valued. If you’re older or minority you won’t get promoted. They’ll continuously pass you over for promotions. Great benefits Great benefits buy hard to even move out of customer support positions. No openings or help moving to a department you are interested in. Stuck in customer support AMF customers can be nasty Benefits are awesome Lack of advancement or chance to move to a different department Great place to work Very Productive, energetic colleagues, great management, life and work balance is always taken into consideration, great culture over all. I am excited that I am building a future here with PayPal. no work-life-balance. Strong blame culture PayPal leadership does not support work-life-balance. They require people to work ridiculous hours and do nothing to try to reduce the workload. The currently leadership is fostering a strong blame environment. Total lack of ownership and sense of a team. People are moving up the leadership chain by stepping on others. decent pay no work-life-balance Good core values I appreciate that the company cares for its employees. I value the efforts that go into diversity and inclusion in the workplace. I was constantly challenged and had the opportunity to learn new things. worked in Finance and erp implementation Good job prospects and great to work with a diverse team. Cool to have multiple challenges while completing the project. Since there is also international currency in the mix, that throws additional challenges during the course of the project Productive , fun, but cut throat and political. Great company and enjoyed many positions that I worked in. Entry level expectations are easy to accomplish but lowest producer will always be let go. Team Leader and above will at some point be laid off. That’s what PayPal does. If you stay in one position for too long, you will be laid off. Women have a priority with promotions. Great benefits if you can tolerate call center H3ll I'm positive that other roles in the company that don't cause as much stress as call-center based customer service will make people more loyal to the company. But phone based customer support is too much to deal with at this company. I don't know if they've implemented changes to their knowledge management resources, but trying to find the answer to a customer's issue was like trying to find a rusty needle in a needle stack. There's no wrap time once a phone call is complete, which means you're going directly into a new phone call with another screaming customer. They also try and train you to stop using words like ""unfortunately"" and ding you on call reviews if you use any of those words, which results in mental strain trying to perform linguistic gymnastics while a customer knows you're BSing. But if you can tolerate it, the benefits really are pretty awesome. Free healthcare with a low deductible plan ($300 last I heard) is standard across the enterprise, free personal time days you can use whenever within the month they're given, PTO is generous and rolls over year after year, plus a large handful of other benefits make it worth it for some. Lots of perks, remote work for call center employees (during covid, don't know if that's still true), brand recognition, generous healthcare and PTO Low pay, Ridiculous call center environment, lack of useful resources, advancement can only happen after 1 year in current position, woke culture. 1 1 Good atmosphere, management is cool Working in Underwriting was nice because the management is pretty attentive and easy going. Work life balance was also a plus. My coworkers were great to work with because they were all willing to help each other out. Overall a good experience. Amazingly positive work culture and people A lot of politics and lots of reorganizations happen which leads to constant and unnecessary re-prioritization of goals and objectives. There seems to be a bit of geographic tug-of-war with respect to ownership and empire building... Another cloak-and-dagger Corporation with a shiny benefits package PayPal has great benefits and one of the most positive and inclusive work atmospheres I've ever worked for. The people are amazing and generally care for one another. The work however, is tedious busy work that doesn't live up to the expectations they hype you for. Management is very condescending; The term ""higher-brained thinking"" was often used by regional managers to describe the benevolent brilliance of their Corporate Overlords and explain-away employees with thoughtful concerns or questions during monthly all-hands meetings. You are told from the get-go that things ""are always changing"" and I think that's true; mostly because no one in leadership has any clue what the other leaders do. Leadership does NOT actively or meaningfully communicate with each other unless something is broken, and they are NEVER straight-forward with anything to their employees. PayPal brags about being innovative but only promotes the ideas of complacent yes-men they can directly profit from, and fails to achieve even basic functionality with its systems a lot of the time. Every system used is buggy and either half-built or half shut-down. Tech-issues keep people out of doing work for hours at a time, sometimes longer. The minute you think for yourself or question management you are in the wrong. The minute you catch up and get a sense of direction, everything changes, arbitarily and with no notice and little direction/resolution. Individuality is only celebrated here as long as it helps them save face. PayPal does a lot of excellent PR headlining stunts, but those are only for If you've seen Google's HQ, it's like a knockoff of that Hope you aren't afraid of the dark, because that's where PayPal will leave you Great culture, good wages but lacks job security Working at PayPal is overall a good experience. It is a call center style job so expect to be on the phones with customers and have metrics to follow/adhere too. Great environment It's been a great place to work and the overall culture is outstanding. I have a great work/life balance and respect that the company is involved in the community. Bait and switch Training did not prepare. Then the beginning of the job was a nice fair pace, then immediate changes threw everything out the window and the micro managing began. I feel I was misled the whole time. Training felt almost cultish when reflecting now. There’s so much information to learn and we spent probably 3 weeks just learning about how great paypal corp is Decent work life balance pros decent WLB exciting work great people involvement in social justice and charity cons poor pay in outside US locations undervalued outside US employees poor management misalignment between departments fantastic benefits! great place to work, been her a long time. before covid working in the building in chandler was ok... it all depends on your manager and if they like you .. Meeting expectations is very important Metrics are discussed regularly which can lead to micromanaging. All your activity can be tracked by your supervisor. It's a good place to work for since there is plenty of support, you just have to be mindful of your attendance and your performance. Great company with incredible benefits, but the growth structure is all talk and no action. The benefits make working here well worth it and everyone you meet is really friendly. Promotions are very difficult as you are competing with dozens and dozens of people all doing the exact same job, and you typically have to compete with agents located in other locations for promotional roles. Management out of touch Typical soul sucking call center job, but this one is significantly more difficult than most due to the monstrosity that is the PayPal system. My VERY reasonable accommodation was denied by HR so I had to quit. I guess the pay was okay comparatively but I'm not going to applaud making the bare minimum they can pay us without huge employee turnover while housing and inflation continues to go up. Run Going downhill fast and leadership is responsible. Get out while you can we’re all trying to leave. Lots of competition across company due to the toxic Culture I've learnt a lot. Outstanding people to work with, good work/life balance. The system is already running which make little hard to use new tools/frameworks. Strong code quality culture. Good Benefits Management was....well just management. Made a big fuss about caring about you then the second you share your personal hardships they turn a blind eye. I left the company due to personal hardships that were not as cared for. Again, could just be who I worked with benefits Typical large company I worked there for many years. Some teams had amazing supervisors that would help you grow and develop and soen had horrible supervisors. Advancement was a joke unless you answered the same 10 questions in just the right way. They did not accept your work history to prove you could do it. Benefits were amazing except for work life balance. If you didn't have an amazing supervisor, good luck getting time off if you didn't ask weeks in advance. After several years there I suddenly received a big pay increase. Turns out I wasn't making the same amount as my male counterparts. Great benefits If you weren't on a good team, best of luck to you. …Okay It definitely gets overwhelmingly busy majority of the time. The job definitely leaves you feeling mentally drained at the end of the day/work week.. 25 cent soda Soda is cheap and helps one get thru a very long day. If you ever have a sister that gets sick, you can not apply for a Fmla. Because a sister is not family. This is no joke This company with vision It's awesome being on board a company like PayPal and it's not easy. Often the company goals don't match with where we are in the moment. However, I appreciate the journey and I'm happy to contribute as a small part of the vision. I never knew it would be possible to have respect and appreciation for the company I work for. Corporate Structure that will underpay you I really wanted this to be my career but PayPal did not make that easy. I don't want to make this long. Basically I was promised promotions, raises, schedule flexibility and was given non of that. If you're entry level you can start here but if you're looking for a career you better have a degree and only settle for what you think you deserve. Once they set your salary/hourly and schedule that's it for you. Productive , fun, but cut throat and political. Great company and enjoyed many positions that I worked in. Entry level expectations are easy to accomplish but lowest producer will always be let go. Team Leader and above will at some point be laid off. That’s what PayPal does. If you stay in one position for too long, you will be laid off. Women have a priority with promotions. They lost focus along the way the company itself was really good at the beginning. However they neglected employees that had been with the company for many years. Although you must keep stakeholders happy you also must keep internal employees happy and foster a conducive work environment. They failed in this area. It's what you make of it There is no flexibility in hours worked, solid 40 hours every week and you have to be there on the dot. Management has to play a charade of caring for you while meeting their own quotas which made me feel as well as other coworkers, like nothing was changing or being addressed I learned a lot there but you could not pay me to go back Inclusive, good benefits but severely underpaid for work performed Pros: Very inclusive, good benefits, good culture Cons: Very demanding job, poor training, salary/hourly pay way too low for what you do, constantly being given more tasks/duties than original job description without appropriate compensation (""lateral moves"") One of the best jobs you’ll have in customer service. I have held plenty of customer service positions but the difference between PayPal and other places is the management & mentors. They truly include everyone and if you do everything you are taught or pick up along the way to appease your customers you will be just fine. I love the upwards growth that your lead can help you accomplish. Engaging empowering place to work PayPal is a great company on the world stage, they make life better for people and show they support everyone in multiple ways. They are honest and honorable in their dealings with employees and society. I love working for a company that supports businesses large and small, minority and majority. I love working for a company that recognizes that love is love, and humans do not fit in a binary. I love working for a company who ensures we are safe as can be; ensuring people sharing a workspace are vaccinated, and supporting them to work from home if not. PayPal encourages our wellness physically, mentally, emotionally, and financially. They are one of the best employers around, and I am grateful to have a chance to work here. Wellness days off, solid financial compensation, engaged leadership Some managers aren't stellar, we could use more diversity in leadership Not enough Unorganized and not enough pay . Customers are rude. They give you too much information to remember . Most employees that have been there a long time learned on site. All new hires are trained at home with too much information. Most senior employees are rude Excellent benefits Good pay and benefits are the best. My managers were very helpful and understanding. My job was very fast paced and policies change all the time. I was on the phones and metrics are very structured and bonus was based on your performance. Frequent reorgs Inspiring corporate vision and collaborative co-workers. However, frequent reorgs (some driven by McKinsey) leave heads spinning in product and engineering. A lot of work to merge previously acquired companies together remains to be done. Product discovery and development processes are a work in progress. Flex time and Global Wellness days since Covid Decent pay Nice people Poor internal documentation for onboarding new people, Product processes are ever changing, Product management is very execution focused. Minimal market research resources, Many engineering resources are remote/overseas which can lead to long days for product managers Supportive and lots of opportunities to grow Management is so supportive and cares about your well being. Plenty of opportunities to move up in the company. Great benefits and fun work environment. The people are golden and the culture is tops, no tools to do the job makes expectations impossible The bad: The roles, responsibilities, and job expectations are clear and the expectations are high BUT our abilities to COMPLETE our expected roles, responsibilities and requirements have been made completely unavailable. I don’t have any ability to do what I am expected to and I am held responsible for this inability by the goals being impossible to even try to meet. Team I’m responsible for duties that I can no longer do because of changes to tools Most positions are remote now due to the pandemic. Job can be extremely stressful mentally. Worked remotely which made it harder to decompress at the end of every shift. Made it hard to leave work at work when it constantly in your home. Job is particularly stressful due to the outrageous metrics in which you are upheld to. One disgruntled customer can cause your scores to come down making things harder on you. Wfh, Wellness Days, Great benefits Sedentary position, getting fussed out by users with not much time to breathe before the next customer interaction. Pretty good company. Great culture It’s completely remote. Pay could be better but great culture and great low cost benefits. I love the team huddles. Team leads are very supportive. Room for growth. Flexible and remote, good benefits Short breaks. Typical call center being attached to the phone for production. Job seems great at first but then you realize it’s a work load and b2b calls Back to back calls expectations are set to 5 mins per call 60 + calls a day the customer can’t call back within 2 days they expect first call resolution I would not work here if you’re not ready for unrealistic expectations. If you’re failing in your department the management don’t care to keep you around they rather replace you so just expect that Pto, paid holidays, overtime Short breaks Micro manage Metrics are unrealistic no job security Relaxed work environment if you're not on call with great management Very aligned management from top down. Low stress. Compensation lower than other Fintech companies. Didn't feel challenged, didn't feel ownership of product due to frequent project changes. Great benefits but large workload This company gave me a lot of the tools needed to succeed and amazing benefits all throughout my time there. Although, as you progress and stand out as a great employee you are given more and more responsibility that can become overwhelming. Great benefits Lots to know and back to back calls High stress level As AWF is not recommendable. Long work hours, no benefits Average workplace This workplace is average, although major factor to keep in mind is that it all depends on the team you have been assigned to. Mine was risk management and I can say that it was mediocre work Good work culture and benefits Good: - Work culture - Benefits - Supportive mentors and managers - Flexible work culture Bad: - Long hours sometimes and high pressure to hit goals, but it comes with the job and there is good support. Fun place to work with fun people and a cool environment. Though I was only at PayPal for a few short months, I found the colleagues I worked with to be very knowledgable and competent at their roles. Unfortunately, project hand-off documentation and procedures Office Environment Mgt. Turnover Good pay and benefits Good pay great benefits easy work remote from home and personable supervisors, incentives are given quite often hourly pay high for work you do but can be mentally stressful Good amount of PTO Productive , fun, but cut throat and political. Great company and enjoyed many positions that I worked in. Entry level expectations are easy to accomplish but lowest producer will always be let go. Team Leader and above will at some point be laid off. That’s what PayPal does. If you stay in one position for too long, you will be laid off. Women have a priority with promotions. Its really woke Good place to start out, really good learning experiences, room to move to other department's, internal mobility is supported. Pay is pretty low though, that could definitely improve Flexible schedule low pay 2 Great place to work Mangers encourage growth and internal promotions. Would totally recommend PP as a place to work. Managers listen to employees needs and react to help when needed. Lots of drama among staff members I was an admin and the other admins loved to gossip and could be very caddy. I wasn’t into all that so I kept away and out of it, because of that I didn’t socialize much with other admins unless it was work related. Good benefits and fair pay The admin team gossiped too much Great benefits, low pay Great benefits work from home. Lots of give ways. Horrible pay, no breaks only 30 min lunch. Answer calls to tell cx we cannot help all day. Constantly say, we are a user initiated system, we cannot do anything on your accounts only you can do this. Great benefits Low Pay, no breaks, 30 min lunch Experience Great opportunity for advancement. Many jobs are available to live up to if you want to track and move up. Bad case of seniority. If you haven’t been there a while others get opportunities that they aren’t qualified for before you Excellent place to grow PayPal has a very inclusive and safe culture which means you are always supported by others to thrive. You can be exactly who you are without hiding any aspect of your personality as advancement is based on merits only. The environment is very fast paced and you feel like you are part of every big change in the company which is growing very fast. Remote for now, good bonus, equity, healthcare Short breaks, low flexibility for hours I loved it here Great company culture with extremely supportive management that are truly committed to growth. Rate of pay was cool. Only issue that I had with them was the fact that my office was laid off due to some changes in the company. Despite that, PayPal was truly an excellent place to work. Work life Calls are back to back! Doesn’t pay enough for what’s expected. Micro managing even when it is from home. It’s ok but that is only if you like fast paced call centers sales targets only for the 5 % best sales people in the world During Corona PayPal increased the sales targets to a level which makes many people to look for other jobs. In Sales like sales should be it is a hard working environment, there is no empthay that sales tools always break up but you have to work always fine. benetits, stocks, wellness days, wellness activities very high KPIs, management, no empathy Overall, a great company, needs some improvement. I was well compensated for what I did, and the insurance and other benefits are fantastic. The tasks can be boring and repetitive, luckily in my department we were able to listen to music/podcasts to help pass the time. Management wants to move individuals forward, but unfortunately the senior positions are occupied and tend to always be occupied, so unless you are lucky, you may stay in the same position for awhile New metrics Very focus on meeting metrics but don’t care that many people working from home have you’re kids no flexible schedule. I was told to put my kids in day care from home to avoid them making noise in there on house keep in mind kids are kids toddlers can be loud sometimes Benefits Work from home lack of support and understanding Great job! Loved working here Best place to work! Perks and management are the best!! Love it everything was awesome. I would recommend this company to anyone looking to Advance their career Positive I really liked PayPal. It was a good experience. They really try to work with you. Training was great.. I really liked their approach to training. It builds on skills not everthing all at once. Unfortunately I was out sourced. Best company I have ever worked for I dont know how PayPal is today, but I worked there between 2014-1016. To this day I still brag about them to others I work with and always use them as an example. Other peoples experiences could very well be different. But for me it was a really great place. The atmosphere was great and happy. Windows were everywhere so it helped make you feel happy. People always had their desks decorated and the walls were decorated, it almost felt like being in kindergarten again. Silly I know but I loved it. There was several break rooms on each floor and they always provided free coffee and creamers to employees. They offered a lot of overtime especially around the holidays. It was easy to get too. You go into a website and choose what days and time you want and that was it. Just show up. You could also check the website for VTO (voluntary time off) no need for permission if it was in there you could take it, same with the overtime. We had 15 minute stand ups every morning with an hour meeting every day. Management was always willing to help if they noticed an employee struggling with anything, they were always well educated on how to help employees and they took the time to listen to you and your needs and figured out what to do. They own their own building and have a gym equipped with a trainer, and fully stocked bathrooms with showers and provided towels, a blow dryer and shampoo and conditioner and body wash. They have a great cafeteria with awesome food and cooks. Lots of giant fridges and lots of microwaves. They have a game room with pool (not a swimming pool), couches, computer To much to mention, refer to review. Nothing This review applies only to the Call Center CS aspect of the company Based on long term experience there, this is a good company overall that is currently operating under excellent corporate leadership. The employee benefits package is superb and PayPal makes an extra effort to follow their mission statement to be inclusive, collaborative, etc. In recent years improved entry level compensation has improved. If you are employed in the consumer/merchant direct customer service area, remember that a call center job is what it is, Time is money and you will be judged strictly on metrics, so if you can cut your call handle time without obviously not helping the customer, you will be rewarded. It you take extra care to help the customer, you ultimately will be gone. Expect to typically average about 6 months per supervisor during your call center tenure. Employee benefit plan and bonus/stock plans Meter your expectations - call center high employee turnover Great company with great people I worked at PayPal as a contractor for a year to assist with their PPP program. We primarily worked from home, and went into office on an ""as needed"" basis. I had great co-workers and management, which made the contract fly by. Amazing company PayPal is the best company I’ve ever worked for. The culture is awesome. Management is fantastic. I love everyone I work with. They are very reasonable with time off (they give us wellness days). They support all sorts of causes and always donate, awesome awesome company. Diversity and Inclusion for all Individuals at PayPal I work with some of the most amazing humans, and am grateful for the all around support my organization has shown me over several years and bumps along the way. There can always be improvements but I am very happy with my role within the PayPal network. PayPal stock grants, teammates are the best, I’m trusted by my employer, never micro-managed It’s tough to move into new roles Cares about employees, but your role is always shifting. I worked at PayPal as a Customer Assistance Specialist and my role changed 3 times in 9 months. The company has great benefits and pushes diversity hard which I loved. The constant moving around and lack of communication from management seemed to be the price to pay for these benefits. There was almost no room for upward mobility. Great benefits Constant role change Ok if you were the pet Not a great experience. I’ve actually heard of people legitimately getting PTSD from working there, and after my experience I can believe it. It was horrible Ok pay Elitism, no advancement, poor management"
Oscar Health|" Very Inclusive Work Environment. Because its a startup company, there are a lot of issues with structure and organization. I enjoy my team but the environment feels very unstable therefore I am reluctant to recommend this employer. Flexibility. The company culture is very inclusive. The work environment feels very unstable and disorganized 2 Fun and easy We got licensed thru company who helps and pays for licensing. Great time and they give you time during training to earn your license. Great environment, team atmosphere, providing lunch and many morale boosting activities 2 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Benefits Remote Work What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Constant changes High turnover What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Adjust to the changes, then once you get it, need to adjust again. Rinse and repeat. The managers have their favorites who they will choose for jobs. Empty promises. Terrible EHR. Micromanagement. 2 Like any other insurance company Think before you apply. If you’re ok with no training, terrible leadership, look no further. Disappointed that I left bad to worse. Leadership have no clue big refuses to allow team to contribute to make things better. Wfh, company paid benefits No one knows what they are doing. Great culture! The culture that Oscar embodies isn't only what every other company should adopt but also needs, in order to become a better employer for their employees. Oscar is doing things right as an insurance provider as well as an employer by trying to do their best to have the employees happy as well as free of burnout. Not every company is perfect, but Oscar is getting where it needs to be! Bad taste Work environment was unfriendly to the neurodivergent and frequently encouraged uncompensated out of scope work. Managers unsympathetic and don’t care about their patients getting covered medications. Christmas Gift Low pay for experience Production Ok place to work okay hours okay pay okay location. This company is a wonderful Place to start your career but I would not stay here long term or retire Lots of growing pains and poor management style. Management is not trained properly and all give different answers on certain situations. great pay but not worth it to deal with bad managers and rude clients and constant scrutiny of your phone calls and how you spend every second of your day. pay monitor everything you do, poor management styles Productive Great place to work. Co workers are always willing to assist. Leads always willing to meet one on one to give assurance as well. No micromanaging. Great company Not sure what is going on The workers are nice enough and the company is very inclusive. However, it seems like upper management lack direction. Projects and priorities are constantly shifting. Amazing Development Oscar has provided an amazing place to grow and develop your current skill set while ensuring you are learning new skills to further your career. Weekly reviews were nice Working st Oscar was not a good fit for my ethical values. I felt like they were more interested in saving money than providing care needed for its members. I felt they were biased, to certain groups of people. Lower management, the leads, were supporting of their immediate charges.9 4 stars What is the best part of working at the company? No micro-management at the side of the administration is something that not many companies do nowadays. Work-From-Home is something that actually surprises me from a company that is relatively young compared to others as they have their own technology as well as their own way of focusing on working on things that need to be worked on internally rather than leaving it to its own, overall, the company surely lives up to its motto ""It's a big effin deal"" in everything they do. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Working with operations, at times, they change their own policies and tend to try to throw you under the bus for things they decided on in the first place. Nonetheless, Oscar is good at giving you the option to ""save your tickets"" on everything you do with the teams so that things like this get avoided and accountability gets shown in the end. Oscar surely knows what its doing in the end, which is why this company will get farther and will really disrupt the healthcare world in this country :) Run! I worked here for 6 months remotely. The training is horrible. They throw you to the wolves and when you do something wrong you are reprimanded. No sense of time management. Very micromanaged. Working from home was good but the stress was not worth it. Tech Company with an Insurance Focus I think Oscar misses the mark on a lot of things. It's marketed as a company that is trying to restructure health insurance, but they miss a lot of key objectives in doing so. The training is inadequate. You pretty much have to train yourself and learn from facilitators who have no knowledge of or experience in the role you were hired to do. The workflows are constantly changing. While I understand that this is start-up environment, there should be more consistency in the basic job descriptions/responsibilities. Your leads will often tell you to refer to Confluence, a database that requires you to dig through several pages of information, just to find an answer to your question. There is absolutely no (and I mean NO) flexibility on last PTO and sick time. They require you to submit PTO two weeks in advance. If you have a last minute emergency, you will be penalized with their point system. This attendance policy is juvenile at most. I understand holding your employees accountable for their attendance, but life happens! They are a very liberal organization. I appreciate the inclusivity, but please know that you will be subject to liberal views on a daily basis. On the plus side, I like the remote aspect of the job. My lead is cool. Those are the only pros I really have. Remote work Benefits, time off, lack of training, unclear job responsibilities, ever-changing workflows, low pay Not what it used to be Good - Management takes the time to listen (although they can rarely do anything about concerns), typical corporate benefits - PTO, Sick time, 401k, mental health, bi-weekly compensation for non-exempt employees. Inclusive company, multiple ERGs. Bad-ish - still a newish company - training is not like it would be with a more established company. Many workflows are not clearly established. If you are able to take initiative and ask questions and learn as you go this would be a great fit. No set trainers. Seasoned employees are responsible for training new hires, without pay incentive. What they don't know, you won't know. Multi-tasking ability is a must, If you can't multi-task and work multiple workflows throughout the day probably not the best fit. Rigid scheduling. No flex times. Get ready to use PTO and sick time if you have any regular family/life engagements. Too high workload. Seems like every department is generally understaffed. Compensation isn't what it should (imo) be for the workload. Gone Corporate. Used to be a start up that was fun and exciting to work at. Feel like they scaled at too fast a rate and what was exciting is now stressful. Used to be inspiring work, even at the lowest position, is now just.a job that pays the bills. Micro-managing and shifted to a quantity over quality approach. remote work rigid schedules, poor training, poor compensation Fast Paced and everything changing Fast paced environment that requires you to always have a new project going. The workload is management most of the time but you have to be willing to multi task Great company to work for Great company to work for, it’s remote, great if you’re looking for flexibility. Workload is manageable and there’s advancement within the company. I would recommend. Benefits, Flexibility Pay could be better Complete chaos. Horrible perks. The good first. This is an inclusive company. They welcome all people. The think of themselves as a tech company, so a lot of all hands meetings are geared towards tech. There is a lot of corporate cheerleading. The pay is average. Now the bad. HORRIBLE PTO accrual. I mean, the worst of any company I’ve ever worked for. If you’re hourly, you’ll start with just 10 days off a year. This is the lowest of ANY health insurer or tech company. People are already quitting because of this. Training would be laughable if it hadn’t happened to me. They make you train yourself in just two to three weeks then throw you on the job with no support. Extremely busy because every department is completely understaffed. There are no flex schedules. You have a set time to work and that’s it. Forget this job if you have kids because you will have no flexibility for appointments or soccer practice. This place is full of young, intelligent people who are using it as a stepping stone to pad their resumes. It’s a shame. People are very resistant to other points of view. Management is just as new as everyone else so workflows are unclear and things can get pretty sketchy. Overall, it’s a low stress job, but not a place to have a career unless you have an advanced tech degree. The CEO is after profitability at the expense of employee well being. Otherwise it’s an average pay job with poor benefits which fits right in with people just biding their time until they find something better. In todays job market, that usually doesn’t take long. Fabulous Culture; Opportunity to Advance! Oscar has an amazing culture and an open door to apply for other positions throughout the company, they encourage it. It is newer insurance carrier so the content is a bit messy at times, but I’d say your experience also depends on your department and management in that department. They may not have it altogether but definitely a company worth working for. Compensation is also up there! Compensation, culture Work life balance Unprofessional/Unable to manage basic call center metrics This place started out good and the culture was geat. Things changed after Covid and they turned into a typical micro managing type of company. The only problem is that their leadership lacks experience. They are unable to manage metrics/goals for their employees based on call/work volume. They want you to do the work of 2 or 3 people with no increase in pay and will fire you if you can't perform to their unrealistic goals. They can't even tell you if a holiday will be a paid/time off holiday until a few days before, giving no regards for an employees time and planning before the holiday. The company needs new and experienced leadership to thrive. If you want to do the work of 3 people and get paid the same then this is the place for you! Very Inclusive Work Environment. Because its a startup company, there are a lot of issues with structure and organization. I enjoy my team but the environment feels very unstable therefore I am reluctant to recommend this employer. Flexibility. The company culture is very inclusive. The work environment feels very unstable and disorganized 2 No flexibility No flexibility. On phones all day talking to patients or hospitals. Have to log in and off for breaks and lunch. Pay is fair. Not what I expected. Here for now. 2 Care guide It’s ok. The position is not ideal. Don’t apply if you don’t want to be on the phone all day getting yelled at about everything related to the member’s health plan. It’s a job that pays the bills for now. There’s better jobs out there. Just here for the time being. 3 Promising but no concrete training and very confusing and unorganized, not sure if longevity is possible. Some people are very unprofessional, no flexibility on schedule, no clear explanation of role and workflow. Unorganized. There is no concrete training program and training ended half the time it was supposed to be. Really Nice in the Beginning Oscar Health is a great starting place to get experience in the medical field. They’re a fairly new insurance company, started in 2012 and they’re still working out a lot of kinks internally. As someone that had worked with health insurance for about a decade, from my training to my time taking calls, you can tell who has never worked with health insurance, and who has. Unfortunately, a lot of the trainers, supervisors and “leads” seem to have little to no background in this field. Their set up really well for remote work and have a seamless WFH system in place. It was impressive. The pay is decent. The role was difficult at times, call after call and as a Care Guide you’re answering any and every question members can think of—pray they don’t ask for a supervisor, because they’re never available and never call members back. Their navigation knowledge base is huge and it can take time to find an answer or receive and answer from a supervisor. Company culture is great, pay not so much. Nice people in management. Very low pay compared to other companies. Company seems to be scaling quicker than it is prepared for. Not enough employees to handle workload. Not enough managers to assist with the frequent issues that arise. Benefits Pay. Not a bad place to work Can’t speak for the office setting but I like working from home. They train you and encourage you to ask questions. Good work life balance but sometimes you may have to work overtime. You will learn more than one workflow which can be a little overwhelming. Calls are busy but great call center Loved the call center. They make it very easy for you to do your job. However it’s a very busy environment so be prepared for that. The calls were back to back during my time here. good learned alot, good benefits, remote work is always a good thing. vneigends njfemfwldw eneie vwnif i enjoyed my experience for thr most part u should think to apply Excellent Benefits Oscar is one of the best places to work given the current job market. They have robust benefits to employees and attempt to give fair pay where most companies fail to do so. There is a large disconnect between departments so it can feel like work sometimes gets stuck in the pipeline, as different departments have different goals and priorities. You also wear a lot of hats in the associate position, which makes it more effective but also a lot more tiring. Overall Oscar is a safe and inclusive place to work with its own pitfalls, it has less pitfalls that most companies and way less difficulty being organized than clinics. Excellent Benefits, Good Hours, Great Training Department conflicts, emotionally tiring Poorly managed and too left of center, I mean way left of center Nice co- workers but the direction of management is all over the place. They are really a knee jerk reaction company that places themselves ahead of the employees Unlimited PTO Critical unsupportive environment Micromanagement of jobs assigned No clear cut rules on anything, changes constantly, without notification Endless forms and surveys yet no concerns about patient care Pto Poor management Leadership is dellusional and sociopathic As an engineer, I was worked until complete burnout ensued. Leadership likes to waste time with NBC news/Highschool like talks about social issues, meanwhile they are the most elitist sociopaths one will encounter whose only purpose seems to be to virtue signal and waste time. My peers were great, loved working with the lower tier engineers but they too were all burned out after awhile. The C-level leadership needs to get flushed and this might be a decent place to work. Cant think of one..sad as it is to say Could write a seven part novel series, starting with the c-level cast I wouldn't recommend this company to anymore They were very unprofessional from start to finish..waste of interview time ..a questionaire that had nothing to do with the job descriptions and the staff was not professional and respectful of someone's personal time . Pay Everything Varies Company overall is good. Current upper management is lacking. Advancement for certain demographics seems to be less likely than others. Once upper management is adjusted I would fully recommend Great pay for the region. Great benefits. Great training and culture Upper/middle management is lacking and biased towards certain demographics. Favoritism is evident I love Oscar Health I love Oscar Health insurance. I love the environment, benefits, and the people. You really do feel like you are making a difference and helping members with difficult situations. Oscar cares about mental health and genuinely cares about making sure your life is not all about work. Opportunities for advancement is there but can be challenging because there are so many smart and amazing people with the company. Creative and professional work environment! I love working at Oscar health. They know how to create an environment condusive to creativity and treat you like a professional. My manager is supportive and encourages my growth. Pay and great people Low 401k match I call it One bad dream If you are going to be working fully remote be prepared to pretty much learn on your own. Their go-to answer for teaching yourself is by accessing CONFLUENCE on their portal. Their go-to answer for learning their phone system ""practice with your cell phone, try calling the 800 number from your cell and practice all the features."" Training that is taught virtually is not much helpful. You will also work around Arizona team's time (if you live outside of AZ.) For them, it's all about creating tickets and it's more like an assembly line of them. You will be told your case load will be between 25-30, just to find out that the rest of the team has anywhere between 30-60 cases. none, if you read all the other reviews, most of them will state ""food"" as the pro. That should automatically tell you something! being fully remote and not enough training given Fun place to work and they value employees. Great culture, perks, and smart people. Loved my team and the old location in the pick building. Moved to Tribeca and the office is great and huuuuuge!! Location is boring though! Free lunch, free healthcare, fully stocked kitchen, numerous perks They took away the smoothie station, cut back on bereavement days, and wellness days. Lack of communication between departments. Terrible Micromanaged call center with high turnover. The metrics are also impossible to stay on top of since they're always changing. Oscar claims to give you room to grow but the metrics make it impossible to qualify for other roles. Don't bother with this company unless you want to be overworked, trapped and fooled. None No way to grow, members are upset all the time because the coverage sucks, management is incompetent and cliquey. Bait and switch company They lure you in and then switch you to phone intake. Horribly managed company that doesn’t care about their members or providers in their network. They overwork their processors and move you all over once you’re proficient in their systems. Can’t keep employees. Work from home and base pay is good Horrible management, lies to you about what you’ll be doing. Very Inclusive Work Environment. Because its a startup company, there are a lot of issues with structure and organization. I enjoy my team but the environment feels very unstable therefore I am reluctant to recommend this employer. Flexibility. The company culture is very inclusive. The work environment feels very unstable and disorganized 2 Great healthcare company! Great place to work! Good pay. Awesome benefits and perks. Management and supervisors were very approachable and open to ideas and very understanding. Gained an incredible amount of knowledge regarding healthcare plans and how they work. 6 5 No micromanaging and they value quality over quantity Been working from home as a concierge for 9 months now. I take my time when doing my job to ensure I do the job right and my work is appreciated. Sometimes the calls are back to back but the pay is good, the bosses don’t nag and there’s lots of overtime available. Also, there are always positions being offered so promotion is attainable. As long as you hit your bullet points on every call, which are all lines it for you in a rubric, you will succeed and get your merit increase! Work from home 11 4 One of the best companies I’ve been with several workplaces, and this is so far one of the best work cultures I’ve had the pleasure to experience - PTO was given after earned, managers were understanding and willing to compromise, and the company is there to help you and grow with you. I wish I did not have to leave due to family health and my health from the pandemic - an amazing place to work. Management, Pay, Benefits, work culture Calls can be emotionally draining It was okay I started working at Oscar health in the beginning when it had customer service in soho. It was stressful. There was a divide between the customer service and other employees Free food, unlimited pto, benefits Stressful, work through lunch Start up Oscar is a great place to work. I really enjoy the atmosphere and the people I work with. My managers are very supportive and help me when needed. Start up company atmosphere. Mostly Monday-Friday morning schedules. Work from home Used to be a good place New leadership seems to care only about making a name for themselves at the expense of others. Willing to step on anyone and take credit for their employees work. Higher ups turn a blind eye. Stressful and not worth the pay Oscar will stress you out for $19. They require so much training, one on one meetings, but refuse to give you a pay increase and if they do it’s only 1% raise and that’s based off a metric only they will understand because the rules change EVERYDAY! I was told that I was doing a great job yet I didn’t get a raise because of their rating scale. Upper management barely know anything and your hard work is not appreciated here...I promise! Will hire you at entry level Stressful workloads not worth the pay!!! not recommended Inspiring CEO and great company mission. Work culture of gaslighting, gossiping, shifting goals and rewards, factory mentality. They push you until you break. They say they care but their actions contradict that. work life balance management is the worst Plenty of perks but not enough support They had a pretty agressive campaign to hire new staff for member services department. Unlimited PTO, above industry standard pay, free snacks including cold brew, free Oscar gear and you could order workspace tools --such as a standing desk. The work was demanding, as a start-up the protocols are in constant flux. When policies changed, our department often bore the brunt of it. Unlimited PTO was taken away from Member Services and at one point our department was shuffled off to an entirely new building outside of the beautiful headquarters in lower Manhattan. This did not improve morale within the department amongst my coworkers. Management was for the most part effective in terms in seeing each person as an individual and looking out for you. Some of the senior staff were more successful at that than others. There were plenty of opportunities for advancement since the company was growing at a rapid rate, however very little change of switching to another role outside of Member Services. Even with all of the perks, I was not happy working there. It wasn't the right fit for me. Free lunch, free gear, free cold brew and snacks Healthcare, unlimited PTO was removed Awesome Company , Inclusive , Transparent Leadership Started at Oscar in 2018 was immediately impressed with the inclusive, fun culture. My position has always been work at home but I enjoyed going into the Temp office , Free snacks , coffee , drinks often free catered lunches , bagels etc. My day to day is very busy and as with any customer facing position there are metrics that need to be met . Due to being ""a start up"" there are often changes to processes , workflows and even program changes . If you cannot adapt quickly to change or need hands on oversight this may not be the right place . I was encouraged by manager to seek out a leadership position . Plenty of room for growth if you want it . I have worked for insurance companies since 2001 and this company is the first one I am not ashamed to admit I work for an insurance company because Oscar really does care . Inclusive culture, fun office, work at home (even before Covid) Production metrics are somewhat unreasonable. Relatively new, but enjoying the environment The first thing I noticed about Oscar is that there seems to be a lot of internal promotion. Many of the leaders I have interacted with started out in lower or even entry-level roles. The average competency of the people I interact with is noticeably higher than my previous job and the atmosphere is much more positive, so I really don't have any complaints about my job for the first time in a while. There's always something to do here, and a significant amount of it is NOT busy work. As a somewhat young company, there still seems to be a lot of opportunity to make significant impact on the core processes. I like the pace but it's probably not a job for lazy people. Positive atmosphere, room for creative problem solving Minimal training Great job, great management, competitive pay I have been working at Oscar Health for a year and a half now and I have loved it. I started in a customer service role and I was actually surprised by how much they pay new employees. Additionally they offer really good benefits. While working at the office all employees were often treated to free lunches and other nice perks. Management encourages team building and they are frequently praising staff for hard work, this appreciation helps make even difficult work days feel worthwhile. They are also open about how they are supportive of identities, for example the office has gender-inclusive restrooms so that everyone can feel comfortable. Getting promoted from within is highly encouraged, you can apply for a new position after just 6 months. My manager even gave me tips that helped me during my interview to get promoted. Due to Covid most employees are working from home which I really enjoy. Managers still make sure to check in frequently to make sure everyone has what they need to be successful. I would definitely recommend this job to anyone who enjoys working with customers. Easy to get promoted, good management, high pay N/a Tech company with a very dynamic environment Overall job was decent. A lot of work but nothing too stressful. Lacked career development and growth opportunities. Typical day at work was just getting through as much as you can. Great company but needs help with training new hires Care guide is the face of the company and the front line employee that interacts most with the customers that call in on a daily basis. The training is 4-5 weeks of mainly powerpoints and learning modules that do not do the best at preparing new hires for the hectic nature of high volume calls. There is a chatroom for help from experts but can take some time to get a response. The internal resources are at your fingertips but the search function can turn up pages and pages of documents to search through to find the answer you need. Great people and management, fair pay, currently WFH until July 2021 Training for care guide needs more time and more in depth preparation for the role A start up that has taken over the health care/tech industry Such a wonderful, relaxing place to work. They care about the well being of the employees. The remote work is great, they care about mental health. The office is like google offices. Laid back, with lots of break out space, and so much fun. I learned so much starting as a temp and getting hired perm. The people were a pleasure to work with. Free lunch and events Oscar Health Insurance Best job I have ever worked for. Everyone in the company fully supports you, and cares for your well being. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this company. Don’t make a career out of it This is a startup tech based health insurance company. Although I think its an amazing concept, the individuals that are running it from the ceo down to call center is what made me unhappy. They are not open to feedback even though they ask for it. It was a horrible experience and you have to do way to much sucking up to even get promoted. Super high case loads Super busy all the time but great team leads. Case loads are too high. Great benefits! Company appreciation is demonstrated all the time. Company needs to hire more CM’s Great team leads and coworkers High case loads Worst place ever If I could give no stars that would be too much. If you are not already friends with management you will get nowhere they only fully support the LGBTQ community they do not give raises like they should people who have been there 2 and a half years are still making 19 dollars per hour they are not fair in their quality grading metrics on the phone calls but they tell you when your hired that it’s not traditional call center when it is exactly that Starting Pay Bad management and open favoritisms PSTRAT is a clicky high school cult Discrimination and EEOC nightmare!! The people strategy team is a clicky High School cult full of inexperienced human resource individuals who know nothing about policies or the law and do not back the employees concerns. They all know each other, protect each other, and cover-up all of the illegal things they are doing. The people team is by far the most corrupt bunch of people ithebuilding Very Inclusive Work Environment. Because its a startup company, there are a lot of issues with structure and organization. I enjoy my team but the environment feels very unstable therefore I am reluctant to recommend this employer. Flexibility. The company culture is very inclusive. The work environment feels very unstable and disorganized 2 Run away as if you were on fire. No raise in 2 years despite record revenues, weak leadership and denied opportunity for advancement. My interim manager actually prohibited me from applying for a different role. None Broken promises, chaotic office environment, In-house IT is always broken in some way. 4 Poor workplace Power tripped managers unqualified managers high school environment who is most popular back stabbing untrusted favouritism waste of time and 2 faced management 3 Open environment and opportunities for change in roles Open workplace, no offices Bagel Thursdays Surprise events Open to suggestions on improvements and enhancements Opportunity for change Wide variety of schedules, may not get your first choice and may have to work weekends Have to work almost all holidays Great company Innovative company with brilliant employees that genuinely care and believe in the work they are doing. Challenging environment yet friendly. Work here if you want to grow professinoally. Management is clueless The company is more like a dysfunctional kindergarten, they suck at managing people, dont recognize the people working hard for them, they like their favorites Fast paced environment/great place to work Open Enrollment is a chaotic time in this place, but to make up for it, the company supplied snacks and food. Due to Open enrollment though, management was hard to reach, meetings that took place regularly were almost eliminated. Before the end of 2019 the attendance/bereavement/PTO policy had been dramatically altered, it went from being two weeks for the death of a parent to a single day. Worst Work/Life Balance Imaginabld I went in with so much hope for this job. Not only do we fail our members, constantly. The company has cut our benefits in the most absurd way ever. 1 hour sick time, accrued every 30 hours. PTO is awful. Their paid bereavement only includes “immediate family”, which they define as only spouses and dependents. So if your parents or siblings, or grandparents who raise you die...you are SOL Typical micromanaged call center As a former concierge team member I can say that Oscar has some good qualities. I’m enjoyed the diverse culture.. their accommodations to employees with disabilities, the casual work environment and food accommodations and game rooms were really nice. Also daily stretching, meditation rooms and the occasional on site counseling if you chose to participate. But make no mistake that this is your average everyday call center environment. You can expect adherence be a major part of your metrics and being outside of adherence will affect your pay raise opportunities during review time. There is also a very strict point system that you can be written up and fired over. You also have to wait 6 months for points to fall off. This also affects your ability to advance. They give you a 3 minute grace period and anything beyond that equals and occurrence. If your able to work in your typical metrics based micromanaged environment and being late or having reasons to leave early aren’t an issue for you then you’ll be fine... also if your wrapping up a call and it’s taking too long expect to have someone come behind you and tap you on the shoulder to ask what your doing... call volumes are very high during open enrollment and one on one feedback is minimal... more like they’ll email your stats to you and send your whole team a list of everyone’s performance so if yours is a little less than par everyone will know. Typical call center... Fun environment and great place to learn. Fun and relaxed office environment. If you work hard there are a lot of opportunities to grow and work on different projects. Work hours are flexible but workload is pretty high. Not ready to make a difference in healthcare but on the way Pay and maternity / paternity benefits are great. They have a once a month thing where they ""Surprise and Delight"" the building (Popcorn, lunch, petting zoo, krispy kremes, etc. They always try to do something new). There are a lot of great people there, but as with every company there will always be someone that you're not incredible fond of. Oscar is very diverse in color, gender, shapes, genders, and disabilities. Its probably the most diverse place I have ever worked and they should be really proud of this. The CEO Mario is an amazing human being who takes things to heart and really wants Oscar to make a difference in healthcare. They aren't there yet but once they're more established, I can see them having more impact. I would really like to see Mario have someone at the Tempe location manage the building with his vision. They are either to quick to change or too slow to change. I literally heard 10 different kinds of workflows within a week because some new piece of information was found out and the entire building had to change how things were done. Which ultimately meant that it was almost never done right because everyone was confused. Unfortunately, Oscar has had some bad internal history which has caused other factors in the building to change too slow. They always asked for feedback from a manger level and actually took that into consideration. Sebastian is great. Many popular faces around his level talk about accepting feedback but take little action to make it happen unless they receive attention that helps promote their PR. Some really important things A good place to work but improvements are needed Oscar is what you make it. As someone who has worked multiple roles within the company I have seen the good, bad, and ugly. Major issues with management, they do what they like and promote how they choose based upon their feelings. Oscar could be a fantastic company if management would change. Oscar should also stop hiring externally for roles that could easily be filled by internal candidates. Proceed with Caution The benefits and pay are good. The people are great, management however is horrible. Training isnt what it used to be, and the company has forgotten how to value their employees. Proceed with caution and watch you back. Would NOT recommend Unless you graduated from an ivy league school stay away.... The turnover rate is rather high, management is a pure joke, and a majority are there for an image not to do a job. And the discrimination is not hidden well if at all. HR Department/Other Departments The HR department has to do a better job on collecting information when it comes to allegations from individuals instead of reacting have to take the proactive approach as to many times they side with the accuser opposed to the accused. As far as other departments to detached from other departments no communication between departments which can cause conflict with individuals amongst departments Oscar is a wonder start up health insurance company. See Comments about departments n/a I dont have one at this time I was in the call cente i was on a concierge team working with clients from NY and TX and other areas. No review to give Scare tactic work culture This company loves to say they are transparent, inclusive, and fair opportunities for advancement. In the 2 years there I have noticed they do not advance people unless you kiss up to the leaders, let them think for you, and do not challenge leadership. If you mess up once, you are held to that mistake the whole time employed with them. They are as transparent as mud. New leaders are shocked when they come in to find out their new subordinates are in fear of losing their job, afraid to speak up, and do not feel compelled to share ideas or thoughts. Their pay is decent but pay raises is only 1% after a year and that is if you qualify based on reviews from management. If you have a leader you are not 100% with on all levels, you may be at risk for no pay raise or promotion. They also like to change workflows non-stop and expectations and do not give raises for the elevated expectations and performance. Millennial Company They are concerned about progressive issues and how the health care industry is affecting people. So I always feel part of a team that tackles hard issues while enjoying food trucks on campus with kombucha on tap. Claims Absolutely a great company that applauds diversity and inclusion. Great pay and benefits. Lack of training in some departments leaves you frazzled. One of the leads is more of a cruise director concerned about crock pot meals vs really helping an employee out. For the rest of it a great place to be. good Overall easy going. Show up on time and do your job and you will be fine. You have to be able to handle change. Oscar is constantly changing by the minute. Terrible Run don't work here they will tell you one thing then do another, management is terrible hr is even worse if you value your sanity you will find someplace else to work Free lunch Stressful Very Inclusive Work Environment. Because its a startup company, there are a lot of issues with structure and organization. I enjoy my team but the environment feels very unstable therefore I am reluctant to recommend this employer. Flexibility. The company culture is very inclusive. The work environment feels very unstable and disorganized 2 Good coworkers. Good Benefits. All in all a good experience. The exceptions being that I was a permanent hire for a sales department that was abruptly outsourced in June 2019. Also, I have extensive previous Senior related health insurance sales experience, that really would have helped in a new sales department, in Senior related enrollment, launching in Aug 2019, but that was ignored I think, ironically, due to my older age and favoritism. Life experience can be sensed by Seniors. I should know. I am one. 12 Great Culture Oscar offers great culture but little advancement opportunities. Upper Management is great but the team leads seem to care more about numbers than their teams. Survey scores and turn around rate reflect that. Company events Favoritism with management. 5 1 Would not reccomend this company to anybody Oscar is cut throat ,you get many many disgruntled members on phone per day.or emails,etc management is very unprofessional, While working one Saturday had a disgruntled ex employee come and threatened the site,had to call the police to make leave, a screaming match on the sales floor btwn manager and ex employee....these things were commonplace Did fun food things Everything was a con! Tech Driven Health Insurance Company Care guides interact with members via calls and messages. Health insurance industry training is provided. Some management is fantastic, others are not. No dress code. Snacks provided. Very fun at times. Care guides cannot go to the bathroom in between breaks. Very little work-life balance. Candid ad hoc feedback used to be coveted but company is going in a direction where they don't want it unless it's asked for. Management changes and reorganizations are constant - some good and some not. Helping members is extremely rewarding. Good pay for entry level employees. Inorganic company policies have historically shown to result in injury. Toxic company Horrible Company and a TOXIC work environment.. No chance for advancement and you're fed LIES LIES LIES This company is very clickish-- If your Not apart of the click including the leadership click then you don't stand a chance... RUN FAR FAR AWAY from this company.. I wasted my time there!! $18 a hour Experiencef or NOT Too many to list Google-like Work Environment Great company to work for overall. They’re constantly changing even when it’s not needed which can be frustrating. There’s essentially two jobs you have when working at Oscar since they are a start up. In addition to your job, you also need to be flagging any system issues/tech trends which can be a bit much. High volume calls, hard to distinguish between roles, easy advancement. Oscar Hub Oscar Hub does not allow you to have a work life balance. They are not EEOC compliant. Employees are afraid to lose their job for the unknown. You must be popular to succeed vs your work ethics. Colorful Building, Game room which you are rarely able to use. Not eeoc compliant/ discrimination/slander/ harr Ramp up for open enrollment Oscar ramped up for open enrollment. They hired a large sales force for 6 months only. Employees got training to pass licensing exams and training on how to sell the product. Excellent Company Culture Best Company you could ever work for! Excellent company culture. Great compensation. Management that actually cares. Tons of company perks, including unlimited PTO. Micro managers... Horrible management If you have a healthy brain, you'll bypass this place! The most micromanaged place I've ever seen. Once in they try to force their values on you (transgender restrooms, transgender week, etc.. very anti-religion values... if you have religious values... you're like the enemy... so much for non-discriminating EEOC environment). They push FAR LEFT opinions down your throat. IF you insist on working at Oscar DO NOT GO INTO THEIR CONCIERGE SERVICES DEPARTMENT - You'll get micromanaged all the way to when you can go to the restroom (they call it keeping in compliance)! Advancement is based on who likes you (in management) and NOT by whether you can do the job! IF they think you're attempting advancement to get away from concierge services they will use that to KEEP you in concierge services and control you AND YOU WILL NOT be allowed to advance - FACT! This COULD BE AN EXCELLENT place to work if they'd get in COMPLIANCE with EEOC rules! How they get away with their style of management is beyond me! CLEAN UP MANAGEMENT and you'd see a whole different company! Worker bees are GREAT but unhappy! Health bnefits are good. TERRIBLE Management, NON-EEOC Compliant, Executive Management turns their heads while good people are being abused by their micro-managers! Great customer service experience. Very Busy. As a start up you can only imagine that changes take place rapidly. As a member service rep you will get the brunt and negative comments of those changes, but you can learn a lot. Free lunch Very little job security. Great Start up first Great first start up job. Learned a lot, smart group of people, innovative, pushing the envelope culture. Fast paced... loved it. Competive team environment, always pushing to do your personal best, rewarded financially for success, fair and equitable magmnt, best and diverse group of people, from gender to age to ethnicity. Thanks Mario.. free food, licensed in 3 states, fair magment, flex schedule fast paced, constant on toes Great place to work The workday at Oscar is busy. It's a competitive work environment. The casual dress option is great. The most enjoyable part of the job is the start up environment brings something new everyday. Not much time to get bored. Casual dress. productive place to work Oscar had a great work environment it was also very cultural. I've learned allot while working here it also helped me to grow as an individual. Also learned allot about healthcare. Excellent Culture Great company! Extremely cultured. Excellent benefits. Great pay. Opportunities for advancement. Company grew extremely fast. Management Team are well trained. Leadership promoted their friends Leadership was inexperienced and unsupportive. I loved my job but all the benefits are useless when your leadership constantly harasses and targets people they don't like. I will never reccomend anyone I actually like work for this employer because I value my friends. The New York leadership should evaluate the events of the Tempe environment. Sending leaders from New York to Arizona occasionally does nothing to address the poor culture and lack of experience your Concierge Nurse Team Leads currently harness. #DoBetter You help people acheive health goals Leadership will target good hard working employees until they quit Impartial Great experience great people great work life. free beer, free food,monthly company outtings, yearly company trip, Free gear, interesting work, not easy but worth the time to learn. Productive and fun workplace Highly recommended place of work if you are self-motivated. Very diverse environment with opportunity for advancement. If you can think outside of the box it helps. Free lunches Not hiring permanently High volume call center with no leadership As a new employee, trainers and managers talk up how great of a company Oscar is. As time goes by, expectations change without notification, benefits are taken away, and write ups occur without any prior notification Good benefits write first, talk later approach Double edge sword This COULD be an amazing place to work, however, they get in their own way. The top leadership staff are unprepared to make valid decisions that affect the floor staff. When hiring for advancements within the company 90% of the time its done unfairly and based of favoritism. Some jobs you interview for, others they just choose people they like. And even if you do interview, if they already have their minds made up then you're just wasting your time. The staff is great, friendly, the pay is nice, PTO and sick days (although you have to accrue those, and that's stupid). Drinks to keep your palette moist. Treats often. Management is hit or miss, more often miss though. great benefits and culture Advancement is hard if your not friends w/ management, or a loose lipped tattle who rats everyone out for everything."

LexisNexis|" Productive and fun workplace. Learned new things and the co-workers are so cool and helpful. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting new projects and teamwork processes, and performance outcomes. 2 Excellent innovative company I thoroughly enjoyed my time with LexisNexis and the opportunities they provided to develop innovative solutions for the industry. I highly recommend them to anyone seeking a challenging and rewarding work environment. Good people, easy work The people who work here are some of the nicest people I’ve ever met. They have reasonable expectations as far as your daily progress and the workload is not overbearing. Used to be great Suits in NY killed it and made poor decisions that have tanked the company. Innovation is gone. Talent is gone. Chasing shiny objects and lacking any substance or true vision anymore. Great place to work LexisNexis is a great place to work. Very stable. Good work life balance and very nice coworkers. Technologies you work on can very greatly by team. My work on old Java or cutting edge Python, Typescript Products or Go. Decent Pay And Benefits But Lacks Inclusive Culture I entered with a group of 8 people in my training. Most of my training left within 2 years of finishing training. Most people leave because of the way they are treated and the unrealistic expectations for customer service especially based on customer pay scales. Pay and benefits are decent, but management and legal are shady. I left due to harassment and they continue to tell companies to not to hire me. Save yourself! Interesting Work, Good Compensation/Benefits Work is technically challenging and you are contributing to the Rule of Law globally. Pay/Benefits are competitive with the market. Hard work that product good results is rewarded. Good people who are helpful and don't play political games. Productive and learning new tasks daily. Great place to work. Recommend applying for a position within the company as you will be in a cultural setting with diversity and integrity. Overall great company to work for. Great pay and people Stressful and busy Political, no growth, smoke and mirrors White privileged at its finest, rule of law only when it serves the company. horrible processes, slow to change, conversations no action.poor management Good management, people, culture, middling compensation and advancement Upper management seems passionate about the company, while my previous manager was great. Good co-workers who help out when asked. Company is understanding for employees under rough circumstances such as bereavement or illness. Job advancement isn't great, as it often feels like it takes too long for internal employees to be promoted, while compensation is low for the industry. In summary, you pay for the good work environment with your salary. Lots of dinosaurs Only people smart are at the top. Lots of randoms thrown throughout the mix. Hopefully no one ever decides to join. Very shady stuff. Hope y’all listen. Used to be great place to work in This company has has several business units, the one I worked for is legal and news unit. It used to be great place to work for, but has changed and the culture went down hill. It’s very toxic environment to work in, nasty no clue management and no realistic goals. They manipulate numbers so they look good, and no customer focus. Great pay, but don’t let your guard down This felt like a dream job at first, but do not trust the supervisors. There were times I was given busy work or not given any work at all, and this was later used against me. The more independence and freedom you are given, the more cautious you should be. Keep very careful track of your hours in multiple formats, especially any times that management tells you to go home early on certain holidays, as they may later accuse you of misrepresenting your hours despite having instructed you to do so. The great salary and ability to work independently may feel great at first, but don’t get comfortable. Supervisors will claim to advocate for you while undermining you behind the scenes. When my supervisor stopped giving me assignments, I asked for feedback and additional training. She reassured me that everything was fine with my performance, that they were just low on projects. I was abruptly terminated days later for multiple supposed issues that had never been brought to my attention. Be careful! good pay, decent benefits, superficial perks like potlucks and parties untrustworthy management, inconsistent values, poor communication A lot Just started, onboarding was a nightmare. Wish I was trained for day one. The technical issues and the amount needed to be absorbed in a short amount of time. Makes the whole process more daunting and overwhelming. Some people control it all There was one engineer in the group that clearly knew more than anyone else. Despite my efforts to befriend hin or to even get his help on certain issues, it was all for naught. Other people in other groups seemed to have the same non sharing attitude. Handi-Capable Once I became handi-capable, because life threw me a curve, I saw the writing on the wall regarding my position. And the department/company was becoming a sinking ship in my opinion, by not valuing their employees as they did in the early 2000 The employees Management 3 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Remote position allowed for flexibility. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Company frequently explores replacing American attorneys in editor positions with foreign-based attorneys or with paralegals. Frequent ""reorganizations"" result in people who have been with company the longest (and thus make more money than newer employees) are let go. Great employer Pros- Very professional firm with transparency and open lines of communication. The senior leadership team is knowledgeable and willing to help. The training strategy for staff is robust and consistent. Cons- this company buys smaller companies so talent acquisitions are not uncommon and you often see new faces and rapid changes in leadership. Solid well known company with some minor flaws Overall it’s a friendly place to work and people are typically responsive and willing to help though cross team communication takes a bit of getting used to. There is a lot of legacy tech debt but in the past few years I’ve seen a big improvement in the direction from leadership and actively updating old codebases, migrating apps to cloud as well as embracing more developer friendly tools. Unfortunately the pay I was offered starting out as a entry-level software engineer was fairly low and the raises since then have been not frequent/large enough that I have ended being paid well below industry standards. If you choose to work here have a plan to ask for the wage you want and ask about expectations for raises/bonuses. Hybrid/remote, Name recognition, Many intl locations, good work/life balance Can be low paying, some legacy tech debt Smart people with good work life balance Lexis is a very professional atmosphere where you are surrounded by smart people selling and servicing products to smart people. Pay and benefits seemed good compared to others. I wasn't there long enough to comment on promotions. Good entry level job Good place to work. I enjoyed my time there. It was too cold in the department I worked in so it was not a pleasant experience as far that. You need to be strong and lift heavy boxes (don't ignore that part of the posting). People are people, so remember to keep a positive attitude. If you have goals and want more in life, this stop will be a means to an end and will likely fund your business. The office does a lot for the team with fun days and gifts during the holidays. The company was really nice during the pandemic as they were essential workers. Plenty of incentives while working during those times. Worked from home for a while when switching departments. It was cool but still felt working in a prison at home. They should probably do more training before sending you home to work if you are new to a department. Overtime opportunities are there. My old dept worked weekends and holidays. If you have small kids please be prepared for that. Hard part of my job was paper cuts, tons of staples in shoes/clothes and not enough positivity in the workplace. The position served me well because I was off during the week and worked earlier hours on the weekend. Self scheduled breaks Limited training, demoralized workforce Productive and fun workplace. Learned new things and the co-workers are so cool and helpful. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting new projects and teamwork processes, and performance outcomes. 2 Worked hard with little thought of that when deciding site outcome Worked for many years and then was ‘divested’ to another company. No regard for experience or hard work done for decades. Transition was terrible with little regard for people. The company may have been incredible, but my department was constantly changing and no one was inspired. The company may have been incredible, but my department was constantly changing and no one was inspired. Management cared more about technicalities than the actual work. Relatively easy work Management was overly watchful and looked for criticisms actively, unless you were favored. High stress, low pay. If you enjoy a workplace with very high stress, lower than average pay, little chance for advancement, and being micro-managed to death, this is the place for you!! Decent but could be better LN provides average pay and somewhat substandard insurance benefits. Good group of people, you don't have someone micro-managing or constantly harassing you. Decent amount of time off, offset by system support and update schedules at times. Tend to limit innovation with the technologies they are willing to use. Excellent company to work for. This is likely the best place I have ever worked for. They are clear in their requirements and my manager is excellent. I find the work the appropriate amount of challenging and interesting. While pay and benefits could be a bit better they are far from bad. Additionally, during the COVID19 outbreak, the company immediately took action to protect its employees by allowing nearly everyone to go remote, upgrading our systems to allow it to happen, and instituted policies to protect when people decided to come back into the office. Interesting work, protects their employees, excellent work environment Outsourced They outsourced the entire customer service department overseas. When they were MDC American owned they were good, now owned by foreigners. They are now almost bare in a facility that used to employ lots of Americans. Towards the end they had two entire buddings made up of foreigners they brought in from India none outsource, layoffs stressful place to work The job was stressful all management cared about is the numbers not your well being or your mental state of being. I received more support from my co-workers than I did my supervisor or manager. All the managers and supervisors care about is making themselves look good. Although it was a M-F practically everyday i had to work mandatory OT, OT should be optional people have a life outside of work. For all of the hard work pay should have been way more. weekends off management Lots of chage New management is not about having a great work environment and have completely changed the culture. Lots of positions going to the Philippines. Base pay is low!! Big company with big company benefits and drawbacks Lexis is a big company and the management chain can be out of touch with both employees and customers. There's a lot of lip service paid to being data driven, but in my experience executive mandate can trump data way too often. The company benefits are good and most of the people who work here are great to work with. Well established and compensates really well. I worked at LEXIS/NEXIS from 1989 to 1995, I was promoted three times, aside from our great salary. we received $130/month for parking and $100 for affinity for our clothes. Great employee outings paid by LEXIS/NEXIS. Overall excellent company to work for. Pays well, great bonuses, great career opportunities Lexix/Nexis gave us training and excellent professional skills, therefore, I cannot say anything bad about LEXIS/NEXIS. Great place to work!! Exciting, interesting work and great people. This is a company that cares about employees and customers. It is well managed and absolutely focused on customer innovation. Good Benefits, poor management, lacks professional growth Depending on the department your time spent here may be different. The management in some departments do not care. They offer great benefits and bonuses. But, It’s hard to move up. You have to move to different departments to grow. They have certain people they want in certain places. They do have fun corporate events and give out a lot of free stuff and prizes. Good starter job. Great incentives, fun events, flexible hours, Buy Add. PTO, great benefits Poor management, little growth, low pay Great coworkers, flexibility Great coworkers and job flexibility. Decent pay and benefits though some jobs don’t pay well to start. After moving up the pay gets better. Good training. Job flexibility Low pay on some jobs Operation product coordinator If your light your right. Very bad culture in this company. They laughed and ignored all my suggestions. But my manager at the time would sell my ideas as her own. If you don't kiss up to upper management you will never get a head. I'm sorry this was my experience being that the functions allowed to the employee's were fun. That's the main reason I liked my job and my coworkers. Not stuck to your desk They had fun activities for the employee's Work culture Initially around 8 yrs back when i joined i would recommend people to join lexisnexis because of the work culture and management. They cared about the employees and appreciated all the efforys. After lexis nexis bought other companoes the culture changed and their was less appreciation for employees and more stress on work and. Employeez wete treatec with favouritism.if you were merged with the team from the newly bought companies the manager would favour his team members and offer promotions to them existing experienced team members who would be eligible for promotion where not offered promotion. Company offered paid time off for volunteer houurs,but management/manager never encouraged volunteering and always had excuse why somone couldnt volunteer. Good pay Manager got to decude work life balance Okay to work for Okay company, some unexpected perks. Work is very redundant/repetitive. Lots of manual data entry. Management ok but hard to relay issues with expectation of improvement. Pay is not that good, limited room for promotion within my dept. Work from home Opportunity for growth Not great culture, but ok there are very nice people to work with, helpful and knowledgeable. not much socialised event, this could be a covid thing. team is global and often feel distant and isolated from the team. there are very nice people to work with, helpful and knowledgeable. isolated, distant Get to work with very talented people Teams adapted well to working from home. Challenging projects. Much training is available. Get to learn new technologies and apply them to the legal profession. challenging projects and products Much churn on teams Analog company in a digital world Great name to have on your resume, but very relationship driven... meaning lots of folks get promoted because they are well liked, not necessarily because they are qualified. Pay correlates to title, not responsibility or expertise, so be prepared for low pay. Bonus is a joke. Work/life balance is minimal for many, but depends on management. Very antiquated systems and processes. This is the ultimate bridge job...get in, & get out. Lots of non-money perks--decent EAP, childcare benefits, discounts, etc Lots of politics, antiquated systems, little room to advance Stable Career but advancement is up to you Flexible and stable career with supportive teammates and manager. Work is clear-cut and dry most of the time. Company is big so there is structure but at the same time hard to get noticed. Benefits are ok, not too bad. Pay could be a lot better. Pto, flexible hours, can work remote low pay, hard to advance Productive and fun workplace. Learned new things and the co-workers are so cool and helpful. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting new projects and teamwork processes, and performance outcomes. 2 Excellent Intro to Corporate Life For the longest time this was a terrific company; they would hire locals with no publishing background and often no college degree, and over time teach them everything they needed to know and grow. They were excellent in this way, truly excellent, in that they'd take a local, a country person, someone with no formal training or higher education, and gradually turn them into a white-collar professional in the publishing field. It was this way for decades, and it was good. , This stopped COLD in the mid-to-late 90s at force of the dozens of re-orgs and LN hiring outside management consultants. At that point, they offshored most of the jobs to Phillipines or India, let all the legacy employees go, and only hired a handful for local operations, all of them college grads and no locals except for menial labor in facilities and shipping. This destroyed the culture and the quality of the experience there. And in many ways, destroyed the quality of the product, because it was not being made by Americans and native speakers of english, but by offshorers, and the work was not done with the disciplined rigor of those who had <grown into the job> but by zero-commitment and highly mobile yuoung college grads. It was the end of the company's loyalty to employees, and the end of any employee loyalty to the company. This was death by management consulting. The company deserves what it has gotten--a reputation as second-rate product produced by offshore sweatshops. , see above see above 1 Great workplace atmosphere Great benefits and work/life balance. Very good training that was ongoing rather than just initial. Good support from management and coworkers. Ability to move throughout the company in different positions. 1 1 Great Benefits and work culture This is a nice place to work, grow and advance if you have the right manager and support. There are a lot of work clubs and organizations to join and participate in. Great way to grow and possibly advance Some management has favorites Flexible company with terrible pay They are pretty flexible with allowing you time off for family emergencies etc. But the pay is absolutely awful. It barely feels like a living wage with as much work they expect out of you. Flexibility, nice people Pay. 30 minute lunch Good place to work Not much else to say. It was interesting work. Kept busy all day long. Met a lot of cool new people and it had a friendly and inviting atmosphere. I'd work there again if given the chance. not great Company has a good reputation in the industry as well as good benefits/PTO. Everything else is pretty rough though. Completely misaligned sales territories and horribly political/clique-y work environment. Unless you’re a personal friend of management, you’ll likely placed in a borderline unworkable territory regardless of your skill level. Management is dishonest in performance reviews and what they tell employees in general. It's okay for a short-term job, but it’s a boiler room and an overall unstable environment. Neither Good nor Bad Pay is okay; it's just a job and managers make it hard to become a career. I worked at the Duluth, Ga location and favoritism played a HUGE role in how your time would go there. The managers and supervisors were also very biased. Flexible work environment with excellent benefits I worked as a home based legal editor for Lexis Nexis in the 2000. That is how progressive Lexis Nexis was. They were way ahead of their time. It was a great work environment, lots of good training, and great benefits. The good things are good, but the bad things are bad. Company is dedicated to producing a good product. However, they are letting go of their older employees with lots of talent and good work ethic. Very good pay, benefits and work life balance. Training and opportunities for advancement is poor in most areas. Management changes too often. Good pay and benefits. Good work to life balance. Too many management changes. Too many layoffs. Poor job security for older people. Constant pressure for the next sale. Constant pressure for the next sale. Wanted us to promise the world. But never gave back end development support to help us give the client what they wanted. Work-Life balance Compensation and pressure to sell more and not being honest about what the data is being used for. Used to be a good place to work. Like most companies the job gets worse from year to year. Changes are implemented and almost always make things worse, harder and more work intensive. Decent benefits. Horrible data and haphazard implementation of desperate processes. Decent benefits Seeing many people leave is disheartening. The job is okay. Micromanaging leaves people frustrated. Constant management changes. Management is not supportive which is expected with a revolving door. Pto, diversity, product leadership Good People, Little Challenge, Less Optimism A standard corporate environment filled with drab cubicles and artificial lighting, for much of the year, you walk inside in the early morning darkness, work inside under fluorescent lighting, and leave again once it’s dark outside. The daily routine can be mind-numbing and downright depressing. I don’t think it is much of a surprise that co-workers who seem happiest are those who choose to work 2nd or 3rd shift; they have at least a bit more flexibility than those first shift employees whose jobs consist mostly of existing and taking up space in a cubicle and fighting to uphold the company’s image on the phone the rest of the time. Benefits, Pay, Co-Workers Morale, Little Chance to Truly Advance, Marketing Disguised as Services Great, flexible job for students This was an extremely fun position to work as a student. I really honed my research skills, which helped me with my post-graduation job search. The extra snacks and ""swag"" was a big plus as well. Excellent place to work The people you work with are amazing. You will have the opportunity to make a lot of money. You get to work with fun clients. They have amazing benefits. Detached Very hands off management style. It's an all right place to work, but there was no career advancement. I learned more about Lexis than I knew before... Lexis points No career advancement Great company to work for I have nothing bad to say about working here. The company has done a great job of moving forward and staying innovative. Leadership is strong and make sure that people are groomed and stress continuous learning. Paid well, interesting products . Strong communications (townhalls are frequent) Not a lot of growth I worked as a contractor You will be completely neglected and miss treated with no PTO. No paid holiday. No raises. No benefits. You get paid overtime if you work extra. But some people worked for years without getting hired full time. Great law school job I’ve been a member for a about 3 months and I enjoy the team atmosphere. It’s a great job to have while your a law student. Having the tabling events for the law students allows me to interact in an informal way and that networking is great. Networking, easy None Legal Research Consultant With the exception of management, great company overall. Work/life balance is prioritized, but goals often shift and positions/departments are easily eradicated. Productive and fun workplace. Learned new things and the co-workers are so cool and helpful. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting new projects and teamwork processes, and performance outcomes. 2 Great environment Great work environment. However the pay is not worth it to stay long term. Opportunities to hire from within get competitive because it’s such a large company. Low employee morale after recent layoffs (company says it had no connection to COVID-19 pandemic but the timing says otherwise) Fun work environment Low raises, micro managed. 1 Work hard play hard Awesome company to work for. It is a company that mzke you feel you belong to the company. The offer good benefits and an option to work from home after some time. 1 Poor workers and mean culture This company provides horrible working environment for women. Be careful if you are considering a job here. Very good salary with low to moderate binuses, and expensive health premiums that you will have to pay. Challenging smart work Toxic culture. Great people/ hard workers I worked at both the Alpharetta office and Duluth office i started as a temp and applied for an FTE position. I regret doing that because i ended up getting laid off after almost a year in my new position along with others who where there for years. Other than that i enjoyed the people i worked with and management was great and they actually cared. They do a lot of fun things in the office.. well at the Duluth office That i enjoyed and got you away from looking at a computer all day. Opportunity for growth as long as you do your work right and show up. When COVID came we immediately worked from home until further notice. Fun environment A lot of people laid off No Raises Be prepared for no raises and no promotions if you work remote. Lots of work being shipped offshore. No job security. They are reactive to what Westlaw is doing, not proactive. Work from home No raises, no promotions Hit or Miss Satisfaction with the company has to do with your leader. Finance leaders in LN Risk are horrible. It starts with the CFO who is not a people person and the bad behavior she permits from her VPs. No one really feels safe in their roles and you get ahead based on favoritism. Feed you a lot Inconsistent leadership Lay offs galore ● Work-life balance Always more work waiting, stressful ● Pay & benefits Good benefits but pay has not increased overtime ● Job security and advancement Ok job but lay offs any time they want to thin out. ● Management Hit or miss. Most of the good managers either left or laid off. ● Culture Might be better in other areas but Duluth is stuck in old ways, and unfriendly to new faces. ● Overall Third lay-off I saw in a few years included me. Always trying to send work out of the country. Unstable situation, at least in claims. Cliquish and unwelcoming unless you already know people...... Management is awful and training is poor When I was trained, I was not trained by people who best knew the procedures, or I was trained by people who management themselves labeled as ""bad"". When issues inevitably rose, I was given the blame and chastised for performing not as they wanted, when in reality, I had been performing exactly as trained. I never saw my manager unless something was wrong. I even asked her to interact with me more for the sole reason of understanding each other's communication style. Never happened. Condescending when interactions did occur, and just generally not fun to work for. The good was that the company allows you to choose your work hours, and the pandemic forced the company to set me up so I could work from home. My fellow contractors were the saving grace in it all. Decent work hours Inexperienced and ineffective management, blaming culture. Lexis nexis This is a tool we use to verify customer information, it’s pretty easy to use and help me do my job a lot easier. Credit bureaus help verify a customer new application Great Training Lexis Nexis offers Great training hgv as wonderful employees and they help with ways to advance. The benefits are wonderful and great priced. The 401k is 100% matched after 5 years of employment. Incentives Reconstruction/Layoffs There is no sense of job security. Lay offs are without any notice. Lexis Nexis doesn't value their employees. Random layoffs without any notice or reason. The people that do the most work and have a good work ethic are not valued. You are just a pawn Run run run away as fast as you can. Its not worth the stress. Eff that place and all who work there. It is a meat grinder and not worth the stress of meeting unrealistic goals Great Company Great work balance Fair Salaries Great benefits Diverse culture LexisNexis care about their employees and their families I would highly recommend to work here. Not the Place for me! When I first started, the compensation was very good. But it never really picked up from there. I had horrible issues with team leaders, and other leaders in the company. they were rude, didn't seem to care what you thought, and several years back, the drinking culture was crazy. they have since fixed that but my oh my, I cannot believe there weren't any lawsuits. VERY frequent unfair org changes, ""clicks"", favoritism, etc. I worked in a lead line for sales and while my Manager was awesome, I think he felt there was little he could do to help me some others who felt the same as me. things have changed some, but from one issue to another. Salary Many Great employer! I worked in one of LexisNexis's legal publishing operations as a software QA technician working on their electronic products. Management was great, mostly hands off with trust in their teammates. They were generous with granting time off and with comp time. Job is ok, not for a career I will give Lexi's Nexis a 3.5 for working environment. The Alpharetta building is really nice and has better opportunities there. This is not a career. Get certified in something and look towards on getting a career Some of your team mates Not a career Only shadowed/went for mentoring, but.. When I was there I got to see what my possible job-life would be, and at Lexis it gave me hope. Seeing the culture showed me how professionalism can be done in the tech-field. Hearing the employees talk about their life there and their roles showed how much they loved working there, and loved to have us shadow/be mentored on it. Really cool company, and has lots of opportunities for anyone in the IT or tech-field! False advertising I was hired as an analyst but ending up being a glorified customer service agent. You do way more inbound than outbound calling and majority of the time it isn’t fraud. Other managers from other departments are over everything even if they’ve never met you. Very frustrating and stressful. The hours promised are not the hours given, and training time was cut in half. It was a great company Working remotely is not easy. Teammates were not helpful and management had a very closed door policy. Workload was increased the more productive you were. There was no work life balance. Great place to develop and raise a family I had a great time at LexisNexis. It has a great balance and a wonderful culture. The teams really work together. Downsides--not as focused on individual development and pay does not increase steadily. Productive and fun workplace. Learned new things and the co-workers are so cool and helpful. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting new projects and teamwork processes, and performance outcomes. 2 Great compensation and benefits with a lot of incentives, bonuses and perks. Employee's matter and it shows, you can feel it. The company also has Volunteer programs that give back to the community. I want to work there again someday. Excellent Place to Work LexisNexis was a great place to work. I spent 15 years there until the business model changed and most people in my area were laid off. I did enjoy my time there. Very productive and pleasant work place LexisNexis is a place with great people and culture. The team was great and this company has given me a chance to enhance my knowledge and grow my career in the field. Highly Professional Operation LexisNexis Risk Solutions researches people and provides profiles to financial institutions so they can evaluate the reputational and regulational risk they face based on dealing with that specific customer. Their efforts help fight terrorist financing and money laundering. One of the most interesting contracts a person could have--learned a lot there, and helped them do important work. Totally enjoyed my time at LexisNexis Risk Solutions.. Interesting; important None A very good organization The parent company is outstanding. However, the culture persisting from choicepoint days are generally counterproductive. So, you can have a great manager or not. Great place. You could end up in a bad spot. Lots to learn Big data and analytics, HPCC systems, Lots to learn, ECL, Data science good place to dive deep into big data, company culture is good and encouraging management great company pluses: interesting application involving many technical skills, great colleagues, challenging work with good variety, full stack minuses: a bit too much bureaucracy and could benefit from updating to more current technical products fun place to work i had a great time working for them and their company I highly recommended it to my coworker and the also very helpful and kind and they make sure you take a lunch and break. Know your business; don't exaggerate your capabilities. Super workplace. In my case I was able to work from home for all but the first couple of weeks. Excellent, helpful co-workers... extremely bright and organized manager. The parties that they give to employees Not all management should be in management. Not everybody is a manger. Just because you have been there and have the seniority is not a good reason to be a manager. Productive and fun It is great experience to work in LexisNexis. Team are friendly and always ready to help each other. They are using and adopting latest technology. Company also provide training and learning sessions. great company to work for. Telephonic Solutions Consultant • Researching diverse areas of the law and working through complex research questions • Assisting and teaching attorneys, paralegals, and office staff in using LexisNexis products and assisting with legal research • Teaching Continuing Legal Education courses on online legal research and substance abuse to attorneys • Communicating daily with the law firms through email and phone to assure their research needs are being satisfied and providing assistance if necessary Fine company, no future for technical work in the Dayton area Lexis is a fine company. Flexible working hours, pay is fine. However, there is not much of a future for anyone with a technical position in the Dayton Area. All those jobs have been moved to the Raleigh NC campus. Lots of opportunities for development I am consistently on tasks that help me develop my skills and learn the business. The compensation is lacking and benefits changed recently. Overall I enjoy working here and with awesome supportive co-workers. Good Job Security Good job security if you work hard. Safe environment. Flexible working arrangements. I have made a lot of friends in my time there. Good for working parents. They could use improvement on technical employee training. Great products and people LexisNexis has great products and people. Lexis has done a great job listening to customers and implementing their feedback into products and through acquisition. Company is relocating all positions to Raleigh NC Great company, with great benefits, Team environment, well respected engineers in the field of technology & infrastructure, but I cannot relocate to Raleigh NC Culture used to be a lot better Lots of changes recently. Culture used to be pretty good, but not anymore. Upper management is making it more difficult to make money. Smaller territories with goals constantly going up. Great co-workers and management, gaming area for those into that thing Great co-workers and management, gaming area for those into that thing. Lots of food appears from meetings with customers and students, that the employees can devour the leftovers afterwards!! ;-) Overall Positive in the Time I Spent There This company has a great overall pool of employees. They have a generous PTO package and decent health insurance options. There is good work life balance collaboration. The issue with this company is job security. They were continuously laying high numbers of people off and eliminating jobs and I did not experience a lot of help in advancing or career growth."

Amazon Dev Center U.S., Inc.|" Good pay, terrible management Management is terrible - no oversight at all. Pay is fantastic for very easy work. Never met my manager once. Couldn't resign properly because he also wouldn't answer my emails. 3 It's exactly what you expect from a retail job. Pay is all right, and management treats you well usually. Management is usually really nice. Store is pretty small as it is meant to be a hybrid ""walk-in"" type of store. There are about 2 or 3 cashiers working the registers mostly. There are several assignments, some are very isolating, others are just dull. The most intense job is working the registers. If you're here to get a check, go for it. Sometimes they might ask you to help out other departments, you'll actually have to earn your money in that case. The produce department is the worst. Management is great, team is very welcoming, the overall culture is positive. Short breaks, Terrible break room with the same music that makes you go insane. Work place typical day when you scan in(clock in) you go to your dept leaders where they will randomly place you where help is needed they will routinely go around giving production numbers on your overall work production ratings if you are not scanning merchandise then they will get on you. My dept was Stowing, robot selves were ALWAYS full NEVER no room to fit merchandise in. if they ask you if you want to learn other depts be sure a raise will come in with the training you are receiving other depts were getting paid more for the job I was learning in. VTO was always a plus but only when it was available. You are just a number there to them. Its a good job to start off your resume. Benefits starting on day 1 Busy and fast paced helping time fly. Roles and job descriptions vary day to day. Majority of training is virtual computer based vs hands on.. Artificial intelligence plays more of a role than human communication Medical Benefits Lack of PPE Amazon flex Underpaid and overworked , they don’t even offer better pay during bad weather, also you half to wait at stores for hours, no extra pay, it sucks to work there Eh its okay. It's a job. Pay is good. Management is awful. You'll always be an expendable number. Don't try to advance. Not enough pay to justify the extra responsibility and risk. Good Repetitive work. No Interview Required. Occasional Raises. Stay on your feet whole shift. 30 Minute lunch break on 10 hr shift. 40 hours 4 days a week Fun environment to work with and meet mentors Enjoy the opportunity given to me by the company, went from a L1 Role to L4 within half a year and enjoy the teams I’ve worked with. Diverse culture engaging site and provides wonderful support for fulltime and part time associates Lunch It’s place to work but no fun there is lots of stress on work but you can make enough money to make money for average living expenses for single people They provide lunch when company exceed their productivity Short breaks but have good health insurance for those who want to pay productive its cool and laid back. Easy work. managment sucks . long hours. Its cool. Easy pay. Nice pay. Nice benefits. 3 days off four days working. overtime hours 3 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Being part of a large company. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Too many supervisors who are not all on the same page, making it confusing. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Fast paced. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Very busy, moving fast. 4 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Flexible schedule. You get to choose when you work. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? The very early start shift. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Go in, have a meeting and find out where you’re working. Go to your assigned working space. Depends on where you are but most of the spots are very fast paced and physical I love working at Amazon and here is why… The people… The training and opportunity to advance into other roles. Safety! “Today is just a start, tomorrow is what you make it” That statement is so true. I feel they really care about you as a person whether it’s being safe or having issues at home, they provide mental health if needed from day 1 along with many other benefits. You also switch up and get to do different jobs. There is not a hard job at this location. Our location is a sort center. Every age is welcome. 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? Medical, dental, and vision Benefits What is the most stressful part about working at the company? I was a PA and well Managers expect to much from you and every other associate, while they are behind a laptop just staring at you working and pointing out every bad thing but not congratulating when we beat records… What is the work environment and culture like at the company? It was very diverse and was really respectful with everyone’s culture What is a typical day like for you at the company? Very Busy from the start until the end very demanding pushed hard to make numbers Very busy on your feet for ten hours. No sitting is allowed even when you are entering data, even managers are not allowed to sit. To problem solve, train new hire and learned five different roles. Some people love working at Amazon and many hate it. Benefits managers are not there to help you they only worry about rate. 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? I was luck to be apart of the G&A team. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? There are so many tools to use it’s overwhelming in a good way. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? I was remote Physically exhausting Physically demanding Favoritism Great health benefits They pay around 5,000 for your school within 90 employment with them Long hours with only 2 30 minute break No job security Easy to use app that let's you see your time and attendance, pay information and your benefits ect. Good company Fast paced environment and information can be unorganized. Good culture surrounding learning and work life balance. Management is excited to train new employees, and leadership principles are key. Very unfair when discpline is brought up or when speaken too Very disrespectful people in management that love to treat people like they some useless piece of bag never trust them about anything alway lying.. fr Repetitive Good if you want to repeat the same things over and over everyday. However it got really tiring and feels unfulfilling. Usually, everyday I need to do at least two freezer runs. The jackets are stinky sometimes. Productive, provide fun events, and level-up opportunties This fulfillment center is a fast pace environment and gives opportunities for level-up and career changes. The insurance and all benefits are pretty good when you take advantage of them. The HR on-site is very helpful when you have questions. Good pay, terrible management Management is terrible - no oversight at all. Pay is fantastic for very easy work. Never met my manager once. Couldn't resign properly because he also wouldn't answer my emails. 3 Amazon.com Inc in a nutshell has gotten to big Like many other companies can get consistent hours workload is dependent on what type of warehouse you work in. Management is always good they fit people based on the area the warehouses are built in. Hardest part is the lack of knowing how much work will need to be done for the day usually never more than 180K max. Typical day at work usually consist of 70-80K packages at a small delivery station. Insurance Benefits, Higher Pay all around 1 Toxic Rate means more than you, all management are pervs and I’ve been to 3 facilities, overworked you if you’re good 30 miles a day but you make the same at your buddy standing in one place all day packing a box. There’s a few people that care that’s far in between but they have no power to help. 1 1 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? Gained new friends. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Working as hard and fast as you can, but told you're not moving fast enough. Managers standing around watching you work like wardens. 10-12. Hour shifts with 30 minute break. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Favoritism and cliques. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Every day is rushed. Productive fun work place. Amazon was a great place to work. It was one of my favorite jobs. They give you room to advance in the company and have great benefits! The only bad thing is the long hours. They have four days 10hrs shifts or three days 12hrs shifts. It can be a great company to work for as long as you do not have a family with small children, I enjoyed working at the Amazon fullfillment center in Seattle. Where I had my troubles in the beginning were not being allowed to sleep at home because of a bad relationship. But then when I got back on at the Amazon Fresh store the 10 hour days really started to get to me. All in all, it is a good company to work for if you're young too. Productive and Fun Place To Work I enjoy working here because time flies so quick that your almost going to lunch & than next thing you know your punching out! The labor is good for growth. Amazon is Amazon Good benefits. Bad is management. We definitely need more pay to work there. Fast Pace place. Not built for the weak. Every building is different. Good luck! Free holiday meals Short breaks Ok Under staffed, high expectations and fast paced. Time does go by fast, not always time for a break. If you work the overnight, you make more money. Decent pay and benefits for entry-level warehouse work Amazon is pretty efficient at hiring and training entry-level warehouse associates and offers decent pay and benefits on day one, especially if you start just before peak or prime days. The facility was clean and most people were friendly. It was pretty amazing to see how much product is warehoused, picked and shipped so quickly. Like really, it’s pretty cool. The problems are the same as any job, anywhere - people who don’t do their work and complain and bring their drama with them. Also, management who plays favorites. Good entry-level on-the-job training, clean facility, decent pay and benefits. Same as everywhere. Feels like I'm MTV punked. Very terrible management , they don't care if you get hurt working there. They don't want anything less then 110% unless you were the managers favorite Time off Everything else good place to work but... i worked for a year, its stressful ,employees make things worse. the culture is good. a lot of physical work, it also a place to make some friends. some people are very rude but others are nice and friendly. Disorganized its sucks. don't work there. the only good thing is that you get paid weekly. Management does not care about you. They want you to pick up the pace, but don't bother to actually help. I was a brand ambassador and got to work with other college students. I enjoyed my work. It was easy and meaningful and I was learning a lot for a college job. I planned events and posted on social media for them. I was exposed to new elements I had not worked with before. Great workplace Super fun I would love to go back but am on the bigger and more important things to do with my life and I love how easi training is my life and my life is not even doing a lot more than my overall good things to say good management, help is always available when needed, easy to advance if you put in the work, super easy to request days off if needed its all through the system Toxic culture The best way to describe Amazon culture is a meatgrinder that burns through management and associates alike. While pretending like nothing is the matter. Fast paced environment, various roles available Job security is there if you are willing to work hard and keep customer focus. Good time off options of paid or non paid time that was flexible. HR was always available for questions. Be prepared to do a lot of physical labor Working in the warehouse has a set routine. If you are excelling in particular section, you may be set into that position semi-permanently. If you are a good worker, leadership will call upon you to sometimes assist them in some of their duties. If you happen to be a poor worker, you may sometimes be put into a easier position. Which is unfair. Free lunches Physically demanding Honestly not as bad as people make it I hated working here at first, but after a while u get use to it and get close with your coworkers and honestly it becomes sort of a bearable work place No No no no if you want to stand all day and have back and hip problems by all means. This place is for single people or people with good child care. It’s tiresome Good pay, terrible management Management is terrible - no oversight at all. Pay is fantastic for very easy work. Never met my manager once. Couldn't resign properly because he also wouldn't answer my emails. 3 Meh I worked there as a seasonal employee. It wasn’t terrible but it’s the evil empire of Amazon. A lot of chaos but everyone one I worked with were decent hard working people. 1 Good Flexibility I enjoyed the flexibility of choosing my own schedule to a degree. Culture will depend on the on-site management but overall was pretty good. Great part time job or side gig. Not consistent rules from property to property. I felt isolated and singled out by management. Not a happy place to work. Pay is decent, benefits are really good. Hours can be difficult depending on which property you work at fullfillment or distribution. It has has beed the best job in my career Unfortunately I had to quit because I was planning leaving the US. The salary is excellent, the 4 day week shifts is excellent, to have 3 days off, I really miss that. Job safety is the highest, they really go by 'Safety First' The leadership is very good in terms of training the workers and very supportive . The management is very supportive. The leader is always checking on the employees to make sure that everyone understands their job role. I am really impressed with their smartness. 4 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Co-workers and pay rate. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Only having 2 - 30 minutes break for a 10.5 hour shift. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Everyone works together to get orders out to customers. What is a typical day like for you at the company? I work different areas everyday, there is typical day. The risks outweigh the benefits Safety regulations are often disregarded, in favor of maximizing output at as low of a cost as possible. Employees are rewarded for working fast, punished for not being able to keep up with increasing volume, and the turnover rate is huge due to the pay being so low for such a physically demanding job. Terrible Culture is terrible if you don't check woke culture boxes. Hours are long and management is inexperienced. You are just a number, and the only way to move up despite being labor tracked is to be friends with the right people. Decent pay Short breaks, favoritism, woke culture Good for extra cash Not for someone who need job stability or security. Okay if you need extra cash. The managers or team lead were not helpful. This warehouse felt like high school, very immature environment Coworkers Management, unorganized, no support Very boring work and not very fulfilling There was not a lot of work to be done at the facility I worked at so there was a lot of standing around and waiting for something to happen. It was nice at first but after weeks of just standing around it gets incredibly boring. Fun place to work. I have good experience working at Amazon. They have good benefits and the workplace culture is good. The management was always available to help employees with their needs. They were flexible with my schedule when I was finishing my studies at the Cisco Academy for my CCNA. I'm happy to be one of the IT Engineers of the MDW7 OpsTechIT. 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Great people great job great pay and benefits What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Time restraints What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Fast paced but fun What is a typical day like for you at the company? Variety of duties Love amazon Amazon is a place where you can be yourself . No one judges you. You are able to wear pretty much anything you want plus , they are very cultured. They accept everyone . I love the A to Z app, its amazing . Plus they have awesome benefits They only care about themselves Amazon is such a catfish company. They don’t train you they just throw you out there I worked at an Amazon go with the just walk out feature . Let me tell you , the store is so bad they canceled the other stores that were supposed to open shortly after . They extend it an extra year for them to open because the store was doing so poorly . The store has had empty shelves since grand opening 🤣 Tienen buen ambiente laboral Tienen un ambiente laboral muy ameno y son muy justos con la remuneración. Working in their warehouse is not good for your health. The actual work of this job is not difficult. The work environment is not optimal. The breaks are not long enough. If a work station is far from the bathroom there is a problem if you need a break. If you are injured at this job they will try everything to ensure they won't have to care for you. It as all about production and zero care for the workers as humans. Relax fun friendly Great environment friendly makes u feel wanted great understanding great work schedule paid weekly great benefits very understanding if u have children and need a schedule to work around Good job with great benefits but no work/life balance IMO Honestly the job is really easy and has a lot of great benefits and good pay, you can also advance with the company if that's what you are looking for. The only thing i didn't like after working 2 years is the Mandatory extra time calls, they were very frequent on my site so working 59 hrs a week for an entire peak season isn't healthy IMO but they also payed really well the overtime so if you are fine with having no life outside of work for a few weeks/months then the job is great. Good environment, Great pay and benefits, Growth inside the company, Good job overall. no work/life balance, frequent mandatory overtime good place to work I liked working there , but I needed more hours. I was a flex worker. management was really cool and understanding. they were easy going. there weren't any bathroom restrictions. 2 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Benefits and that’s about it What is the most stressful part about working at the company? You’re constantly under the watch of your management team What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Very sub par What is a typical day like for you at the company? Boring and you don’t feel human Good pay, terrible management Management is terrible - no oversight at all. Pay is fantastic for very easy work. Never met my manager once. Couldn't resign properly because he also wouldn't answer my emails. 3 Not a bad gig If you're a college student or something looking to pick up some extra hours a week, consider amazon. It's a solid gig. You choose your schedule at the beginning which means you are in full control. also, you can modify your schedule once you start, also there is a pretty lenient point system for callouts and tardies and the points are very easily replaceable. Also after working about 30 hours you'll begin to see some personal time to use or acrue which is basically paid time off as a seasonal/part-time employee. Actually considering going back for another holiday season 1 Easy mindless work The work is relatively easy, mindless, and fast-paced, but it gets boring and monotonous quickly. If you don't mind doing the same thing all day and every day, this is job is for you. They will hire just about anybody without a criminal record or failed drug test. The place is managed partly by their algorithms/software, so management/ HR just enforces company policy. It's a good place to learn to work in a warehouse environment. Productive and fun workplace Amazon was great place to work for. There are so many things that you can do through Amazon as it is such a huge company across the world. As a regular warehouse associate, you can travel with expenses paid through the company to help train the employees at a new location. You were given an number of vacation time, paid time off, and unpaid time off that you could either use or accrue throughout the year. The only hours you had to use by the end of the year were your paid time off hours. The other two rolled over to the following year. The only bad thing I really have to say about the company is the management. When I first started, I had a total of four managers that came and left the department in a season. Other than that, managers had their favorites and excused them for their actions. Free lunches over peak, drawings, giveaways, personal leave, time off(unpaid time off, paid time off, and vacation) healthcare and transportation to certain areas Poor management or just bad timing Amazon it Hard to get Computer In the Amazon company most by certain service groups always sought to tarnish the image at Amazon, and continue to lie about the good Amazonan workers. they hardly accept to solve the needs of others to build their future. I never received free lunch in Amazon 15mn free its a good place to start if its your first job or you are really in need of employment its a good place to start for your first job but I was working there for 2 years no raise and the management there sucked there always micromanaging you Fun Amazon has a lot of teams and good opportunities to grow Sometimes the oncall can get bad you can let your manager know. Sometimes performance evaluation is unclear Exhausting, you have to do others work. No bueno Just way too many stops per day, and if by a miracle you finish before the sun sets, you have to go help everyone who couldn't finish. Which is a lot because 70% of the staff are brand new since nobody wants to stay being overworked Nice work environment Nice managers nice coworker they have 4 day shift sun to wed and from wed until Saturday you goin to pick up the packages from 3 site supposed to not decrease the rate for the shift less that 60% Free coffee Great resources Career growth Great place to grow your career and learn new skills . Easy to move to other orgs if you meet the bars. Some teams are easier to join and get promoted to higher levels They have terrible rules. They treat you like children. And the worl is really hard - no. Joke. Find another job. All task at amazon are extremely psychically tolling. They treat you like children. They will write you up and take your job over stepping on a cart. Or an ear bud. The money is okay. But not for the amount of work nor how much you're making the company in a single night. The worst job I'm forced to have in my life. Productive Easy work great atmosphere to work in rotating positions within company once you come back from your break get a lot of breaks during your work hours Pay Dont leave for break Hard work It was hard work once I started but after while I got used to the work things was explained to me as I took on different positions and before leaving I had applied for learning ambassador and left at that position. terrible just terrible... run. they would over work you even you exceed the daily goal rate you wll still get called out Flexible schedule Online shopping is stressful when we are micro managed. Constant walking on hard surfaces. Breaks aren’t long enough to rest your legs and feet. Pay is okay but we should be making at least $20 an hour. 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? It’s an easy job to get that’s about it . What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Everything, long hours, no staff support, under trained management, you are treated like another warm body. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Terrible , they don’t care about their employees at all. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Stressful, you have stressed out people above you taking everything out on you . It’s stressful on all levels . Great At-Home Job Great job both part & full-time from home. Works with schedules. Management was alright, I didn't feel valued or appreciated. Definitely recommend this position if you want something chill. workheavy wasnt bad, you have to stay on top of your duties Otherwise they will replace you very quickly. Hours are pretty long, but pay and benefits make up for it. 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? I learned about sort center operations and robotics. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Lack of support. Poor leadership in upper management with little to no warehouse experience. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Poor. HR literally watched cameras just to write associates up. No support for managers. Worked 65+ hours a week. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Minimum 12 hours. Very high stress level. Don't apply Amazon and management don't care about you. They only care about rates numbers and there bonuses. After 4 years they started treating me like i was nothing saying I don't work hard am a bad employee all that then set me up to be fired. I would avoid Amazon at all costs. Plus there pay and benefits are weak compared to others company's. None They will work you to death then toss you out the door when they are done. Cool Definitely was a cool and fast-paced environment to work in. Great pay and even gave pto. It was also great because you got benefits such as dental and other great things. Good pay, terrible management Management is terrible - no oversight at all. Pay is fantastic for very easy work. Never met my manager once. Couldn't resign properly because he also wouldn't answer my emails. 3 Very flexible work environment Amazon flex allows individuals to create their own schedules and complete work at their own discretion. All job responsibilities and instructions are located in the app. Hard, but doable Working in a warehouse already has it's problems. With Amazon, they try to be fair, but 10 hours, 4 days a week on your feet (with reaching, lifting, kneeling, basically full range movement) is hard on the body. Also, their break policies are a bit draconian. 1 Easy job. Easy job. Just be prepared to deal with irrate customers all day. Pay is not all that great for the things you deal with in a daily basis. It’s a paycheck. Dont apply Job sucks, management sucks, easy job, but if you are good at the easy job your at you keep doing it, unless youre a favorite and or a yes man, no growth guaranteed, favorites get everything. They will screw themselves to hold a spot they need filled till the favorite comes in Money Everything 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Pay and benefits What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Long hours What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Culture diversity really good environment everyone is team players Good Company Amazon has a lot of teams and good opportunities to grow Sometimes the oncall can get bad you can let your manager know. Sometimes performance evaluation is unclear Technical challenges oncall Flex but No advancement I've been at the company for 2 years and 8 months and there was no possible way of improvement and no possible way of getting a higher pay. HR and Managers seems to either do know answers to questions or just don't care because one tells you to talk to the other and it pretty much does back and forth. Online discount, Two 15's and 30 break No Advancement, No answers to simple questions, Barely open to suggestions. Usually easy It’s an okay place to work. I wouldn’t go above and beyond though, your work isn’t usually noticed. Managers are usually young and easy going. The PA’s think their managers. Don’t get me wrong, it’s not that bad, but I wouldn’t stay very long. Flexible shifts Short breaks Overworked and painfully boring They pay new hires more than regular workers. There’s a reason they’re running out of people to hire. They expect u to be back at exactly 15 minutes regardless of how far u have to walk to the break room. They don’t allow headphones and instead play awful music on speakers making the day worse Productive and fun workplace Good pay Weekly pay Bonuses And great people to work with Easy lifting Team work Flexible work schedule Work/ Life balance Raises Praised for good work Easy work Always room to grow. People are taking amazon for granted. Some want a raise just for being x-trained into a new path, but won’t apply to T3 roles or new building launches (the real way to get promoted) I started in January as a T1. Went to a new building launch as a T3 in June. Got that sweet $10k launch bonus and pay went up $3.10/hr. None of that would’ve happened if I declined cross training opportunities and/or took loads of VTO! It happens from being willing to cross train into other paths, which can lead to indirect role opportunities and helping with other projects. That is what gets your name and face out there. Start networking with your peers and leadership. Eventually they will become familiar with you enough to where you can easily get into an indirect role. That opens up huge opportunities to get to the T3 roles. Once you become a T3 you just need 2 years of Amazon work history to apply for most of the T4 roles inside Amazon. During that two years you should be utilizing the $5,250 Amazon gives you each year to further your education or get certifications in a field that interests you. Amazon isn’t a s*** company. You’re in their s***ty position. Take advantage of what is being offered and don’t feel left out to hang. Fun place to work at You can always look for work to do and learning new positions/skills. In a matter of being there 2 1/2 weeks I was automatically made into a Blue Badge (full time) and got to be certified as a Water Spider which made my job not only challenging but I loved going to work there everyday :) Discounts, great team to work with, able to work up to 59.5 hrs every week, communication and team huddles every day N/a 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Cool environment and you get rewarded for great work What is the most stressful part about working at the company? It's a fast paced facility 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? The employees What is the most stressful part about working at the company? The hours What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Diverse mix of people. Loved it What is a typical day like for you at the company? Busy busting out work Very little job security and no real managers You didn't have direct managers nor did you have anyone to report to other than yourself and a machine. You simply showed up, tapped in, worked till break, work again then out door. Simple job, good benefits The job itself is easy, just can get tedious within the 10 hour work day. I feel they are fairly generous with time off and you don't need approval to use your PTO or UPT. The only downside is overtime during the holiday season and prime. Nice people They work with u On if you need days off or need help they help you It’s very easy work I mean and you gotta wear the steel toe shoes and they kill your feet but everything would be OK Terrible If you want to be gaslight and manipulated on a daily basis while watching incompetent management do nothing except sit on their phones and laptops, it’s the perfect place for you. “flexible” hours only if they deem you disposable and not necessary to general functions, or else they’ll do anything they can to keep you in the building, including letting 10+ people go home right in front of you while saying they need you there. Good pay Lots of hard work but good pay ,be ready to stand on your feet for long periods of time.They are picky about employees meeting their packing goal and check on you constantly . better work environment needed the building is hot. the roof leaks when it rains. overcrowded. more harassment awareness needed. underpaid. short lunch with long hours. no phones or ear buds allowed"
Microsoft|" Excellent Employer Microsoft was an excellent employer and a very good work environment. Great Co-workers and staff. Definitely one of the best jobs I've ever had. Would do it again in a heartbeat. Rewarding experience, smart people It was a good experience. The people are smart and relaxed. The work was advanced and I learned a lot. The downside was that I had to use Windows, while Linux is a better fit for my needs. Microsoft Sales Not always easy. Definitely received mixed messages from Msft Management. Yes, every year my sales quota was double digit growth. My sales quota when I started was $23M/year and 15 years later it was $68M/year. Good team mates Always hustling Great company to work Microsoft is a great company . Work like balance is a reality. Opportunity to learn new skills. Everybody is willing to help. Also a company with great benefits. Service Desk Sweat Shop Don’t not recommend the number of tickets assign to each engineer is insane. The only way to survive is to put some of the workload to others. Management only care about themselves and training does not exist. It’s one of those soul sucks jobs that leads to depression. Great place to work Customer obsessed product priorities Empathy is the foundation of people interactions Collaborative employees Great benefits esp the giving campaign match Opportunity amidst politics The company has always required employees to perform at highest levels, but the politics of a large company and the culture of competition stifles rapid delivery and collaboration between team. Some business units are better than others - like many small companies within a profitable larger company 60+ hr work weeks Especially when working with offshore projects you're expected to work normal shift and then communicate or manage teams in India on opposite schedule Free food and drink at all hands Yearly reviews are not fair as peers forced into bell curve performance ratings Best work/life balance of all FAANGM-tier tech companies MSFT is a great place to work if you want to get your foot in the door at a tier 1 tech company. It has its hand in every field in tech so you can always find a team that fits your needs in case you don't like the team you're currently on. The pay may not be as high as other companies, but it's well worth the better work/life balance. Productive and fun Excellent company with great benefits. Management was very helpful and kind. I absolutely loved my time with Microsoft and highly recommend it to anyone. Note: This is a fake review Excellent Career Start Working at Microsoft taught me how to be a successful professional. I was greatly encouraged to grow and succeed as a professional. Overall the management had a very hands-on approach that worked well with the style of work. Productive and fun work place. Productive and fun work place. Everyone is willing to lend a helping hand. Overall positive work culture with great work life balance! There are also plenty of employee resource groups that allow you to feel comfortable bringing your authentic self to work. Great vision insurance and employee resource groups! Best place. Great and welcoming people. About it i could say everybody who has a chance, just give it a shot. There is nothing compared to that kind of experience. No work life balance People are often mistreated, laid off with no prior warning, I work off hrs, I was once even threatened to do my job saying your performance depends on this and other people were laid off so think about it. I don't appreciate a work environment that doesn't feel psychologically safe and secure. They do pay well yes but that's about it. productive and rewarding I was a fellow for a bit at Microsoft and it was very very fulfilling work. They also let me do the project that I wanted which was a very very good front facing project involving city officials and more. Stay away Cloud Divisions The division of Microsoft responsible for cloud infrastructure is dysfunctional and poorly managed. While there are some extremely talented and collaborative people in the middle levels, management treats them as if they are disposable and creates an environment where trying to do the right thing is discouraged. Work life balance is non-existent, and far more time is spent blaming people for things beyond their control than actually working as a team to identify and then solve the problem. Smart and innovative people doing the work Management, unrealistic expectations, acceptance of bullying by senior managers Great team and amazing culture! Loved my time at Microsoft! They have amazing benefits, encourage learning, supportive teammates, and knowing I was directly helping others was a great feeling! Training over 900 people at one time for a live event was both professional and personal growth for me. Again loved my time there! great work life balance Pros great work life balance team is very nice and helpful unlimited PTO the best benefit ever Cons pay is low than the industry oncall is stressful and work for long hours Fun environment While the work environment is fun there is some micromanagement. You will be learning a lot and the benefits are good but there should be more transparency with upper management. Assistent manager I loved my job and people were always helpful. Benefits and pay were great as well. Loved the location and safety of the area. Wish there was better park. Laid back atmosphere Enjoyed the company and the people I worked with. Free drink machine with no limit, dress code was dress respectfully. Management listened to all concerns from employees. Excellent Employer Microsoft was an excellent employer and a very good work environment. Great Co-workers and staff. Definitely one of the best jobs I've ever had. Would do it again in a heartbeat. Xbox is fun, lighthearted and a dream culture/company for many But it is still work. Expect to spend time heads down during heavy focused periods. But overall, what you are working on and launching is really pretty cool, especially if you love Gaming. That is not required though - if you love Media & Entertainment, Xbox is still a great place to work. Perks+ ($1500 additional for fitness, other related expenses) Excellent Company! Best part of my day is getting to work with such an amazing talented team. Everyone I work with is intelligent and I constantly learning something new. Management is excellent and always makes me feel valued. Overall, Excellent Company! Great place to work! Management, Workplace Culture, and Work-Life Balance. None Good pay It was a great company to work for, I have learned a lot about software development and data strucures as well as hot to work in a software development team. Product Manager Standard Big Tech Company, Great Pay and Benefits, good work life balance depending on the team you work for. Great Workplace flexibility as well. Politics are just like every other company, but I think Work Life balance, Friendly people and overall culture Politics depending on the org, work progress is often slow and inefficient Flexible work time and environment, good options for career growth and movement. Great company. Occasional high pressure times like any tech company, but it's not constant. Good benefits, and flexible on your work environment and schedule. Top Good place to work. Had. A. Lot of fun working with knowledgeable people. And most best worked in those fields in the workld I recommend it for everyone to try Interesting work with good pay Depends on team, but lots of good work in lots of areas. Every piece of software you use on a regular basis is produced by another team in the company that you can easily contact on teams. Boring Place place is absolutely boring with older people. never had the opportunity to network with younger people and the work being done there was so slow and did not matter to me. Ability to grow The company gave me a chance to break into tech, and I started learning cloud computing and decided to got further by choosing devops as a career and I am doing great for myself. Horrible politics. Cliques. Some groups are obviously better than the others. Many groups are very much OLD Microsoft. Just awful. Pay, Benefits, work, life balance are all ok. Decent pay and benefits. Worked there for 29 years learned a lot, but the last 10 years was a revolving door of managers. Managers constantly changing my accounts year after year solving the same problems over and over. Finally got feed up a quit. Haven’t looked back. Goodtimes I love coming into work every day and punching away on my keyboard and making the company billions. It's truly a great experience except when I have to teach the managers how to do their jobs. dollars work Amazing place, best wlb I love this place and how they encourage you to grow, the wlb is amazing, I really like the projects and how we are customer based focus. You will feel very important and will learn from others too. Career growth Horrible Maagement Management did not care about their employees especially when it came to mental health. They also had their favorites as well as they allowed employees to threat harm on other employees. Great organization, can depend on manager Microsoft is a fantastic company to work for, but your experience can vary by who you work for directly. Culture is good, but still a few holdouts to the old ways. Great place to work Microsoft is awesome. You'll meet lots of likeminded people, and there is always something cool to work on depending on the team. They promote moving horizontally to other teams if there is something else you would like to work on. Benefits are also top notch. Productive and fun atmosphere Wonderful work culture, good managers. I recommend them to anyone. Very different from other big tech. Wonderful work culture, good managers. I recommend them t Productive and Fun place I really enjoy working at microsoft. it's the best place in the world to work at. the people are super smart and i'm totally not just saying this to meet the wordcount Contract work is not worth it here for the money but job was easy I worked as a contractor for MSFT and was grossly underpaid. Job was very easy and flexible. Job was kind of boring. No opportunity to get out of contract work. Mediocre pay, but overall good place to work Base salary is okay, but stocks are really minimal compared to other tech companies. Often you'll find your self out of things to work on and you need to really push hard with your manager to get visibility and subsequently promotion Excellent Employer Microsoft was an excellent employer and a very good work environment. Great Co-workers and staff. Definitely one of the best jobs I've ever had. Would do it again in a heartbeat. Good pay The work is very comfortable. I learned about team communication and social skills. The management cares for employees. Hardest part is learning. Enjoyable part is that I actually do not work here idiots. 1 1 Productive and Fun Place I work as a product manager in Microsoft, the design and architecture of the IT products could make you learn a lot. The working environment is great with plenty of nice foo d and snacks. Avoid azure!!! Pros: - great benefits and competitive comp - free lunch on campus - lots of facilities on campus too Cons: - poor WLB - boring work with lots of on-call - devs depend on other internal services which are always broken Contractor Learned how to test software as a contractor in an ever growing world of professional software development and professional software testers and engineers. Great place to work I have worked for Microsoft multiple occasions as an FTae and contractor. All of the experiences have been positive. The culture is something that I really appreciate. You will find that there is always people who want to support you or give you great advice. They are focused on their employees to have a good balance between work and life. Professionally speaking, you'll find yourself understood and teams always welcome new ideas. Lots of resources and things you can learn. They are a great company focused on diversity and innovation. I worked with HCA and I'm not really sure why indeed is showing Microsoft. I answered as if I were reviewing HCA. I worked with HCA and I'm not really sure why indeed is showing Microsoft. I answered as if I were reviewing HCA. Working with HCA introduced me to a large blend of people that I would have never met had I stayed in El Paso before I moved to Dallas. It's a great environment to work in. Advancement and you learn alot while in the hospitals. Grinding work and long hours especially with an on call rotation. Great work/life balance and great place to work Microsoft, in my opinion, is one of the more relaxing companies to work at. However, there doesn't seem to be much growth for contractors unfortunately depending on your position and team. All the food is subsidized and not free as well. However, the people are great and the working environment is usually great as well. Career Development MSFT provides me an opportunity to learn new and exciting technologies, however, there is not a firm / clear career path for advancement. Given that MSFT is more of a products company, it still needs to mature its technology services organization. Mature Company Mature Company with good benefits. Excellent healthcare, dental, and commuter benefits. Difficult to move up if in a lower level position.such as an admin or coordinator. Fast pace yet slow to change Microsoft is Big. Both in revenue and size. This creates interesting challenges. You could be working across time zones, you could be owning a piece of the business to manage. You own your work. However being able to influence change at the company is not that easy. Great benefits and work environment Outstanding work environment, people and benefits. The pay is good but the benefits are the real selling point. In my experience management has been doing a great job. Ehhh Culture is okay due to management, but overall feeling of belonging is low. The managers kind of view you as another cog. Would recommend this to others. Awful work/life balance. ""Customer is always right"" ideology that should have stayed in the past. This company is like a box of chocolates. You never really honestly know what you are going to get. The compensation and benefits are nice but other than that the working environment is just a front for truly stressful jobs. Of course, I think it all depends on luck. Because development teams have a clearer purpose and better benefits while there are teams where you are just a number. If you are not in the United States or another major city and if you are not a manager/dev/designer then look for something elsewhere. Benefits, compensation, ergonomical office supply Stressful environment, ancient ideals about support, awful work life balance Challenging and rewarding Opportunities abound at Microsoft if you make a product with high impact. There are so many benefits. All of the benefits pretty much. And no micro m. Great Place to Develop Your Tech Skills It's Microsoft, they have all the resources for growth you can need. Very in-depth processes that help with daily responsibilities. Some of the processes can be unnecessarily complicated at times, but overall culture and management is very on-point and helpful. Fake Culture With a Stressful Agenda Culture is unfortunately very focused on brown nosing and lead by leaders supporting this practice. Tons of “whoop whoop” and fake “everything is peaches” meetings. Not a place for a positive mindset, little support for growth internally, and you will likely find yourself having multiple managers each year as it’s a rotating door with almost half the staff being new. Very large requisition loads (handling 2-3 recruiters jobs). Can’t recommend avoiding more despite the brand name. Poorly managed contract work I was on a team of contractors and most of them didn't know what they were doing. I often had to redo my coworkers' work. The work was monotonous and easy. I often had days where I had nothing to do. Because I was working through an agency, I was only paid hourly and felt both underpaid and underappreciated. Passive aggressive culture with limited opportunities for growth Passive aggressive culture with limited opportunities for growth unless you suck up to LT. Leaders lack diversity in leveraging different way employees work. good pay at a steep price i averaged 2-3 managers during each fiscal year/performance review period for over a decade, never had a manager stay in role more than 1 year the sales and compensation numbers never matched and you have basically no recourse customers hate dealing with MSFT people culture is very cutthroat and your competing against everyone on your team and at your role level for your pay benefits culture, managers, peers, customers Azure cloud Yes!!! Amazing Cloud technology and service with SQL and their interfaces. I would prefer if they could integrate some of their platforms more into a whole lot more of recent android technology instead. Their interfaces and databases run so much better than android and I think I would stick to using Azure Cloud Storage technology Excellent Employer Microsoft was an excellent employer and a very good work environment. Great Co-workers and staff. Definitely one of the best jobs I've ever had. Would do it again in a heartbeat. Exciting workplace, good direction Company leadership has changed. Much better than in the early 2000s. When the going gets tough, the old boy's network and culture kicks back in. Otherwise very positive Interesting mission Slow leadership decisions at the top Contracting at Microsoft In a relatively short MS contract, I had a supportive team who kept work in perspective while accomplishing the tasks at hand. My immediate manager helped me greatly grow my editing skills as I worked with him. Great company, learned a lot, expected to move up or out. Worked for Microsoft for 13 years. I learned a ton, enjoyed most of my roles, and felt like I had an impact. But, its a move up or out environment. Once thaey think you've reached your peak and won't continue to climb the latter they will move you out and bring up someone younger and still growing. Also, make sure you have a good manager. workplace give us your opinion about a typical day at work what did you learn management workplace the hardest part of job the most enjoyable part of job do not Great culture. Broad product spectrum. Poor salary. Working with Microsoft for the last 4 years. My reviews- 1. Great culture. 2. Really broad product spectrum. 3. You can easily move to other teams. 4. International opportunity. 5. Poor refreshers even if you are exceptional employee. You have to move out after 4 years of time period. Microsoft = good company to work for I worked as a contractor at Microsoft and the team I was on was fantastic. I didn't feel like a contractor, just part of the team. I did have to work more than 40 hours to make an impact sometimes as there is a greater pressure on contractors because we have no stable role, so work/life balance was just okay (and no paid holidays), but our manager was really cool and made up for that. Hardest part of the job was that you need thick skin. They all say that, but you really do. Some managers curse and yell at you and you can't get HR involved because you're just a contractor. Also, a bit of nepotism going on. They pick favorites and it's clear who will get full-time and who won't. If you're wanting a laid back easy job, don't work here. You will fail. Good workplace Good place to work, chill, opportunities to learn. However, pay increases have been minimal and it's not as easy to move internally compared to some other big-n companies Flexibility Great flexibility for new mothers they have a great work culture. Management was very understanding and works with you. Short term contract. Would go back anytime Of all companies I've worked for, Microsoft is easily the best. Microsoft is the best company by far I have ever worked for and one of very few that avoids a culture of frequent complaint and trashing of the company. That I've given it very few five star ratings is based mainly on the fact that one my managers was toxic, abusive and unable to explain with any clarity what the project even was. A general sense of pride in the company vs. frequent belly-aching, a good deal of autonomy, flexible hours, large well-tended campus, interesting and challenging work Everybody gets an office (no cubes) but you may share it with 2-8 other people, occasional bad apples about whom there's little to be done, excessive use of language like ""Awesome!"" and ""You rock!"" They keep most of their staff on contract Poor management and nontechnical managers social climbing for higher paying management roles. Everyone wears a fake smile there and acts like the are in love with the internal culture. However outside of meetings/the office you can learn quite fast what employees really think of the company and management. They keep most of their staff on contract and constant promise of advancement and long term placement while not delivering the majority if the time. They keep most the staff as contract workers so that they can shine light on how well their benefits are for their full time employees. In short, they keep most the staff on contract to not have to provide them with the “great benefits” that they brag about and the contract employees always get the short end of the stick. Work and work I enjoyed my time at Microsoft the people customer services was required but fun got to learned a lot from different guest and their culture and I loved it need to have patience and understanding if you don’t have the skill for customer services you are in the wrong field. I loved it and it’s people would I do it again my answer would be YES !!! Productive and fun workplace I absolutely love my job at Microsoft, the people here are very productive individuals. I would highly recommend any new young determined individuals to check it out! Good overall Microsoft is good overall but has its issues as do all places. Parts of the company have leadership that has been around for a long time and is uninspired. Great company with tons of benefits its great the managers the buildings everything. its a growth focused enviroment with tons of flexabily to move around in the company.

I no longer work with them but it was a great time for me. I learned how much I didn't know. I was a vendor on contract with Microsoft. Other than the pay and benefits from the contracting company this was one of the best work experiences of my life. I learned more over the course of my time here than I had in the 15 years prior. Project management, true excel mastery. It was very much like going to college. The FTE's I worked under were very much mentors to me. I cannot express how much this job/environment changed my life. Pay attention, MSFT has masters all over the place, and if you're open to it, you will learn. Great work environment Vendor/Contractor Pay Great place! Working at Microsoft was great I never had to worry about job secutity as our marlet share is so large. That was never a worry for myself.

We manage a big workload which can get stressful but rewarding. Free lunches, etc. Short breaks, etc. Good start of tech career I joined as a contractor and worked 18 months in the Surface touch lab. Almost everyone was nice and easygoing. The tasks were not hard and easy to learn. I will come back if I had the chance.

Great manager with excellent life/work balance values I had one bad experience with a FTE who treated me like her secretary until I fought back. Meaningful Growth Minded Work Aside from the fact this is a very large company and span of control can be narrow, I find most work to be interesting. Culturally there is a push for work-life balance, respect and allyship for others. Career challenges are typical and expected — managing how others view you (for rewards cycle) with some roles providing greater opportunity for growth. Enjoyed working there. great culture. The company is top-notch. The benefits are really great. The culture is great. Your raises depend on your personal impact to the bottom line. Wonderful company to work for. If you get a chance, take it. overall that is very good Microsoft is overall is a balanced company. It provides a great work environment with a good culture, professional for all employees. I can't see anything negative there in all my period. Great Microsoft is a great company. Great benefits. Great people and culture. There's really nothing bad about it. Career progression is good too. Lots of roles available to move around. Experienced Microsoft employee Corporate roles are good and full of benefits, other roles not so much. Get lucky with leadership because it’s very hard to find a mentor so someone willing to help you grow. Flexibility Work life balance... the way they promote diversity and inclusion along with wanting individuals to be successful and have growth mindset.... benefits are always about compensating to accommodate the dynamic environment but professionally and personally. Incredible work-life balance I was on Microsoft for a Software Engineering Internship. Even as an intern my work felt meaningful and challenging. What I most enjoyed was being in control of my own time, specially considering that I was working remotley. Work life balance, great compensation, free swag, great bewnefits None so far Treat sales employees very well, best managers I ever had I had great managers at Microsoft. They really cared. I also liked that you could move up the ladder as an individual contributor and didn't have to become a manager. good for the resume nice brand name to have on your resume. grunt work supporting o365. very little training was provided. documentation was never updated. no collaboration. every man for themself type attitude. There was no work life balance in supply chain management. It was mandatory to have to work 75 hour work weeks or more. Not for me. See above summary. Very poor work life balance. There were mandatory 75 hour work weeks the entire time there. Unnecessarily oppressive, intimidating, and poor management overall. Employees are treated like they are company property."

I would love to work here full-time. A good side hustle Really enjoyed working for this company, nice little side hustle. You are considered a 1099 private contractor with a minimum number of hours to hit each week. Occasionally there wouldn't be any work, but for the most part you can fit abstraction hours in around a regular job. Very flexible job I work as a part time remote abstractor. The great thing about this job is the flexibility. They require a commitment of 10 hours a week but you pick when you work your hours. I can work during the day, the middle of the night, weekday, weekend. That part I love because it’s the perfect side job since it’s so non-invasive. Compensation is decent too. The only downside is that you’re not guaranteed your hours. They have a set amount of work that’s uploaded on the first of the month. Then, if the work is completed before the first of the following month (which doesn’t happen frequently but often enough to notice), you may possibly have a chance to do cross-training to earn your hours via education. But that’s not always guaranteed either. Decent compensation for a remote position. Very flexible. Not too difficult. Hours not always guaranteed. Cross-training can be annoying Flexible work As an Abstractor I work remotely in my PJs with coffee in hand. No drama. Love it! Good pay. If you don’t understand the task given you can always ask for help. Managers are all remote. Company provides laptop. Work life balance Sometimes run out of tasks 10 Probably wouldn’t return There was not much support offered for the detail oriented job that was expected. Not room to grow and learn, just constant pressure and fear of not being able to complete the expected tasks. Many threats of being cut if you didn’t meet their requirements but made to feel stupid if you asked questions. Fully remote Everything else 2 Productive and fun fast growing company with great people and a great cause - Superb and intelligent group of people dedicated to a great vision and mission. - Rapidly growing company with many different teams improving over time on team collaboration. - Great place to work with great benefits and plenty of food, drinks and snacks - Supportive management Great benefits, company paid for travel and meals, great cause, great team Lot of travel, work life balance 1 Fully remote and flexible Good company, fully remote and a lot of subject areas to learn and grow in.There is plenty of education and feedback given. The flexibility of hours is the best part of the job. remote repetitive Remote Abstractor Interesting work, but can feel very disconnected. You can’t ask questions answered directly when you run into problems with a case you are abstracting. You send it for review and hope for a helpful answer, which can take days. In the meantime, you have to continue abstracting similar cases with similar questions. Pay could be better. Challenging work from home Flatiron was a fantastic remote position. I especially enjoyed working from home with easy access to company staff when necessary. The tasks were varying in all aspects of oncology diagnoses. The data that I abstacted is very valuable for the future of cancer care. Great perks Flatiron had amazing perks and there was alot of room for growth unfortunately management was not trained and you had very little say so in anywthing. Even in your own projects. Working remotely has advantages Nice to be able to work from home as a part-time employee; but that means questions may take a couple days to be answered, if at all. Seems like a decent company and I appreciate the cause. Remote work Time lag for questions and pay is so-so. great place to work when work is available as a contractor work is available on a first come first serve basis so to speak this is a true part time job, however, training is excellent. Working remotely is a plus, and there is excellent communication within the company. Overall a great part time job ! too many to list task availibility Abstraction They are an excellent company to work for. They have great communication skills. Great salary. Flexible with your schedule. Room for growth if you want it. love working here I loved working for this company but unfortunately, it was a contract job. However, the company offers fulltime positions and the employees are happy. Flexible hours were a plus and excellent pay flexible hours. decent pay need to be certified Very positive culture, great educational opportunity. Very positive culture with great training available. There is always support available when needed. I am continuing to learn at Flatiron. I am pleased that I can use all of the experience that I have gained in Oncology in another very unique Oncology RN position. Hardest part of the job- maybe that there are not enough hours for abstractors which has led me to seek another position. Flexible schedule, great pay, positive culture. little work available Great workplace with lots of advantages Flatiron Health is a strong, rapidly growing company that requires quite a bit of effort from it's employees. The corporate culture is strong but if you cannot devote your life to the company, if you have a long commute into NYC it may not be the place for you. However it is a good place to work. Snack room, free lunch, enthusiastic employees Put the hours in or else. Half the company is SWE's and they are valued over all else. Flexible Little opportunity for advancement or salary increases. There are full-time positions available, but I have applied twice and been refused. My work is consistent, but it seems to be a popularity contest. Work from home Never get a raise Great The company has an amazing mission, great people, a lot perks. The overall culture is very welcoming and you will learn a lot. Many different technologies are used. Very state of the art, advanced Enjoy working here Nice folks, everything pulls together very nicely. They are very reliant on high tech, but it works nicely most of the time and allows for a very advanced operation. Very flexible schedule. Flexible schedule low salary flatiron Flatiron bought out altos solutions. They are inexperienced in dealing with clients. Should value experience staff. Management not in tune Great work environment Flatiron Health is the best job I ever had. Very chill work environment. Catered lunch everyday, unlimited PTO. They also allow you to flex your hours. They offer free health/dental/vision to permanent employees. Give you a macbook when you start (not to keep). Office is very spacious and in a good location in the city. Trains are right out front. Just all in all a great place to work! Great management, office culture, perks Can't really think of any Good company doing great things to combat cancer Flatiron is an impassioned startup, working towards great goals: to enable data to help cure cancer. When they purchased Altos Solutions in 2014, having a Electronic Medical Report product that was cancer focused did a lot towards those goals. The company is innovating, moving forward with energy and enthusiasm, and aggressively pursuing its end game of gathering data to solve cancer. Still very much a startup environment. A good, collaborative environment. Free lunches at main office. Does not treat its remote workers and its older workers with as much respect as they could.

Company provides laptop. Work life balance Sometimes run out of tasks 10 Good company to work for People are professional and inclusive Work is flexible. Managers are responsive. Efficiency is constantly rewarded with bonuses. Con is software idles Really quick making it necessary to clock out for restroom breaks. Aside from that, overall good company to work for Flexible Flexibility in work hours is great! Interview process was simple. Only downside is sometimes tasks run out, but for the most part, you can easily do the minimum number of hours. Overall great workplace Everything is by email.

The company has a great vision. Great opportunity for extra money with a great company Abstractors have a flexible schedule. Plenty of unpaid PTO and you accrue paid PTO as well. HR has been very responsive when I needed them. Interesting work, I've learned a lot. It can be hard and it's very detailed oriented but even when I've made mistakes it was handled well by HR. Great Part time job for oncology nurses I’ve been a part time (10-18 hrs weekly) remote abstractor for 3 years. It’s been great to work with a company that has such a noble and exciting purpose.

Salesforce|" Productive and Fun Workplace Have good experience everyday. Learned new subjects. Has a great management. Good friends to find. New things to learn all the time. 2 Energetic, enthusiast, life changing environment. Incredible culture that empowers growth and provides resources to make you healthy and successful. Strong teamwork, fun environment and powerful values. A dreamjob I just like very much the company dynamics which makes me grow at a high pace and makes me stretch my knowledge. I joined right after my MBA and still fill that everything I learned in the MBA is really implemented in the organization. Contribute to the business of the customers Amazing culture/people, but work/life balance depends on group Generally speaking, Salesforce is a fantastic place to make an impact, grow your career, and have opportunities outside of your specific role. That being said, it's possible to get stuck in situations where you feel like you're drowning or unable to advance. Salesforce encourages moving around within the company, so it's really up to you to own your destiny. In the technology groups, it's can be difficult to gauge your performance or path to promotion. Annual reviews lack structure (or don't exist), individual development plans are not taken into consideration, or you're swept to a new manager right when you've built a relationship with your existing manager. Great benefits for families, CEOs, flex-work Maintaining CSAT overwhelms ability to execute vision, knowing where/how to find resources can be overwhelming Bad territory PIP Got PIP at mulesoft. Manager did not help much wuth helping me achieve target. Remote is great, a lot of flexibility. Coworkers were good. Great benefits. Better off elsewhere Company is full of politics and obsessed with brand image oppose to providing high quality products/services. Culture is still very much majority focused with fake caring about minorities. Low pay for work and stress levels. Better paying tech companies elsewhere. Amazing community to be a part of! I started my career at Salesforce in Sales and moved into recruiting after two years. I absolutely loved my time in the Sales organization, and it's true what they say about getting your ""Salesforce MBA"" - the way they teach you to approach a sale/company is incredible! It is a heavy coaching culture and you learn so much not only from the management but most importantly from your peers. I never felt like I was the smartest person in the room, and was ALWAYS learning. It's pretty typical in terms of a sales role in regards to the day to day, but it's the approach and type of partnership we offer that truly sets us apart. I did always want to move out of Sales since I had started in it 5 years prior, but had not found the right opportunity. Learning the culture, products, organization and overachieving in my sales role allowed me to create excellent relationships with my manager and upper management, and through networking and with their blessing I was able to secure a role in recruiting, which I absolutely love - it's so fulfilling bringing others into a company I love so much, and promoting equality and inclusive hiring practices along the way! The community of incredible people is truly what makes this such a special place - everyone is always so willing to help here. It is definitely a place where you work hard, but they do a good job of providing breaks/time off to mentally recharge! They are also incredibly supportive of having a family which has made my transition into motherhood so much easier. I can't imagine working anywhere else! wellness reimbursement, free snacks, family planning benefits, job stability, healthcare benefits, Pto, Sto, Vto, Espp, 401k matching Challenging and fast paced Great place to work if you are looking for a place that is a large enterprise, complex, challenging, and extremely fast in execution. Pay is great, benefits are holistic. Management is extremely supportive. Good sales training provided At Salesforce you will develop quickly with a great training program for Sales. There isn't much room for quick growth however and many employees with leave to progress at another company and come back in at a higher position which would have taken much longer had they stayed in Salesforce. Salesforce Embodies the Value of Trust Trust is a core value at Salesforce and it drives all of our business and interactions. This culture of trust promotes honest and open feedback and strong business relationships. remote work Some corporate red tape I love working for salesforce and these are the one of the best 5 years of work I love working for salesforce and these are the one of the best 5 years of work. They are very particular about the work life balance. I love their survey and the way the they act on the survey results Best culture there can be I haven’t been really stressed in 7 years of working at Salesforce. We’ve had conflicts and problems and deadlines, sure, but in the end most colleagues are decent human beings with a great sense of humor. The downside is slowness of change - it’s hard to make radical change given the importance of people’s well-being Great Company to Work for They really care about you and don't know of a better group to work for. They really do have a positive culture. I have been places they say that and don't really have one. Innovative and smart people You will brush shoulders with some of the best in industry. Good benefits and compensation plan. Employee friendly. Takes care of life stage needs.. with niche benefits like - fertility treatment over and above normal insurance Incredible experience, insane work ethic First off, salesforce is amazing to work at. Whether you're just getting started or well into your career - you will learn so much and you will get the recognition. But you're expected to be 100% on all the time, no excuses. It gets a little boiler room at times and you have no voice Incredible company to work for with many opportunities to grow and learn. If you crave a fast-paced environment, a product portfolio that continues to evolve and grow, team selling at it's finest, accountability and a commitment to win, then you will be a great fit at Salesforce. Sales roles are not for the faint of heart and will challenge even the most experienced to up-level their skills. If you're willing to push yourself, the success and career opportunities will be there. Great Culture, Great Product, Great People, Great Compensation Work/Life balance can be a challenge Great company - maybe getting too big I've been here a while, have had a great career here. Things are getting complicated. Too many reorgs too often. Difficult to stay prioritized with too many competing and ever changing initiatives. Lots of change in product and engineer leadership lately. A serious changing of the guards happening. Great ethics, benefits, flexibility, comp No funding for anything, do more with less is the mantra Amazing place to work! Have worked at Salesforce for 5 years and have really enjoyed my time thus far! Great company, culture, people and environment. The company really values its employees. wellness benefits, work/ life balance, culture, offices have snacks and drinks pay internal promotes less than external; a lot of internal meetings that consume your days Great for working moms I have had two kids while working for Salesforce and the environment for new and expecting parents is unparalleled. Not only do we have amazing benefits but more there is a great sense of community for supporting each other during the good and tough times of being a parent. At Salesforce I always feel like a person first and not just a cog in a big machine. I think this comes directly from the Top. Leadership is totally blind and very political. I was given lots of work on my 2nd day of onboarding with 7 days of delivery time. Then another project with closed timelines and as soon as it was done, they moved me out of the program. I suffered so much mentally after being an over achiever and delivered so much in shortest time. Great culture, products, customers, and C-suite vision Great culture, products, customers, and C-suite vision. I've worked here for 5+ years and seen the Salesfroce transform into a large-yet-still-innovative company. Productive and Fun Workplace Have good experience everyday. Learned new subjects. Has a great management. Good friends to find. New things to learn all the time. 2 You can do what you want Fake reviews. Not what is promised. Get ready to drive for nothing and be penalized. High pressure sales with an unknown environment where most people don’t want you there. 2 A Rare blend of Innovation, Corp Culture, Benefits & Work-Life Balance Salesforce has provided me unparalleled opportunities for Personal & Professional Growth, Career Advancement, Training, & manageable work-life balance Love Salesforce I started 6 months ago after working at my previous company for 10 years and will never look back! Great culture and leadership genuinely cares about the wellbeing of their employees I feel valued and love the company's values I really like working for a company that has values that I care about (specifically, sustainability and equality). It's great having the resources we need to get our work done - computer hardware and VMs, but also education when we need it, travel when it's needed, and so on. The planning process is generally clear and transparent, which makes it easy to understand what you're working on and how that fits into the overall company strategy. Salesforce has a strong focus on having data that backs up decisions. As a performance engineer, where data is the core of my job, I find this very refreshing. The Salesforce Raleigh office has an amazing culture, Salesforce Raleigh is a place where everyone feels helpful and welcoming. Salesforce makes a lot of effort on ""fun"" activities which just aren't important to me. You can be your authentic self and be appreciated for it At Salesforce, everyone is valued for their initiative, effort, and contribution, and respected for their diversity. It is really a unique culture with a positive vibe. Great team culture Great workplace culture. All of my coworkers across the organization, even outside of my discipline, are incredibly professional and have always been positive, kind, and supportive. People here really go out of their way to help each other out and create a good team culture where everyone feels heard, respected, and supported. Excellent company to work with I have a great team which feels like a family. Very cooperative, flexible timings, Good management. Great office locations and spaces. Helps in personal growth with helping company grow. Helps in training skills that I need to master, Cannot complain about anything. Privileged to work in worlds top companies family like people, good skill enhancement, best company Frequent org changes Pull back the veneer and you'll see the ugly truth I worked for Salesforce for about two years. Within that time I noticed a cultural change towards ultra liberal progressivism which was then mainstream within the office and constantly shoved down our throats doing activities or meetings that took away from work time which we would later need to make up by staying late or coming in early. Management is the typical fake friend who only promotes a** kissers. I did learn some useful skills and insights there however they lied about promotion time and would switch around our metrics & compensation more than expected for such an ""amazing"" company. By the end of it all I was so burned out I quit the job and then moved across the country to restart my life. Take with that what you will. I now run my own company successfully in South Florida and regret nothing Decent Pay, Good Benefits, Smart People Fakeness Everywhere, Constant Micromanagement, Promotions Based on Brown Nosing or Race, Constant Ultra Liberal Propaganda Progressive Company That's Not Without Flaws I love the fact that Salesforce has fully embraced hybrid work. Still working through the teething pains of project delivery in a hybrid environment, but it's getting better. If you don't want to be in the office 5 days a week, value working for a company that encourages giving back to the community and truly embraces being mindful, then Salesforce is for you. Employee focused, very inclusive environment, progressive on social causes Rapid growth, usual struggles with being able to scale Grateful to be at Salesforce Salesforce is a company that cares about you and about the world. Work-wise, your happiness depends on the team you are on and on your manager, but as things move fast here, you are never stuck in the same situation for too long. An imperfect company that's working hard everyday to get it right A typical day at work generally calls for problem-solving. The problems are never the same, but most of the time, there is a clear process or framework for the journey from problem to solution. There are tools that will help you set goals, challenge yourself, and navigate your career. The management does send down heavy-handed requirements sometimes, but most of the work is done on teams with clear charters and areas of ownership and those teams are generally able to make their own plans in line with the technical direction of the organization. The company leads with values and integrity. They don't always get it right, but they try every day to improve. When they get it wrong, they learn and adapt. Used to be the industry standard, but no more I came to Salesforce because of their stellar reputation as being a company full or intelligent, hard working, community focused people. Over the years, the company's values, commitment to community as well as its employees' well being and work life balance has deteriorated and it's now all talk and no action. Executive leadership is non-transparent and not trust worthy. Unless you are part of the inner circle, you are left out when it comes to promotions, raises and bonuses. It's a shame to see such a great company come crashing down. Flexible work location Over-worked, under-paid, impossible to get promoted, too much backstabbing and politicking. A company with clear values that even my family appreciates I have an intense job in a dynamic environment. Executive leadership is incredibly talented and committed. This is a company where you feel respected and valued. Best company I've ever worked for; they truly value their employees Salesforce values it's employees, and they prove it with their generous pay and benefits. They also provide floating holidays, ""wellness"" days throughout the year (averaging 1 per month) since the pandemic. They really care about their employees' mental health and work/life balance. When in the office, there is free food & beverages including a starbucks-like cafe, alternative spaces to work, and private rooms for meetings and phone calls. None, this is a great company and everyone feels privileged to work there. Salesforce lacks equality and pays less than standard Typical day at work is fine - little micromanagement and my co-workers are friendly. Management is really young here, and our team has two brand new managers. It really shows by how they've hired our team; nothing about our team is equal right now; pay, level, nothing. It's very up in the air and feels like a popularity contest to say the least. Work/life balance would be fine, but it's really not that great when they keep tacking on additional job duties and responsibilities but not offering raises or promotions. Across the board we have severe burnout, and it was even noted in the annual employee survey. It's nice to have a day off for wellness, and $100 stipend for the gym.....but where does that really get you when your pay sucks and management doesn't do anything to fix the problems of inequality among team members. It baffles me still that trust/equality our part of our top core values. I don't trust salesforce anymore because they just tell you what they want you to hear, but don't follow through on promises. Great people great benefits Fun place to wor with some truly incredible people. Some managers over the years have been exceptional, some have been darn right horrid. Many opportunities to network, learn and develop and move around. Great CEO and positive environment in most part. Excellent company outwardly exposure Mid Management -equality fairness is low, opportunities to offer for promotion is low. Baises on Age and race prevalent. 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Pleasantly surprised with how agile Salesforce is given its size. Salesforce makes a strong effort to empower and make individuals heard in the organization. Great leadership with a vision to make the world better through technology. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Being a product specialist, you have very little downtime. I am always on meetings (often back to back) throughout an entire day with customers or needing to work on other initiatives. Pivoting between different business verticals is challenging, stressful, but also fun. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Great. While every company posts about initiatives ""they are doing"" or ""how much they care"", Salesforce actually commits to making the environment better for it's employees regardless of background/beliefs/orientation etc. From a business perspective, it's very fast paced. Smart people and great benefits, burnout is real This is the longest job I’ve held in my nearly 20 year career for a reason. People are generally smart and hard working, so you’re not dealing with laziness and apathy. But the overachiever mentality also makes people work themselves to the ground, and expectations are high. The company tries to counter that with unlimited PTO, generous leave, mental health and wellness benefits, volunteer opportunities, and equality groups (ERGs), but there’s no mistaking that there is burnout, particularly since the pandemic. Culture is also dependent on your team. I’ve experienced amazing culture, and lackluster culture, but honestly the overall flexibility in work-styles (still able to be remote since the pandemic) and benefits are what ultimately have kept me from joining another company. The constant re-orgs and fire drills in doing things on a crunched timeline for leadership are also tiring. It’s definitely lost most of its scrappy and anything resembling a startup culture, but again if you’re looking for a solid company with overall good culture and job security this is really a great place to be. They still need to work on diversity and transparent and less biased promotions, particularly moving up the ranks and in executive leadership. And (as a white woman), I don’t mean more white women… Good product People know us Lots of advancement Opp Remote work is good Managers can have tough expectations I like but don’t love my job Try it out for yourself. Good options Short breaks Productive and Fun Workplace Have good experience everyday. Learned new subjects. Has a great management. Good friends to find. New things to learn all the time. 2 It's been a great ride! I'm what Salesforce calls a Boomerang. I worked here for two years in 2013-14 that didn't go too well. I returned in 2019 and have been very pleased to see how Salesforce has addressed many of the challenges I had during my first tenure. I am challenged daily, both internally and by my customers. Internally, Salesforce can be a difficult place to navigate. Very virtual and sometimes hard to network. However, we are all on the same team, and I eventually get what I need. My customers expect excellence from me and the company. They expect us to live by our #1 core value, TRUST. I do my best to meet their high expectations and it has led to fantastic, long-term relationships. Salesforce does what it says it will do and survives on its values. This is a great place to work. Great Company to work for The pressure to close is immense but the payoff is more than fair. Some of the support teams lack experience but if you put in the work you will be rewarded 1 Not a good place to be anymore. Stressful, disjointed, high turnover, backstabbing, toxicity. Not a good place to be. Leadership is stressed and the priorities shift constantly. Grew too big too fast maybe. Cool but challenging Salesforce is a pretty cool place to work. My team is full of hard workers. My manager is supportive. Con - Your value is determined by whether or not you hit your quarterly/yearly numbers. Sometimes, it can get a bit overwhelming to keep hitting your goals. Remote working options; benefits Demanding goals; limited supported depending on your team Prepare to be stressed Extremely stressful work environment, vague direction, hope to work you to death and get away with it because they’re “Salesforce”. Great in office snacks though Great place for growth I feel supported by my manager to succeed in my role and receive feedback on my growth areas. The work-life balance is great and I love the people I work with Strong company values that come through in the day to day. As an acquired company, the change is constant. I came into Saleforce via acquisition. Generally, I love the Salesforce values, leadership, and accountability to practicing what we preach. Benefits are good (comparative to what we had before - some are better than others). As an acquisition, there was a lot of enthusiasm at the onset of bringing us onboard, but it tapered off a bit and the constant has been change that comes with big impacts. Likely the nature of an acquisition and I generally like working at this company but it's been a pretty big challenge...not always in a good way. Awesome place to work! great benefit and culture. Cutting edge technology and place to learn and experience and learn new things At Salesforce you are building your career and it's not a ""job"" and ""paycheck"" ! Awesome place to work! great benefit and culture. Cutting edge technology and place to learn and experience and learn new things If you find the right one, your leader will support you 100% Salesforce has changed my life for the better. I feel very fortunate to work here. After working at the company, I switched roles and departments and I'm even happier than I was originally! IMO, Salesforce support cannot be matched. Great Company and Great Culture Great Company culture where you feel included and valued from Hire to retire. Vast area of opportunity to grow with technology or as a peoples leader. Excellent work life balance and Global working culture. You will find many in KoA club(Completed 10 yrs) which inspire others. Work life balance, Great inclusive culture, Trust & Transparency in Management Hierarchy Compensations need to be revised with current Market mostly for existing employees vs new hires, Stock Options allocation and refresh should be revisited Great Company with great culture and benefits I love Salesforce. I get unlimited PTO, I have room to learn and grow, and don't feel stressed. This company is overall great. It's allowing me to really advance in my career and managers want to help just as much! Benefits, Culture, Growth Honest and transparent leadership The leadership is always clear about what is happening inside the company and communicates their decisions. On my team, I feel supported to task risks and given the guidance I need to succeed. Great culture, strong products, excellent career prospects I have always preferred small companies. I thought in large companies it becomes all about politics and not competence. Salesforce is definitely the exception to the rule. Everyone I worked with - and I've worked with many different teams over my 10-year tenure - was smart, hard-working and considerate. I still recall one meeting where one colleague was rude to another because it was so unusual, and that rude person was soon unemployed. There are so many products and opportunities that the possibilities for advancement and learning new skills are virtually unlimited. Salesforce is a company with principles and values. One of the most important for me was the 1-1-1 model (1% of product, equity and hours are support charitable endeavors). It has many programs, but the most significant for me were matching gifts and 56 hours of paid time off to volunteer. They support diversity and LGBTQ+ rights. This is a company that supported remote work before it became mandatory, and stepped it up during COVID with things like a stipend to enhance your home workspace and daily wellness classes. The support for parents is the best I've ever heard of, including support for adoption, invitro, etc., and paid paternal leave. I am proud to be a former Salesforce employee and feel it is a shining example of how to create a vibrant, helpful, kind culture. Uplifting work enviornment An excellent work culture that is centered around supporting one another and embracing diversity. If you are ever in doubt, there will always be someone you can turn to for help and answer questions. Overall great workplace actively trying to improve I really enjoy working at Salesforce. I was acquired in via another company and was initially skeptical. Over the last 6 years I've become such a cheerleader for this company! And I didn't expect that. I am consistently presented with opportunities to learn and grow in my career, and encouraged to explore skills both within and outside of my core capabilities/responsibilities. My team is great to work with and I feel like my manager is actively invested in my growth and wellbeing. She is one of the core reasons why I am proud to work here and why I don't want to leave. The hardest part of my job is deciding how much time and energy I want to put into advancing up the ladder. It's kind of nice because if a lot of stuff is going on in my personal life I feel like I can de-prioritize it, but if I really want to get promoted then I need to be actively building a case to do so. Salesforce is committed to employees as stakeholders and walks the walk. Five years at Salesforce have been a continuos learnng experience with good growth opportunities. Managers are incented and generally very good at collaborating with and assisting employees reach corporate and individual goals. Better than other companies I have worked with over the years. Working at Salesforce With more than 20 years of experience, this is easily the best work environment I've ever been part of: safe, non judgmental and supportive. Salesforce's culture promotes learning, team work, work/life balance while modeling great business and human values. Ok company The pros out way the cons but definitely a great place to work for motivated people that are extroverted and love to communicate because there’s an over communication issue at salesforce Great I loved it I made a lot of new professional connections during the 6 months I was there. I was also able to gain as much learning experience as possible Fun workplace Not good enough benefits. But the pay and work culture are amazing. Additionally they do some terrific charity work. Employees are given volunteer time off Productive and Fun Workplace Have good experience everyday. Learned new subjects. Has a great management. Good friends to find. New things to learn all the time. 2 Great culture. Great culture, great managers, room for self development, great DE&I. Decent amount of openings to transition lower level roles to higher roles, so there could be more opps in that respect. Great culture + worklife balance Doesn't pay as much as FAANG Good citizenship at corporate level, but the company is still maturing internally The citizenship aspect of the company, contributing to society is one of the best. In terms of work environment, the company is still developing, it does not yet have the processes and structure to match its market presence. It is very top down driven and the majority of folks just do as they are told. One can have a lot of impact based on individual work. There is a bit of title inflation compared with other companies (for example at the VP level). There is a lot of respect for personal time, so from that angle it is a more relaxed and respectful work environment than other companies (AMZN, MSFT, etc) great offices and work from home policies, philanthropy, ability to do great work do as you are told approach even at VP levels, processes/metric rigor/data driven lags compared to the size and impact of the company 2 Company Values & Fast Pace Salesforce is always doing 'the right thing' by its customers, employees, and the world in general. You will always be learning and growing at Salesforce. The pace of innovation is fast, so at times it is hard to keep up! If you're looking for a company that's steeped in cutting-edge tech but also has decent work-life balance, Salesforce is a great place to work. I've worked for Salesforce for over two years now in the same position. I started before the pandemic and from day one felt connected to the work culture here. I'm always learning as I work. In my org, work-life balance is highly encouraged and with the integration of Slack, it's easy to step away from the desk for a few. The pay is pretty high for my non-technical role. I'd only ever consider leaving this company for astronomical pay at a FAANG company. great benefits, good pay, great work-life balance, cultural communities Can't take on outside work Salesforce has great products, strong leadership, a collaborative and supportive culture, and truly cares about its customers and people. Salesforce has been a great place to work and grow a career. Firstly - we have great products. I help our customers adopt these products and I have very interesting conversations with our customer leadership who are driving business value on our platform. Secondly - we have great leadership and a culture of leading courageously. I am really inspired by both my direct managers and executive leadership - who care about the people and making it a great place to work. The caliber of people I work with is high, and although everyone is high-achieving they also stay supportive and collaborative, and everyone's successes are genuinely celebrated. We invest a lot in our customers and in our people - and it shows. It's a great size of company to work for: large with some structure but not impossible to navigate. Promotion/ advancement may be easier or more difficult depending on the growth of the group, but I have appreciated all the learning and growth opportunities. It's great to learn about how our products are evolving and how they are getting used by our customers to do innovative and impactful things. Lastly - as a working mom I don't think I could find better balance and support anywhere else. The hours are manageable, I have a lot of support from leadership, and I got promoted twice - both times right around my 6 month long maternity leave - a sign they were investing in me and made me really enthusiastic to come back. Great WFH policies, beautiful offices with free barista bar, snacks. Great maternity and paternity leave programs, great training for leaders and people managers. Depending on group, advancement can take longer. Productive and fun place to work Great place to work, you learn a lot about the platform and people are willing to work. Job is supposed to be on site but has been remote since pandemic started and no one is rushing back. Pay is good. They provided wellness days, fridays off where you get paid regardless, throughout the pandemic. PTO and floating holidays are great. i hear they have snacks in the offices sales is stressful Great leadership & culture. Fast paced work environment. In the past five years here, I've made several observations: I am surrounded by brilliant and hard working people and it feels great to be supported in various work streams that require cross-departmental teaming. Comp plans encourage better teaming among the SE community. This also ensures everyone is elevating their game with support from one another. Salesforce still has a start up feel with a fast-paced environment compared with other software companies of similar size. As the product line expands through new product releases and acquisitions, some job roles have increasing responsibilities for knowing more with each year. This can feel a bit overwhelming at times. There are plenty of trainings available. It just can feel like 'too much' at times. You must prioritize and manage your time & energy. The initial 6 months of onboarding can feel overwhelming. Some thrive and some don't - it takes a bit of patience to fully adapt. Salesforce provided me an opportunity for more personal growth after 3 years by supporting my desire for an internal transfer. I take pride in working within a company culture that inspires diversity and inclusion. Salesforce provides many education opportunities for employees to learn about unconscious bias as well as opportunities to get involved and continue learning with equality groups. The intent is there for everyone to have a voice & equal opportunity. Taking time out to volunteer and rest for personal wellness with PTO is highly encouraged. Benefits, culture, compensation, and training opportunities fast-paced, intense onboarding Amazing place to work. Work hard and play hard. The company is always innovating and looking at what works and what doesn't. The culture of adapting to meet our core values is a critical driving factor. I work in customer success and we are always looking for ways to delight and exceed customer expectations. always innovating, always looking for opportunities to help customers get the most out of their investment. Work/life balance - we work hard. Promotions are slow. Salesforce is a great place to work and build a career or work out the remainder of one. Salesforce is an excellent place to work for motivated and talented people who don't need a lot of hand holding to get their jobs done. Strong leadership from the CEO on down provides a solid direction for the company and very clear expectations, but not an environment where you are told what to do rather you are treated like a professional and how you get it done is up to you. The company has tremendous concern for the employees - lots of programs for health and well being both physical and mental. Benefits are excellent as well as very supportive team members. There is a strong culture of Ohana at Salesforce and it resonates throughout all the various departments and functions. There can be a difficult balance at year end but that's expected of any sales focused tech company - thought you are still treated with respect and if you need time take time. Strong leadership. Excellent team members. Very employee focused. None. Very challenging, but my favorite place I have worked. PROS: Gender and racial equality are true priorities. The culture is fun, and Salesforce's events and facilities are second to none. The best in business. CONS: A breakneck pace of work is expected from everyone, across the country. It can sometimes be unsustainable. Org and manager changes are constant. A great introduction to tech as a field overall! During my time at Salesforce I thoroughly enjoyed learning how to utilize the system, as well as a variety of benefits such as snack kitchens on every floor and catered lunches every week (sometimes almost every day depending on what clients we would be setting meetings up for). However, I realized through my position that I was uninterested in office/desk work, which was very beneficial in shaping my future career path, so I am thankful for this position and what it taught me. Free catered lunch, snack kitchens on every floor Work does not excite me! Overall positive experience This was a good internship. The management was all very kind and helpful, being a teenager at the time. I was able to learn from multiple different people on my floor about their jobs as well. Great company and great culture. Once hired, internal compensation and promotions are hard to come by. Overall, Salesforce is a wonderful place to work. My only complaint is they don't practice what they preach when it comes to internal compensation for their existing employees. New hires are paid much more fairly than those who have been there for 5+ years. Great culture, work life balance, flexibility Poor pay for those who are tenured because of no pay adjustments Engaging workplace culture, great work, lots of learning, attentive management, easy to move between teams The things I care about as an engineer are engaging work, continuous learning, growth opportunities, and the ability to step back from work and live a fulfilling life. I have always been able to find this at Salesforce. And in the rare times I haven't, Salesforce has made it easy to move internally to find what I'm looking for. Did an internship here, definitely an amazing company to work for Overall, I had a great experience interning with Salesforce over the summer. They paid well for my position, and they offered a lot of great perks for interns. My manager and team were very supportive, and everyone in the organization was very helpful and were available to chat. lots to learn and do and see i believe that the workplace is overall good there are some times that are not addressed at lower levels. My management team is great and I enjoy what i do. Amazing work/life balance I work cross-functionally with other teams on a daily basis, so there's a lot to learn. My co-workers are all really nice people, that can also get the work done. Institutional knowledge is greatly appreciated in my position, but I sometimes find myself wanting to work on something new. Work can get stale if you don't take the initiative to look, but management encourages it. Prodective and fun workplace Great place to work. Very supportive people. Everything organized. Transparent management system. -Unparalleled team, benefits, and overall company culture -Tons of room for upward mobility/growth -Work/life balance and overall flexibility -Leadership Best Company in the world Couldn't be a better place to work. The onsite work is flexibile, pay is very fair and the people are all so smart, kind and welcoming. It's the best place to be! Micro management and managing out employees Toxic culture. I was managed out rather than being taught and coached. I wanted more support instead I was discouraged and fell into depression. I felt I wasn’t able to do something the “right way”, even though that right way is just an opinion... a bias Benefits Untrustworthy managers Productive and Fun Workplace Have good experience everyday. Learned new subjects. Has a great management. Good friends to find. New things to learn all the time. 2 Everything is great I quitted just because I wanted to change my job role. I satisfied the nice colleagues, salary, benefits and so on. If I have an opportunity of the new role, I'd like join the company again. Almost everyghing long company training 1 1 Salesforce is a great place to work There is always something to learn. There is always someone to ask. There are always challenges. You are in control of your career and there are endless possibilities if you put forward the effort. working remotely, compensation, work-life balance you need to understand and respect the culture Great company that treats their employees well, but the corporate culture is a bit much Only complaints after working there for several years has been that the corporate culture is drilled into everyone a little much, but if you avoid drinking the company kool-aid it's a great place to work. Depends on your team, over all lots of learning & innovation I've really enjoyed meeting people from around the world while working from my couch. The workload fluctuates-- first 3 months were absolutely crazy. Unclear expectations for contractors (at least on my team). Advancement can be affected by changes that happen many levels above you. You can learn lots of transferable skills, and generally have fun at meetings. For first time professionals this can both be a leg-up and a challenge. The only constant really is change. Very nice people Ambiguity, not a lot of time to get comfortable, always changing Intensity of change This is a company of overachievers. As such you are constantly applying pressure to yourself to help the organization and keep up with the highly talented people at Salesforce. Amazing culture, great place to learn Intensity can be too much at times. Great work culture Due to the pandemic, a typical workday was coffee, meetings, and logging in while wearing my PJs. It was a great virtual experience with my team and supervisor. Profitable company that innovates frequently Salesforce is a fast-paced company with 3 releases a year, which means constant learning or you fall behind quickly. Working on account teams can be stressful because they don't train their staff well on their roles. Bureacracy has grown tremendously as the company has grown, and the company is now comparable to an Oracle or SAP rather than a nimble start-up. However, they do acquire companies frequently and shift around R&D resourcing frequently so there's constant change. There's a big focus on equality and company culture, therefore if you like the culture you'll have many opportunities to do extra curricular activities related to giving back to the community or participating in special focus groups. Good pay, promotions can still be had if you work hard Bureaucratic, process heavy 6/5 stars Work life balayage is like no other, benefits are too notch, they take time to train their managers to be able to help HUMANS, not robots, you feel well respected and heard even as a new hire. I don’t know how I could ever leave this company, they are amazing! Salesforce is truly a great company to work for From the amazing compensation to working with some of the most like-minded individuals I've ever met. Salesforce cares. The support I was provided with throughout my time there was excepcional Incredible place to work Salesforce has been a great place to grow my career. I am well supported by my manager and my team in addition to having easy access to resources that enable me to deepen relationships with our customers and my peers. I love our mission and the value system here at Salesforce. Additionally, I am fortunate to get to work alongside smart, talented and compassionate people. Amazing company to work for! Salesforce is the real deal! It has an amazing culture and they offer me opportunities, pay, and benefits that I wouldn't be able to get any other place. I was weary before I joined if they could live up to the hype, but the rumors are true!! Pay, Benefits Work-life balance can be tricky since it is a global company Back stabbing and cut throat culture while claiming we are all ""family"" My first 2 years I was very excited to be part of such a caring company. But then I found out that that is just a farce. I did learn a lot and the pay was good but a year later I am still dealing with the PST of the last year. Great benefits, Great pay Sales people willing to throw you under the bus A great place to build a career I've been at Salesforce since graduating college and it's been an incredible place to grow a career. I have moved between engineering and product organizations and get to work on some incredibly innovative problems. The people I work alongside are incredibly talented and very respective of both your time and mental health. Salesforce is probably one of the best employers in the world when you factor in your hourly wage instead of your annual wage. You'll work hard here but you won't be overworked. I will say that the biggest downside is executive alignment. I think Salesforce has not had a moment to change to its ever-increasing scale and there will need to be some shakeups to reduce redundancy and ensure relationship and bridge-building. inclusive and caring environment, the events (when in-person!), the top-floor coffee bars executive alignment, product agility A place built around never ending innovation The only thing that is constant as Salesforce is change. This is a blessing and curse at the same time. Salesforce is a fast pace environment living on the cutting edge. It's challenging and very rewarding. The company culture is awesome, a family-owned mindset where everyone is important. The opportunities are endless and if you have the passion you will be successful. If there is a company that is the example this is it! Career growth, benefits, innovation, respect, work-life balance Constantly looking to do better through re-inventing the wheel at times Innovative company that pushes employees to realize their full potential. Been with Salesforce for 5 years. I've switched teams about once a year (re-orgs) but had roughly the same job duties during that time. The culture is respectful, results driven, and fast pace. I like the people and the management style. I work 100%. Traveled about once per month before the pandemic. Flexible hours. Can be Long Hours Easy to find great managers While individual manager styles vary, I haven't spent more than a month or two here with a manager I didn't work well with. Because you can move around easily you can settle into whatever work environment you like. My managers have been incredibly genuine and they often want me to succeed as an individual more than they want the team to succeed. Time-based flexibility is amazing- everyone understands if you need to take an hour in the middle of the day to go for a run, exercise, or just step away from work. Inclusive Culture, Innovative Solutions Salesforce fosters an environment of inclusiveness, tolerance and mutual respect. Salesforce champions diversity and promotes a healthy work culture. Inclusive culture Great culture of trust and openness There is a high level of trust internally between management and individual contributors within the company. The management consistently promotes the culture of trust to create an open hemisphere. The leadership chain provides a good degree of transparency on actions, decisions, and reasonings on their policies and directions. Employees are welcome to comment and influence the directions. Generally, there is a culture of openness within the company. People have a good degree of trust towards each other. It is very common for people to speak up without the fear to be retaliated against or isolated. Volunteer time off, Support for career trainings, Good cash bonus, Good work life balance, Positive work cultures Low amount retention stocks, limited work commute assistance Great culture and motivated employee base My team is very flexible and allows me the flexibility to work from anywhere and at any time as long as the work gets completed on time. Management is very understanding but at times the consensus-driven culture of the Company can get in the way of moving quickly. Lovely company to work for Nothing to complain about honestly. Very encouraging environment with all the necessary support needed to succeed with assigned tasks. Great company culture! Ahona!"
Zoom Video Communications, Inc.| Productive and fun place to work I would definitely recommend anyone who likes administrative work to work here. This place is awesomeness in a nutshell. I had the best time working there on a temporary basis. Unfortunately they didn't have a position for me as I was covering for a maternity leave. Within that short time, I felt liked I belonged. Fun ride while it lasted Used to be an amazing company but is now struggling with a post-pandemic world. Sales targets are now impossible and the team grows more corporate by the day. Run and don't look back Zoom is an exhausting place to work. Total fire drill culture all the time. Execs don't care about employee burnout, only the almighty dollar. They say that Zoom is all about delivering happiness but that does not apply to employees. The stock was the only positive thing but even that's tanking. Benefits are decent but no 401k match, which is basically standard at every company. Seriously, if you enjoy any kind of work/life balance, avoid Zoom like the plague. 5 1 Much busy with the pandemic Things have gotten a lot busier with the pandemic which has certainly changed all lot about the entirety of certain positions...overall though it is a positive environment. Job security Too busy Great Company Love this company the management is great with constant career developing conversations per week. The experience is everything at a company like this. Free Lunches Great Management Team Events Career Advancement Net positive employer and experience Great job environment. Little / no ceiling based on work ethic and goals High expectations Horizontal and vertical flexibility Best product in the genre Free meals, great benefits Can experience work/life balance issues depending on role and personal goals Lack of Transparency Its a start-up. Be wary. Severe lack of transparency and they lure you in with extra benefits to drink the Koolaid. Managers are young and over-look potential to maximise an employees potential and work experience.

Acuitus|" The Sky is the Limit! This internship and job advancement opportunity is fantastic! The learning environment for cutting edge work w/i the IT industry is above anything else I have engaged. The real world issues that arise prepare and involve my entire knowledge, skills sets, and experience, and expands those areas immensely. The interaction with management and leadership has been exemplary. It is all about the pursuit of excellence and the advancement of technology to improve the systems in which we Live! 1 Interesting product that does a great job of teaching IT basics. Kind of boring place to work, did not talk much with co workers. Mostly interacted with immediate team and only focused on the job. Learned a lot about IT and troubleshooting. This is an Internship that has given me the skills needed when no previous IT production experince. This has given me the skills needed during the pandemic, if you have no previous knowledge or are a student looking to get the edge on virtual experience that will be applied to the real world this is the place. The only thing I can complain about is some of the IT monitors that manage your work do not elucidate some of the work when everything is not literal. Some other individuals will need things worded differently or given examples with a more versed analogy. Just know that this has stipulated agreements and requires communication. Work from Home/Virtualization towards IT experince communication methods 1 Great start of your IT career Big shout-out to the Acuitus program and their hardworking team. My time at Acuitus has been full of challenges and interesting cases. It taught me how to problem solve, learn new concepts, and how to apply them to real world situations. The program was hands down worth the long hours and sleepless nights. The program really knows how to prepare you for real cases, even those rather difficult. I have landed a Network Engineer position at an advanced IT company, which could not have been possible without all the knowledge, skills, and abilities I gained while at Acuitus. You get tons of information and training. Ok This was an ok place to get started in IT. They did promise alot more than what I feel I was given. Not as much mentorship or one on one as I had hoped. We will see if it pays of in the long run. Fast paced energetic challenging supportive IT fun! Acuitus provides an inclusive diverse workplace and learning environment that is both supportive and challenging. There is no micromanagement or unrealistic expectations but it is not the place for uninspired persons as daily tasks and learning require the utmost dedication and love for all things IT. I would highly recommend Acuitus' internship program to anyone wanting to dive into IT for a career. Diverse, Flexible, Remote Recursively reviewing and updating the curriculum and workload. This company is designed to help cultivate critical thinking skills, making it a habit for one to tap into that upper intellectual echelon of conscientiousness where clear ideas are noticed and new ideas are conjured, and then implemented. Training is unparalleled in the IT field. Due to COVID19 different IT tasks overlapped in an unorganized way. Small company, lots of potential I believe that the ""Digital Tutor"" software currently being built by Acuitus has the genuine potential to change the landscape of education in this country. Having tested and used the software extensively, I think it is an intuitive, clever, and user-friendly product that will, if slowly, become more and more popular as it is able to prove its usefulness in ""educational"" environments of all types. I find that the management and engineers both, really seem to agree that the Digital Tutor has value and merit and the workplace culture is full of enthusiasm for the work and product being built. The hardest part of my job is being able to effectively communicate to engineers, product development, and management, bugs/issues/improvements to the Digital Tutor software. The Tutor is highly complex, with many moving pieces, and as a tester, communicating my proposed improvements and fixes to the software can be tricky at times. Fortunately, most o the staff understands this and I find communication between various departments in the company to be very fluid and smooth, teamwork is high at Acuitus.

DICK'S Sporting Goods|" Best Company you'll ever work for and best Job you'll ever have! Dick's Sporting Goods cares deeply about its employees (teammates). They clearly recognize this as the greatest asset and go above and beyond when it comes to inclusivity, work-life balance, training, and competitive compensation. The job isn't always easy, but Dick's recognizes that and makes sure every teammate is appreciated and equipped to succeed on the job and in life. Besides having fun at work, I could be any prouder of my company and I think that sentiment is universally transmitted to how we interact with our customers (athletes). 7 The coworkers are the best but not good pay and bad management Its a fun place to work at but the management can be rude at times and don't really care for you. The pay isn't good considering they'll have you covering 3 different departments of the store by yourself if they don't schedule right. Great people to work with The people there were wonderful to work with, and were always very kind, and supporting. many benefits and special things were provided, but it is hard work. good and fun it’s cool yanno all that be dope i guess ion know. one manager was like a pimple you just wanna scratch off i will say that. dude was always munching on my meat. but co workers cool Not valued Managers care more about customers than the workers. Expect to do so much even though you’re getting payed the bare minimum. There’s a lot of favoritism and you can see. Short breaks, under appreciated, overworked, underpaid, favoritism good/bad I did not enjoy my work experience at DSG what so ever, they lacked management and responsibility it was poorly constructed as a whole. They are not flexible to any extent. I had put a request in mid way through the week for Saturday off and was declined, I understand that but A week ahead of time and still declining. The ""Managers"" or what has been chewed up and spit out as the DSG manager which is what was we had, its nothing. They're not respectful at all and will bash you as well as talk to other employees about you. I do not recomend this job, Stay far away from it. None All Fun workplace but unfair treatment Fired because I couldn’t come in during a tropical storm also felt targeted by one of the shift managers but other than that it was an easy job, usually busy during holidays of course Boring Long Hours I liked the job for the first couple of weeks, but then it became really slow and boring If it wasn't back to school or holidays. It's a good job for teens if you are into jobs that are slower-paced. A typical day for me as a cashier (also cross-trained) would be obviously completing transactions with customers, and keeping snacks stocked. Then most times when we were slow and had too many cashiers, I would help out on the sales floor with ""recovery"" which consisted of placing merchandise in the correct areas, cleaning dressing rooms and helping with trucks sometimes. I can say one good thing which is scheduling, they are pretty flexible especially if you are in school. Oddly stern on discount Don’t let them catch you buying anything for anybody. The microphones get used as a place only full time employees get to talk on. Also you’re not allowed to chew gum while working there. Eh The coworkers are great for the most part and the job itself is tolerable. The pay is not great and sometimes the management is lacking. Overall it’s a decent job. Not bad Not great. Cliques galore. Favorites rule the space and management is very open about their desire to make themselves look good, no matter who suffers in the interim. Alright It’s an alright work place. There’s a huge disconnect between corporate and stores, so that doesn’t help at all. From gameplans to customer service, there’s a disconnect. For example, online customer service has no idea what stores are actually able to do, so they often mislead Athletes (customers) which leads to a whole different conversation. Accountability is always and will always be an issue. I love that Dick’s is inclusive though. That’s a big win, and I love that. But that disconnect definitely has a negative impact on one’s mental health. A work-life balance doesn’t really exist, even though they say they care about that. The company does do a lot of innovating though, and that’s a promising thing to see. Wonderful for a while, but… For about 2 years i loved this job, and I was promoted fast due to my production on a daily basis. I loved the people, and some of which are friends for life. However, this company has really started not caring for its managers from an executive level. they preach work life balance then make you work a 70 hour week. it’s patently ridiculous. the executive team only cares about cutting corners, and putting more on associates and managers’ plates without extra compensation. district managers are the same way. obviously everyone is replaceable, but no company needs to mention it in meetings the way this one does. Coworkers and job were okay, bad compensation and awful management/corporate The customers you deal with are overall regular for retail. The job itself was pretty regular cashier and floor work, stocking shelves and fixing clothes and helping people. I didn’t have a problem with much of that. The management was very falsely positive with us and would always push rewards percentages and how many protection plans and such we sold. Would make you feel bad if you didn’t hit green even if you were barely on register that week. You could tell corporate didn’t care at all about any of us. Got paid the lowest they could legally give me in my state and still they wanted me to bust my butt selling stuff for things like gift cards. They also cut hours, which is what ultimately forced me to quit. Went from about 24hrs a week to 6hrs a week. Strong family values/ support Both emotional and financial support during a family y crisis. Flexible with my schedule to help me during this time. They continued to help me through that time Horrible environment to work in, expected to work long hours with few breaks, management is unreliable. This store cannot keep a store manager for more than 3 years. Its a revolving door with associates as well. The environment is clicky, very gossipy, and very little respect given to eachother. You are never asked about how you feel about something, you are just told to do it and suck it up. It is probably the worst work environment you will ever experience, the managers dont care about you whatsoever, they all expect you to work mass amounts of overtime (even the minors who are associates). I once worked a 16 hour shift, and if i wanted to leave early they were gonna give me a point. Oh yeah, the point system has no grace. One call off = one point, late is the same. Even if you are actually ill, your getting a point and eventually you'll get fired. Dont bother trying to take a break, you wont get one. And dont be surprised if you walk up on your manager talking bad about you to another associate. None. All of it. fun job the work environment is super fun and everyone feels like family. coworkers and management are all kind and good at what they do. you get paid well for how easy the job is. would 100% recommend for a first or part time job Serious changes need to be made before employees can feel comfortable and energized in that work environment Blame goes straight past management and right to the hourly employees. Morale is at a constant low. Key carrying leads are only considered managers when it’s convenient for the store. Simply being at work on time and consistently is never enough. Instead, employees are not only expected to come in early, on their days off, etc… Associates are ridiculed and talked about behind their back when they don’t. Recognition for good work is only given if it is noticed by a higher up (district manager or another store manager). Anyone who starts out as part time refuses to take a promotion because they see how full-timers are treated. Overall, dicks sporting goods insists on treating employees with respect and having a work/life balance, but the individual stores have issues with carrying this out. Good pay with experience Breaks not guaranteed, petty management, overworked for little pay. It’s ok at first I’ve been at DSG for a year now, that’s all I gave myself to be there. It was ok at first but then it dragged on. So management only cares about credit cards, customer sign ups and protection plans. And not enough about their employees and their needs. Like every job at some point. But what really took me over is the fact that doing a replenishment job in 30 min, with 69 times to fine, is not realistic. Especially when 100% of the times are hanging from the ceiling and a manger got mad at me for being slow. You try going up and down a 9ft ladder and getting called left and right to help folks, and not getting it done. It’s hard and they ask too much for $12.50/hr. Not enough hours either. Supportive environment, great people Great pay and surrounded by great people. Management is constantly improving and works with employees. Competitive environment. The store is huge and newer which provide challenges but there is plenty of support to work through them. Fun environment I enjoyed my time working here as I felt like I thrived in the environment of fast pace and helping others. I would recommend working here if you are passionate about sporting goods and willing to help people Best Company you'll ever work for and best Job you'll ever have! Dick's Sporting Goods cares deeply about its employees (teammates). They clearly recognize this as the greatest asset and go above and beyond when it comes to inclusivity, work-life balance, training, and competitive compensation. The job isn't always easy, but Dick's recognizes that and makes sure every teammate is appreciated and equipped to succeed on the job and in life. Besides having fun at work, I could be any prouder of my company and I think that sentiment is universally transmitted to how we interact with our customers (athletes). 7 Poor Management I've worked here for 2 years and the management went downhill. The pay wasn't bad, but I was working in different departments except the one I was hired into. Management has very high unrealistic expectations within the store. Also, management went against my availability numerous times and scheduled me on days I couldn't work. i like my job yea u should work here, its fun you make good friends. pay is great. they’re really flexible with hours, especially if you’re in school. 25% discounts, lots of growth opportunities. Great company to work for. Great company to work for. Cares about their associates. It is best to be a team player and work together to achieve goals. Different from other retail stores because of how much the company cares about their employees. Management is understanding and will work with your schedule. Strong customer service skills will help you succeed in any department within this store. Pay is pretty fair for the given tasks. Good pay but can be a lot of work Pay is good but it’ll take them awhile to get you on equipment even if interested. Plus the point system is a drag wish they change it and give more flexibility Workplace Good job fun but busy all the time . Day to day is always on your feet and running around but at the end of the day not a bad job and the discount is a perk Ability to quickly advance Working at DSG has given me numerous opportunities to advance and depending on your manager, pay increases come often. Coworkers are awesome - keep a positive attitude and you will excel. Work environment, Put in the work - you will advance None Never once did I think that I was going to be excited to go to work, the environment that my coworkers create is so inviting and fun. Dick’s Sporting Goods has not only become my job but has become my home. Everyone makes this job so fun and nobody is judged for anything. A day at work for an Apparel Associate is making sure all of our clothes look good and everything is in order. But our main focus is customers, our company is huge on customer service so we make sure no one needs help with anything. This could include looking up an item for an athlete or helping them into a fitting room! 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? The pay and management What is the most stressful part about working at the company? I achieved enough money to buy my first car What is the work environment and culture like at the company? It was very connected to Humble friendship What is a typical day like for you at the company? 10 hours a day 4 days a week sometimes overtime Terrible place to work Management was not helpful or friendly, they don't care about their employees. They allow people to slack off and not do their job to just have a extra body in the building. Amazing people there but management needs help I worked at dicks for 5 years and when I first started things were horrible they didn't know what they were doing in management and just everyone was stressing everyone. As time went on and a new store manager came things got a lot better but there was still there flaws of course. Management doesn't talk things out with people to much so things get lost and then we would get blamed for it. Overall, I met some of my closest friends there and learned a lot of things in retail! Prepare to be overworked and underpaid Needs an entire new management. Will always be asked to go above what your job description is. With no real reason to other than to get on your managers “good side”. Favoritism is a huge part of this job. 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? The people you meet What is the most stressful part about working at the company? The higher ups micromanage pretty hard but when you learn the why its not as bad What is the work environment and culture like at the company? The best seriously best company i have ever worked fof What is a typical day like for you at the company? High energy moving a lot. need more security for the store for our stores. working with positive people and learning, the materiel work sport has a great learning of all goal in the field, and what make a the job easy too achieved. Fun place to work Great team to work with. Flexible schedule. Merchandising and doing sets was enjoyable. The job was different everyday and was able to travel and work at a lot of different stores. Absolutely no work life balance. It’s unfortunate that the company preaches no black out dates for requests off and work life balance yet salary managers will Work no less than 10 hour days and still be expected to work even longer when last minute “visits” pop up and random fires. Our store management is drained and nothing seems to even be done with it despite how many company engagement surveys come out asking for our “honest feedback”. Pay is not worth the 50 hour work week of constant issues and stress with little to no support. Challenging No work life balance, pay not adequate to time spent at work. Stressful Dicks sporting goods is a tough place to work. They preach great core values but they do not put their money where their mouth is. Compensation is fair in my opinion Bad and scattered workplace Management does not care about their workers. It has created a hostile and angry environment, my manager was angry and would do dumb things that jeopardized people. Productive workplace I always thought it was a really fun place to work, I got along well with coworkers and management. The only downside I would say is that it was difficult to move around to different positions in the store. Tight-Knit Family In my tenure with Dick's Sporting Goods, I have worked in several stores in every position from cashier to management. No store atmosphere ever compared to Riverhead. I was heartbroken when I moved as the next store was no where near the experience. Joining the Riverhead Dick's Sporting Goods family was the best decision I've ever made. Great work atmosphere 4 stars What is the best part of working at the company? The co-workers What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Deadlines or switching out seasons and getting ready for the customer rush. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? It is a pleasant atmosphere. What is a typical day like for you at the company? It ebbs and flows. Best Company you'll ever work for and best Job you'll ever have! Dick's Sporting Goods cares deeply about its employees (teammates). They clearly recognize this as the greatest asset and go above and beyond when it comes to inclusivity, work-life balance, training, and competitive compensation. The job isn't always easy, but Dick's recognizes that and makes sure every teammate is appreciated and equipped to succeed on the job and in life. Besides having fun at work, I could be any prouder of my company and I think that sentiment is universally transmitted to how we interact with our customers (athletes). 7 Favoritism and underpaid Very boring job with long hours and very little pay, does not accept family emergency call ins. And favorites are a big problem in company. Expected to do jobs that are out of your skill level or job title. Selling sports without being competitive Pretty typical retail position. I started off as an entry level cashier at the Washington Sq. location and became a front end lead in about 8 months (a position I held for nearly 2 years afterwards). Just like anywhere else, you smile at people and ring out the things customers want to buy at the cash registers. You deal with unhappy customers just like anywhere else in a mall. When I became a lead, ugly truths start to reveal themselves. Without divulging company ""secrets"", company goals in comparison to their sales in my region were outrageous. And unfortunately, part-time 16-year olds (basically 70% of your co-workers) don't really care about any of them, so upper management constantly puts pressure on you about goals that are borderline unachievable. Besides that, most of the full-time adults you work with are good people and you are surrounded by sports, so that's cool. Wouldn't recommend working here unless you are under the age of 18 or in management and can put up with teenagers calling out on weekends. Room to advance I enjoyed working there. Can be fast paced depending on the season. DSG'S Customer Athletes are very important to them. They are the true epitome of customer service. Unrealistic and delusional corporate expectations Often only 4 people working because that’s what labor hours we get. Yet we need to have a cashier and a greeter open to close and someone doing Omni so that leaves one person to maintain the entirety of the sales floor, help every customer, do all the gameplans that are due in a short amount of time to reset the majority of a store, and maintain absolute brand standards. And now as if that stress wasn’t enough they are sending secret shoppers in to grade us on how we aren’t perfect with one person on the sales floor. But the expectation is to have everything priced clean merchandised folded and perfect. With only one person able to work on this throughout the day while trying to do every task in the store that needs photos submitted and can never be late but with Zero additional labor hours. We barely have enough labor hours to keep the store open every day I feel the people who make the deadlines and labor hours are disconnected with reality. Pay, Great team of caring people, benefits Micro managing corporation, delusional expectations b Great benefits, low pay I had a good management team at my location. Most issues were from younger staff that didnt care to do their jobs. FFL was a tough position with difficult hours(for me personally). 7am, 2am, and 5am shifts. Was hard to get a good sleep schedule. Benefits were really good. But unless youre a store manager, the pay couldnt support a family. Im sure its fine for a single person. Solid team Store was ran but a very competent and solid management team... They are the top 3 out of all stores in the company across the country. That said. There is pressure to perform and meets matrix standards for sales, warranties, etc Not a great place to work surprisingly So unfortunately, I don't many positives besides a few of the friends that I have made working there. If you are looking for a well-paying job as well as opportunities for raises, you may want to eliminate this company from your job search. Whenever I ask a manager (we have 5) a question about raises or schedule problems, they always say to ask another manager about my problem. The problem with this is that I have asked each manager about my questions. On top of this, the company really does pick and choose favorites. If a team lead doesn't like you, they will make your work life awful in hopes of making you want to transfer departments. Although this hasn't happened to me, I have seen it happen and have been apart of several conversations explaining what they did. I have worked here for over a year, and unfortunately, I am still working here and am in search for another job. Don't make the same mistake I did, and please find another company that will value you and pay you what you deserve. Flexible Low pay, Unfriendly, Poor management 2 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Helping the customers find what they need to enjoy a sport or have fun with friends and family. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? The amount of hours you get is extremely random. Ensuring that you can never be financially stable. They also don't pay well for what they want you to do work wise. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Today work environment is toxic. They allow managers to say horrible things about employees and nothing happens. They play favorites leading to incompetent leaders. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Come into work and make up for the lazy people that work there and still get yelled at for not getting anything done even though nobody else did anything. Good management at store level 1285 has fantastic management at the store level! Best of all is the Store Manager. Higher up management is inattentive when things are good or mediocre. They only intervene when things are bad when the problem has been weeks or even months beyond notice. They are then extremely hands on with unrealistic timelines of improvement with little to no support. Great High School/Part-time Job My experience at Dick's Sporting Goods had some good and some bad. The good were the co-workers, management, and laid back atmosphere. I enjoyed my co-workers there and my managers were very supportive when needed. It was a very stress free job where your activities were low pressure. The bad was unruly customers and pushing credit card sales so hard. Some customers were very rude and it was sometimes hard to just put a smile on your face to deal with them. You will be asked to push credit card sales on customers and that can be annoying. I understand that its a great way to make Dick's sporting goods money but then management should have educated us on the importance of it, and maybe throw in a reward here and there for top performers. Co-workers, Stress free, management Credit card sales, unruly customers It’s a job Working in front end at Dicks can be stressful. Rude customers come in a couple times a week. There’s times different departments won’t come up to help with register when its super busy up front and its only 1 or 2 cashiers, so it doesn’t necessarily feel like a team. You’re expected to ask a lot of questions, eg. protection plans, credit cards, donations. Asking for time off is pretty easy and management is usually understanding if you have to leave. Bad Managers Low Pay Managers hired me for footwear. Showed up and was put in apparel for the rest of my time there.( Apparel has much more work then any department but gets paid the same.) Was told they would get me in to footwear sometimes but never did. Managers picked favorites. A lot of Perk There area lot of perks for working at their corporate office. Full size gym with staff, and cafeteria with quality ( but pricey ) food options. Offer team sports and games to play during the work day. Got to leave early on Fridays during the summer Toxic management On the surface dicks sporting goods seems like a fantastic place to work, and I did enjoy it here sometimes, but toxic managers ruin any chance of this being a good job. In my time at dicks I encountered a manager who screamed at employees for fun, a manager who expected a month's notice for time off, and a manager who made up new rules just to fire associates. If the toxic leadership issue could be resolved Dicks would be a fine place to work, but I doubt that will happen. Easy job, free snacks Toxic leadership. Typical warehouse work It seems to be the focus is mainly on quantity rather than quality. However, the job comes with a lot of benefits and does a lot of fun events for the employees to enjoy. Enjoyable I find that communication and expectations have been very clear while working here. The only problem I have had is that I do not get a work/life balance and that my schedule is all over the place. Communication workload. Work/Life Balance does not exist. Low pay for the amount of hours that is put in. It was a decent place Not really a place where you move up but that's a lof of places it seems these days. Overall my time was decent, nothing too crazy but I was able to get a better job after 3 stars What is the best part of working at the company? The friends and family that you become with your teammates What is the most stressful part about working at the company? For the location I work at is being attached to the mall. Dealing with disrespectful kids/teens that run around throwing balls. The store can get very busy on the weekends and evenings especially footwear. There isn't always enough staff working What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Friendly. The company is very big on inclusion and diversity. We have people from all walks of life and are accepted exactly as they are What is a typical day like for you at the company? Hectic with the amount of things to be done in the time frame the store is open and the over abundance of clothes No respect for YOUR SCHEDULED hours They don’t care about your scheduled hours (mind you, everyone besides “management” is either in highschool or undergrad). Their online scheduling app is a disaster; basically you could go a whole week thinking you have a couple of consecutive days off (after working several consecutive days) and overnight all those off days could be plugged with new hours, worst part is their system refreshes your log in info every 3 months and the only way to fix it is at the store, so it just makes scheduling even worse. The employee hierarchy is hilarious, it embodies corporate structure; frustration and disrespect just trickle down the pay grades. the worst place new hires leave every time. was told i’d get a raise but didn’t. nobody wants to work for 12.50 an hour especially during holidays. managers have changed 20 times over the past year and all care about getting credit cards and not safety or experience for employees. pressure us to leave good surveys on how our work environment is and bribe us with candy LOL. refuse to fire employees that are incompetent or are extremely aggressive. always seeing employees fight and get into arguments. discount isn’t worth all the stuff you have to go through. make you do more than you have to and bring up promotion just to boost productivity. lots of false promises made by ASM and SM. overall, extremely terrible place to work. Best Company you'll ever work for and best Job you'll ever have! Dick's Sporting Goods cares deeply about its employees (teammates). They clearly recognize this as the greatest asset and go above and beyond when it comes to inclusivity, work-life balance, training, and competitive compensation.

Company is doing extremely well which of course means there are lots of opportunities to grow your career. Wonderful company and culture No major cons of any kind here 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? Pays well, cool apparel What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Toxic culture and senior leadership is oblivious too it and HR hides it. Literally had a DM and HR say that’s just “RVP name” being “RVP name”. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Toxic and senior leadership believes it’s wonderful. They are so removed and allow EVP of Ops to destroy the company culture What is a typical day like for you at the company? Stress, getting yelled at, working all day 1 Hello – Our corporate Human Resources team would like an opportunity to learn more about your concerns. Please contact our confidential hotline at (866) 814-2749 and provide your feedback so we can review the situation appropriately. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. Fun products, constantly upset customers, managers working against you Started part time and worked up to Sales Lead. Pay was slightly above avg for retail. The companies absurdly high prices and unfair coupon exclusions create upset customers every single day, they care not to change. Typical day is simply selling products, stocking and doing the job of 10 others with bad mangers being congratulated on poor performance and not held accountable. Probly best for youth and college students Selling fun sports products No accountability for poor performance of management Strong values I've worked for DICK'S over 8 years now. I continue to be amazed at the dedication around being more than just a retail store. We are committed to our core belief that sports make people better and we will make sure every kid gets a chance to play. Every day, I remind myself the bigger purpose and it provides the motivation to do my best. great benefits, flexibility this can be an overwhelming environment for someone who isn't used to the pace of retail That leadership cares about all Teammates I came from outside the company and because Dicks Sporting Goods believes in Education, Development, with shoulder to shoulder training it has been a rewarding, learning and growth experience. Seeing actions that support and reflect the core values of the organization from executives to teammates bringing to life inclusivity, and a bond that is incredibly authentic that brings joy. The best part of being in the Dicks Sporting Goods family is that we are encouraged to chase our dreams. Leadership Challenging and Rewarding Company Retail can be challenging! Dick's Sporting Goods provides an atmosphere that develops each associate to be successful both inside and outside of the organization. They are a highly competitive company that rewards hard work and challenges each individual to think outside of the box The future is bright and I look to retire from this great company! Work hard, play hard environment, & a fun, values-driven company to work for There is a great energy working at a company that is continuing to excel and constantly thinking about what's next & how to do it better. The culture is very supportive across all different business units. There's also an opportunity to take on leadership roles and be entrepreneurial if an initiative interests you and have access to the highest levels of the organization. Our employees, teammates, are viewed as the best resource, so they are continuously invested in. It's also great to work for a company that lives it's values. Rewarding, collaborative, and inclusive environment. The company is more than a place to work. It is a place where you get to make dreams come true. You help to fulfill the dreams of our teammates and the dreams of our athletes. We are not in the business to sell merchandise, we are in the business of making dreams reality. The culture is created from the leadership team, cascaded down to each teammate. All teammates are treated like family which creates a collaborative environment where they are are empowered to be the best versions of themselves. If you are looking for a rewarding career where dreams become reality.. come check us out! Decent Retail Job Its a nice flexible option if your looking for a job in the retail world. Work culture could use quite a bit of improvement, and the pay is not stellar, but there are decent benefits for full time employees. Fun Coworkers, but management can be a little overbearing. I originally applied as a retail associate, but within my first week, I was reassigned as a bike mechanic having little to no knowledge of how to fix a bike. I had to learn everything on the spot about how to fix and service bikes, and the training I received was pretty good, but I still felt like I was just thrown in the mix of things with little knowledge about how everything worked. I often had to look up how to do services and repairs on YouTube, and I was the only employee working in the section called Bikes & Fitness (Essentially two sections in one), and I often felt overwhelmed with the tasks that I had to complete. The management there was good but I often felt like they expected too much from me and thought of me as an expert on fixing bikes, when I literally haven't ridden one in nearly a decade. When I radioed my coworkers to help me assist customers during rushes while I completed the services I needed to do, they also didn't know what to do, unless they had worked there for a long time beforehand. This isn't their fault though, I think that managers should cross-train employees so everyone knows how to do a little bit of everything. I think that they should also put two employees in this section because I would often be bombarded by customers while completing a task that my manager insisted I needed to get done right away. My coworkers were great people, and fun to work with, but my overall experience here wasn't very positive. Great environment that allows you to grow I've worked at numerous retailers and DICK's Sporting Goods is a truly elite environment that encourages growth. The executive team is approachable and accessible which is rare in most corporate environments. Everyone truly cares about the customers and wanting the best for the business. Incredible Company I have been with DICK'S Sporting Goods for nearly 4 years and it has been an amazing journey. The company is committed to creating an inclusive and engaging workplace. They truly care about their employees, our customers and our communities. I'm proud to be a teammate and DICK'S and I'm excited for our future. Great benefits, pay, culture, leadership and of course employee discount! Retail is Relentless Working in retail ranks up there as a close second to working in the food service industry. The pace can be alarming for those coming from different sectors, but the fulfillment & pride is magnified with every accomplishment. This company cares. The culture is people. And if you happen to ask anyone who works at DICK's Sporting Goods 'why have you stayed with the company so long?' amongst a host of reasons, 'the people' will always be mentioned. Here's to another decade The people, culture, and common purpose Retail sector is relentless, so if fast paced work & expectations aren't on your roadmap...make a U turn Purpose-driven growth company that supports employee development Dick's Sporting Goods is a purpose-driven growth company that is a leader in the sports industry. It is a culture focused on continuous improvement and is comprised of smart and humble teammates. Dick's strives to provide a best-in-class experience for athletes and also supports local communities through sport. These goals make Dick's a fun and rewarding place to work. The company invests in development of its teams and individuals, and has fostered a collaborative way of working across the organization. Growth company, collaborative culture, sports industry, fun, development opportunities Growth company that values humans This is a great company for people who like challenging work, supportive colleagues and a purpose-driven strategy. It is a results-driven company, but not to the extent of sacrificing long-term growth to deliver the short-term numbers. Great place to work A company who stands behind its beliefs. We believe that sports make people better. And work every day to help all athletes play and benefit from sport. Passionate and hardworking people thrive I am proud to tell others that I work for DSG! It is full of wonderful people who care about the company and each other. Working at Dick's Sporting Goods is dynamic, fun, and high energy. The people Striking a consistent work/life balance Love My Job I have worked for Dick's Sporting Goods for nearly 6 years now. What I most love most about our company is the relentless improvement it demands of itself. Every year this company has improved itself in every aspect. The dedication the company has for it's people what really set's us apart. At this point of my life, I could not imagine working for anyone else. Fun and easy Super easy and atmosphere is nice. Management was picky and choosy about the people they were nice to. Other than that it’s easy to get promoted and work your way up in a short period of time. Good for College Students Normal retail job where you will be worked incredible hard and happy to leave each day. Company does not promote from within so don't look at Dick's as a company to stay at long term. Job is most suited for college-age kids looking for some extra money. Turn over is incredible high and work morale is generally very low. The holiday season starts around October and doesn't let up with return season right after. Great Benefits for fulltime workers Poor work culture. Best Company you'll ever work for and best Job you'll ever have! Dick's Sporting Goods cares deeply about its employees (teammates). They clearly recognize this as the greatest asset and go above and beyond when it comes to inclusivity, work-life balance, training, and competitive compensation. The job isn't always easy, but Dick's recognizes that and makes sure every teammate is appreciated and equipped to succeed on the job and in life. Besides having fun at work, I could be any prouder of my company and I think that sentiment is universally transmitted to how we interact with our customers (athletes). 7 Great for hourly, not so much for managers There are a lot of good things about DSG, especially for PT and FT hourly associates. For managers, there is always more that has to be done and nothing is good enough. Work life balance is taught, but non existent. Ever changing daily outside of normal expected tasks Hiring was specific to the Golf Department - with unforeseen expectations to “cover” and upsell other department items and equipment - treadmills, tennis, fitness, with added warranty plans - also expected to be proactive in Dick’s point based signups involving reward cards both credit and store related. Employed part time around 6 years with no relative training to specific golf equipment repairs- only performed by one or two particular employees - after repeated requests and interest to store manager Fun place and Team players I love working at dicks because i love the hours not closing late and I love how everyone is team players at the Brockton location I am very lucky to be working at this location Productive and Fun Workplace Dick’s had a healthy work environment with a lot of teamwork that connected various departments. My time there felt positive and was generally low-stress with friendly teammates. great had a fun time it was a lot of fun we did fun things like have fun and it was a fun job that was a lot fun. would not recommend it. job outlook is good. It’s alright Good place to work, it’s fun just stressful at times when the higher ups don’t listen to what you need in order to be successful. I feel like they only really care about numbers and many stores are struggling with keeping management. Lunches, Good teammates Communication sucks, management not open minded Great start This is a great place to start for customer service jobs. Interactions with all different kinds of people all different age groups. Finding the right fit for each person is a challenge but is very rewarding at the very end Work pleace I love working at disks sporting good the got nice people and good service I meet many people they all nice and cool all the building is clean and nice Great place to work Worked there for over 8 years. Started as PT temporary help. Eventually worked into assistant manager position. Great pay. Great upper management. Business technology was on point and easy to handle. All new employees were treated fairly and well trained. There's always a ton of things to do and your able to help customers and put smiles on their faces Good coworkers but bad scheduling. The coworkers were pleasant and even fun to work with but scheduling was almost always poorly done. Regularly scheduled for closing then opening next morning. Coworkers Management and scheduling It's a Great job until it's not so great Overall I really loved my job as a cashier. It challenged me to adapt quickly to changes and it was a good fit for my social personality interacting with customers. It is hard work but it feels like you've accomplished something at the end of the day. Unfortunately I experienced a very toxic work environment with clear social clicks and drama which hindered us from getting work done. Also management only cares about being #1 metrics wise which created other issues on the floor. free snacks, nice work shirts poor break system, toxic culture Nice job overall The managers are nice and even more once you get to know them. If you do your job, there are no problems. The cool part is you have more freedom in organizing and rearranging clothes than most stores do. The managers try to work with you and your schedule, and are understanding. The management ruins the store I loved my job. I loved the people I worked with. Management just made it a miserable work environment. I watched some of the happiest people in the world, people who could always put a smile on my face, deteriorate over the course of a couple of months. If the store could get a good leadership in position, I believe it could be a fun place to work again. Unfortunately, nothing is being done at this moment. Interesting place to work A good place to work while you are in school. It is not a very glamorous place to work. Usually the same people work the shifts that no one wants to work. A lot of high schoolers work there. Fun place to work Fun place to work if the retail life is for you. The company pushes for equality and diversity with the different awareness topics for different months. Amazing Amazing experience. Had its negatives which are directly influenced by the manager in store. Very progressive in what they do for the employees and customer. Fun work place with the right people Job was quick to learn and fun job at times with your friends. Customers are very easy to deal with and good lunch breaks. Shifts go by quickly and are usually 5-8 hours long. Great place to work This was a great place to work, I really enjoyed working here. I was there for a few years and everybody got along great. I would recommend it to everyone Fair Pay, Low Moral Average warehouse environment. Productivity comes before all else, even safety. Pay is decent. Horrible shiftism. Very understaffed. No accountability from the top down. But consistent work, paid bi-weekly. So so Some people were nice and some people bashed fellow co-workers all day long. Management wasn’t always the nicest either and at times made comments they shouldn’t have. Not a terrible place to work."
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.|" Unrealistic goals, poor planning, poor team culture Management's pie in the sky ambitions combined with poor staff morale and high turnover made this job miserable for many, not just myself. Multiple new products overlapping for product development resources and poor planning for much needed production equipment resulted in engineers working long days, late nights, weekends, holidays far too often. Poor communication across geo-teams. Reporting to too many managers (at least 5). 2 Great culture, management and work/life balance Great culture, management and work/life balance. Passionate and collaborative teams, supportive and helpful. Great pay and benefits. Frequent paid time off. Culture, Management, work/life balance Contract to hire Company has Advance Products and Amazing CEO. Good Technology and new things to learn. Fair base pay but not competitive as per market Beware, No personal growth or WLB or work flexibility or appreciation. Very bad Middle level management. Overall great place to work Downside - extremely fast paced with business need changes given product development - fair that technology is a face changing environment. Great benefits, many days off in addition to vacation and standard holidays. Work from home flexibility and freedom to self pace while aligning with deadlines. Poor management Currently ahead due to intel's mis-steps. Too many people hired from outside with inflated titles. Making the same mistake as we done in the past during the Opteron boom time. Fun Place Good place to work at with lots of opportunity to grow. Lots of people willing to help and give advice. Typical day at work varies a lot but expect to think on your feet. Lot's of learing Good start for a New graduate.People are incredibly good. Takes time to get the full picture of your job. Not good at documentation. Many learning opportunities good start for a New graduate too many meetings every day 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Everything about working for this company was great What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Some employees What is the work environment and culture like at the company? It is great it's a wonderful company to work for What is a typical day like for you at the company? Everyone knows his job and you work alone and at lunch you Communicate with each other Supportive people AMD has very supportive people, people are nice and willing to help. Many new stuffs to learn. Work life balance is good. very flexible and you can work remote or hybrid or at the office Good culture, supportive people, work life balance Low pay compared to other tech companies Worst compensation, poor WLB and bad management Too many meetings in early morning Worst compensation in Bay area poor WLB and bad management They pay new hire with higher salary so lots of well-experienced employee are leaving 'D' in AMD stands for Disorganization There is a clear lack of organization and very poor management. Your everyday schedule is filled with wasteful meetings that could have been avoided with better organization and a few emails. Instead of addressing the fundamental issues, we waste more time in even more meetings looking for band-aid solutions. Routinely multiple teams get assigned with the same task. It is not unusual for a closed task to be redone because no one bothered to check whether it was already completed. And then we have meetings to discuss why we have multiple people doing the same thing. Followed by meetings to follow up on the meeting. And more meetings when it happens again. And again. And again. All the disorganization translate to constant scrambling around trying to meet deadlines, resulting in lacking work quality, which is evident from your first week of working at AMD. Expect to be involved in never-ending fire drills resulting in constant 60+ hour work weeks. There is no overtime pay, and zero appreciation or recognition of you wasting your entire weekend working on yet another fire drill. Connection building Disorganization, no work-life balance, lack of recognition, poor benefits Fast-paced, competitive environment (our biggest competition was Intel) It was a great place to work. I learned a lot about capital equipment and services procurement and about the semiconductor manufacturing industry. Strong, focused leadership. Secure job, poor work life balance, unfair pay and promotion system An old giant organization with rigid process. Bureaucratic every where. You are promoted fast if you are the boss' favourite. If you are not your management's most favorite, they need you to perform 120% to be considered. Promotion system is ridiculous. Only 2 to 3 are promoted every year for a 30-people team. Pay is extremely unfair. I was lowballed when first hire because i needed a job at that time. Never got adjusted. They pay new hire 30% or even 40% more than I currently do. Work life balance not existed in many teams, especially those who are forced to work with geographic distributed teams. Almost every project involves Asian teams. Saying ""no"" to consistent evening calls is considered ""not performing"", not going above and beyond. Job is secure if the company is doing well. Still a choice to work flexible hours, like leaving work early for families/kids Flexibility on remote, depending on your manager Everything mentioned No gut in firing consistently non performing employees Very supportive culture I have worked at AMD for a year now. Everyone is very willing to help and provide support when needed. I feel like the work/life balance is well maintained and is an important aspect of the culture of the company. The onboarding process was easy and the resources and contacts provided to me set me up to quickly and easily learn my role so I could be independent and knowledgeable within the first month. I was assigned an amazing trainer who was very compassionate and made me feel confident and knowledgeable fast within my new role so that I could be independent quickly. Gifts given to team to celebrate wins, great culture and sense of being able to be yourself. None at the moment Stimulating environment, great culture, but some frustrations and crunch. Pros You'll be working with and making meaningful contributions towards getting cutting edge technology into the market. The culture is collaborative and some of your coworkers are leaders in their area. Lots of opportunity to learn and grow while building cool stuff. Cons Schedules can be pretty aggressive, and resourcing tends to be lean. Unfortunately, past crunch or missed deadlines don't always lead to institutional learning for the next project, which can be frustrating. Advice to Management Treat any late-caught issue or schedule near-miss as a planning failure. Invest in unit-level tests as early in development as possible for every features failing late in development. You will save people from getting pulled into emergencies, improve morale, shorten development schedules, and save cost on man-hours to deliver a project. toxic culture at the finance/accounting department long hours and stressful work environment, no work-life balance, toxic culture from the top management (in finance org), high turn over rate, compensation is lower than the market AMD is a cool company, stock is going up no work-life balance, no stock/little bit stocks for finance people Great Place to Work Great experience working at AMD. Diverse work place, management is willing to work with you if you want to move up and advance your career. They take care of their employees. Work environment, diverse. No work life balance The company may be doing good from outside, but employees are taking the hit. Work life balance is non-existent, with majority of the employees working 60 to 80 hours a week, even during the weekend. The management is still unappreciative of the effort and expects the engineers to push harder. Fun workplace with lots of smart people Worked in the Server Validation team in the summer. Everyone is extremely smart and passionate about their work. Not much interaction though due to working remotely during covid. Insurance Plans, Lots of Paid Vacation, Good Pay Not much collaboration A typical hi-tech company The work process is flexible without standardized flow to follow. Senior management doe not help much. Workplace culture is driven by the front line manager. Good work/life balance. Interesting work. Interesting work but pay can be more. There is no lunch. There is table tennis and gym on site. Campus is small and 45 minutes to Boston. Job requirements are satisfying and encouraging. Management is nice and understands employees. No lunch Unrealistic goals, poor planning, poor team culture Management's pie in the sky ambitions combined with poor staff morale and high turnover made this job miserable for many, not just myself. Multiple new products overlapping for product development resources and poor planning for much needed production equipment resulted in engineers working long days, late nights, weekends, holidays far too often. Poor communication across geo-teams. Reporting to too many managers (at least 5). 2 Outdated Processes The company is in a great place from the outside looking in, but employees are often overworked and low morale is rampant. Late night calls happen often and are expected, so work/life balance is non-existent. 1 Productive and fun workplace Good company to work with very supportive and provide good work life balance, quality of work is very good, work from home facilities are provided as well. good place to work Good place to work. A lot of learning opportunities. Hours were flexible. I was just a contractor so I am not eligible for benefits but heard that benefits are good. Terrible culture, Chaotic environemnt, horrible middle management Good: - Base pay above industry average. - Decent benefits - Coworkers are good. Bad: - Management cannot be trusted. - Finger pointing culture. - Status quo cannot be challenged. - Toxic work environment, raised to HR nothing happened. Was told to suck it up and focus on work. - Broken tools, new issues pop up at the moment you least expect. - No processes & structure, fire fighting everyday. - Global Operation is treated as cost center, no manager (including VP & SVP) dare to challenge their counterpart in Business Unit. - Tribal knowledge & silo mentality. Left hand do not talk to right hand. - Poor work life balance, most people work 50~60 hrs every week. Base pay above industry average. Toxic work culture Competent leadership, lots of great learning opportunities, and room to grow. AMD is finally out of the shadows of the other x86 company and leading the industry. It is also doing well in the GPU market. Employees are motivated and among the best in the industry. The compensation could be better, but this is probably true for all non-FAANG companies. Good work-life balance, good quality of work, and still the attitude of a hungry underdog. Quality of work Compensation Great place to learn - Difficult to maintain work-life balance Loved the work and the people at AMD. Lots of opportunity to learn and be challenged. Supportive managers. The volume of work made it difficult to successfully manage work and home life. A management supported balance between what needed to be done and self-directed projects to study It was very common for management to allow for 20% of workhours to go toward self-directed areas of interest. You found something interested and you were encouraged to draft a project plan, including budget, to study that interest, at least as the yield improvement manager for semi-production, that's how I treated my people. Career advancing interests supported It's a factory so many repetitive tasks required to keep the product moving, and to improve the process was always a pressure on time. Work like balance Work life balance is good, career development opportunities , i get to work on while i like and never feel burdened , teammates are always helpful and there is healthy competition Work life balance stock options Highly disorganized This company is always one step ahead of dying There is little guidance and there was zero development There also seems to be little that management does to implement any learning it gets from employees Paycheck Zero culture Beautiful work environment, good work-life balance, so-so senior leadership In general, AMD is a big computer hardware company permeated with an overwhelmingly sense of ""hero worship"" of senior management during my time there. My immediate manager was nurturing and helped me advanced to the next level of my career progression. My coworkers were smart, easy-going and fun people you want to hang out with after work. Advice to senior leadership: Hire great leaders, not good people. Leaders that are forward-looking with great vision, not tunnel vision that don't miss out on opportunities (i.e. tablet industry). Free coffee and tea, fun coworkers, beautiful work environment Over-worship of senior management, tunnel vision of leadership Great place to work Pay is very good and paid time off is very generous. Informal work environment especially with working from home due to covid. But this company is a total market leader. Fast pace and interesting technologies with some caveats AMD has great technology, a lot of smart engineers, interesting area to work in technicality. If that was the entire view of a company, then I would have given it 5 stars. The issues at AMD has more to do with its compensation and reward culture than on the technical front. Management don't hire enough competent engineers who are doing the actual work, instead, they hire ""senior"" members that actually don't do the day to day work. You are not rewarded based on the amount of work you do or the quality of work you do, instead you get rewarded for ""politics"". There are some great engineers but they are often not rewarded for their work vs mediocre senior engineers that don't do anything other than code reviews or filing jira tickets. Work-life balance: Due to lack of management, any issue becomes a priority one issue and you're expected it solve it yesterday. As a result, ""unexpected"" work on weekends happen quite often. It's hard to say about compensation since the stock has gone so well in the past few years but it remains to be seen if AMD will be able to sustain it. But don't expect tier one general compensation. I actually like the CEO, she has saved AMD from the abyss of 2012/2013. The direction and technical work is definitely interesting if you put in the time to learn and in large part is due to her leadership to shift the focus of AMD into areas and beating Intel at the same time. Great and interesting technology. Promotion culture and bad management with engineers. challenging, fast paced work environment worked in the labs for over 20yrs.. the environment is a mix of good+bad. the good: cutting edge equipment and tech. never boring. constant learning curve and opportunities to problem solve. you never know what is waiting for you when you come in the bad: very stressful. poor support and training. did i say stressful? high pressure work environment. everything needed done last month. people and benefits. never boring. too stressful. Great Place to work A typical day as an engineer will be switching between tasks and priorities. Less is more is the philosophy and management makes the employees feel critical in driving AMD goals. Highly invested employees who live and breathe AMD. Co-workers become like family and friends and being understaffed compared to bigger peers, working smart is rewarded. Lots of long hours but never saw anyone complaining as AMDers know how to make work fun. Workplace culture, knowledge base, growth opportunities work-life balance Productive place with ping pong table A typical day at work starts at 830 and ends at 530. Learn to do programming and testing. Culture is decent Hardest part of the job is learning on your own Console Gaming Stressful Good company with not-so-good middle managers AMD in itself is a good company with great products and a great CEO. However, my experience as an engineer was not so great. The main problem lies with middle management. Unfortunately, my manager had no regard or interest in my professional growth -- he wouldn't provide any meaningful feedback on my performance even after multiple requests, no one-on-one meetings, kept me working on the same things for 6 years with no scope of learning anything new even though I kept on requesting, minimal raise and absolutely no recognition. Favoritism and politics are rampant. People are generally nice on the surface, but cold. I felt like a cog in the wheel and ultimately ended up leaving the company (or more correctly, my manager). On the plus side, benefits are good and the pay is okay. The company has been doing well and is under capable leadership. The work environment isn't bad in general and quite often HR would host fun events and stuff. While work-life balance isn't that great, I have had far worse experiences. However, AMD works on cutting edge technology and products, so while there is potentially opportunity to learn new and interesting things, almost all tasks are very partitioned and made limited in their scope. I guess that's kind of the nature of a big and mature company, but chances are that one will probably end up getting assigned a small part of the design and not learn a whole lot. Overall, it's not a bad place to work at, as long as you are lucky enough to get a manager who actually cares. Interesting technology, good benefits, good leadership Bad middle management Nice Everything is great about work.and things go so well and everything get completed on time. This job is seasonal but still goes great. There is lots of people here. We get alone well. More Less money Good company Great team to work with Great products to sell Great technology to develop Super friendly culture Supportive management Good equity value Benefits can be improved Good experience Had fun at my job learned how to use the walkie talkies and learned 10/4 lol it was a good work experience i had to put on my resume the only hardest job was just remember all the codes lol Definitely the workplace culture I enjoyed working with my colleagues and creating special that we could be proud to say we made that. The opportunity to learn and grow with them was an experience i would not trade for anything. Unrealistic goals, poor planning, poor team culture Management's pie in the sky ambitions combined with poor staff morale and high turnover made this job miserable for many, not just myself. Multiple new products overlapping for product development resources and poor planning for much needed production equipment resulted in engineers working long days, late nights, weekends, holidays far too often. Poor communication across geo-teams. Reporting to too many managers (at least 5). 2 Great place to work I loved working at AMD. It’s a great company filled with great people! It takes allot of organization l, communication and time management skills. Things can change and so can your job very quickly so you have to get to know the internal structure and find a place where you fit. Great people, but all are spread way to thin. Work ethic and skills of team members is among the best in the high tech industry. Lots of frustration throughout the organization due to insufficient staffing and resourcing of projects. Dedication to Community Service & Producing Great Products AMD prides itself on a diverse culture and it's commitment to the community and making great products responsibly. I am proud to work for a company lead by an amazing woman and dedicated engineers. It is a team environment and everyone's voices are heard. The company values your input and uses employee feedback to continue to grow and improve. Great opportunities ... and challenging management The company is small when compared to its primary competitors ... therefore, I find that there are many opportunities to take on challenging and fun tasks. However, many of the middle management are focused on maintaining their status rather than driving innovation. Amd Most of the people at AMD are very talented and have desire and willingness to do a great job. The overall culture of management in the company is not ""do it right""...it is ""do it right now"".... Consequently, problems STAY problems...they don't get FIXED, they get 'patched'...time and time and time again... Substantially over worked and understaffed...hopefully, it will change someday....but, it has not changed, yet.... Scrappy culture - underdog competing with giants Lacks consistent corporate culture - your experience varies widely depending on your manager/org. But there are many great people there and they definitely are good at innovating. Great company to work for Spent 7 years with AMD. a roller-coaster for sure but overall a lot of fun and great experiences.. I would recommend anyone to interview and work here. Great place to work due to peers You are given great liberty to do your work as you see best. Great teammates within the SLT realm. Very supportive, respectful, and fun environment. Best places to work I worked as a market research intern and enjoyed everyday till my last day here. My boss was great, she was friendly and guided me properly during my induction phase. Work and office culture is also great. Everything AMD has a fun and relaxing atmosphere and most of all a great work/life balance. Great place to work at. The work/life balance is such a plus and the opportunity to think out of the box and take of the blinders is an awesome touch. smart engineers great place to be around innovative engineering the people are pleasant and communicative exciting technology good leadership relaxing atmosphere good benefits A lethal combination of micromanagement and lack of processes Lack of investment in foundational financial systems leading to manual and inconsistent financial reporting processes that are not repeatable or scalable with growth. No interest in original ideas from outside talent, which leads to micromanagement. That tone is set from the top. Paying low and less diversity of products AMD is paying employee pretty low, and the stock compensation is very low. When I was in AMD, AMD is not doing very well, so the working experience is not very good to me. But, overall, this company is very good at management and motivating people. Gave me a chance at advancement: from Materials Analyst to Business Analyst Very nice staff; I wasn't fond of my job on a daily basis. I would have liked more investigation within the job. I didn't think they paid well when I first started. Was told later you either get the ""Money"" as you come into the company or you don't get it. This was by another employee - may be way off base? Micromanagers, promote isolation Micromanagers, promote isolation, a dont care attitude for the individual. Had to reverse engineer almost everything to come up to speed, and complete goal.. Great place to learn a lot fast. Can be a bit hectic at first, the fast pace will continue even after the understanding settles in. The campus in Austin has a lot of nice features such as gym and cafeteria. Good company Can be stressful depending on who runs the project but all in all a good place to work. Location and campus is overall a nice place. Good benefits and good people. AMD is a great place to learn and work with remarkable engineers AMD has been around a long time and a nearly all innovators in the silicon industry have spent some time at AMD. AMD’s engineering innovation is fantastic, while the company has occasionally suffered with management missteps. Currently the company is doing very well, but Intel is a very hard company to compete against so be realistic about your planning. Very good company to develop and learn from AMD’s long history has produced hard-to-change negative culture in some areas Lots of volatility when I was there. Short staffed and lots of turnover, due to people moving on or due to layoffs and reorganization. I left before it was profitable so I think it's better now. I did like the organization because there were a lot of great people. Good place to work AMD is a good place to work. The company has made an impressive improvement in both, the market (its market share) and advancements in technologies. It is by far one of the most successful stories in the past 3 years. Great work/life balance, lots of freedom, and great compensation No advancement opportunities. Lots of ""politics"". Unrealistic goals, poor planning, poor team culture Management's pie in the sky ambitions combined with poor staff morale and high turnover made this job miserable for many, not just myself. Multiple new products overlapping for product development resources and poor planning for much needed production equipment resulted in engineers working long days, late nights, weekends, holidays far too often. Poor communication across geo-teams. Reporting to too many managers (at least 5). 2 Buddy system has taken over The hiring process within my team was terrible. Candidates have really no idea what position they'll get. We just went by buzz words and gut feeling when deciding to hire somebody or not. To get promoted is all about the politics rather than the work done. 2 Va Not what was expected. Company needs help, superiors are not available, customers are second. Expectation is to lie to the customer in order to make AMD not look bad 2 Inadequate resources This is the place for you if you like a disorganized, spontaneous culture with extremely limited resources. Confirm carefully anything you are told at your interview as they'll tell you anything to get you in the door. exceptional value exceptional work and product line which motivates engineers to work hard and beat the competition. CEO of the company work very hard to turn around the company. They have good ping pang tables They have a good ping pang table. Everyone plays ping pang in Advance Micor Devices. Everyone is a good ping pang player. They are all happy with playping ping pang Great place to make a career Fortune 500 company that has enough room to grow quickly and make a great career. Environment is highly competitive and can be challenging at time but has many opportunities to grow and shine amazing work campus, great teams and basket ball court with gym AMD has an amazing Austin Texas campus equipped with Starbucks, cafeteria, full gym, outdoor basketball courts and parking garage. It has many teams and holds it's own as a Fortune 500 company in the silicone industry many learning opportunities and relocation benefits company is not the top competitor and may continue to downsize Amd AMD is a awesome company. I truly enjoyed working there. My path to this position was earned literally from the ground up. I began selling AMD processors at a distributor with literally no market share and computer experience. I built a very large and dynamic distribution channel network in a very short amount of time. This was easily the most gratifying experience in my professional career. The thing I enjoyed most about this job is that in this position I could use my deep understanding of my customer base to develop and pitch ideas to upper management at AMD. I developed ""program concepts"" that would lead to more revenue in my channel. At AMD I was able to get the audience and interest from product marketing and sales marketing to financially support my concepts. This lead to regional growth from 5 million to 20 million in my three year stint. The culture, management and opportunities to develop at AMD are outstanding. Career Development, Creativity, Accessibilty to top level decisioin makers none Micro Consulting Project workers are smart and work life balance good culture, product is competitive but pay is so so. Good for people that want work life balance. Located in Austin living cost is low work life balance Wok life balance is dependent on role and quarterly goals. If an account is short of goal, rest of organization must make up balance to attain corporate goal. visibility stressful Overall positive experience Working at AMD as a full time intern was one of the most efficient uses of my time. I was able to complete a lot of research and become a leading professional in the field of machine learning. Well paid None Consistently Inconsistant Your overall work-load and career advancement opportunities really depend on what team you are a part of in Global Ops and what your rank is. After being hired at the most entry-level position in the Product Planning group, I was eager to work and take on new tasks, get recognized, and move up quickly. I felt that the first manager I had did not support my ambitions and actually tried to restrict me from taking on more responsibility. After 3 months I had a new manager and she seemed a little more invested in finding opportunities for me to grow, but I have also had 3 different directors in the span of 1.5 years and they have all seemed relatively unconcerned with helping me move up. I am constantly frustrated by the lack of process documentation and standardization across the company which makes the random, urgent requests difficult to accomplish and to measure one's performance against. The days are unpredictable. You could be spending an entire day trying to find productive things to do or you could be bombarded with requests that keep you from doing your daily tasks and then have last minute evening (and morning) calls with the team in Taiwan. Flexible working hours, casual work environment Randomly urgent stressful tasks, lack of recognition/appreciation Since AMD has been in Fort Collins I heard of their job fair in April 2006. I went, (along with many other Intel employees). I was hired right away. Great company, Great CEO! The Fort Collins site has a great company culture. Great team to work with Daily work was always manageable. The work in process was monitored real-time and we were able to schedule our work assignments to meet the production requirements. I learned a great deal about many of the technologies involved in the overall manufacturing process. Co-worker collaboration company is volatile Sales Planning High effort needed - no failure allowed. Must be on point always. If you are a sub performer you will not make it here. Only the best of the best can have a career here. That said, high performers do not react well to fellow co-workers that are dead-weight. great culture if you are the right fit. HIgh performance HIgh performance Great Place to Work Great team to work with. Coworker is collaborated and easy to work with work and personal life balance is good The company is volatile in the market. So employers are affected. Co-worker collaboration company is volatile Great company to work for Typical work day is from 9am to 6pm ...more often after 7pm. Great company to work for. Good management , I learnt to be more confident and goal oriented. Excellent Company Very fast paced. Extremely intelligent employees. Get to work on cutting edge technologies. I recommend this company to anyone looking for a challenge. Good learning experience Very talented and experienced engineers to work with. One can get to work on latest technology. But the downside there is no easy training one has to struggle and fine the right resources to learn and grow. Workplace culture varies from team to team. Hardest part is attrition and management changes so career advancement gets difficult. Great company! Great management! Daily work was always manageable. The work in process was monitored real-time and we were able to schedule our work assignments to meet the production requirements. I learned a great deal about many of the technologies involved in the overall manufacturing process. Unrealistic goals, poor planning, poor team culture Management's pie in the sky ambitions combined with poor staff morale and high turnover made this job miserable for many, not just myself. Multiple new products overlapping for product development resources and poor planning for much needed production equipment resulted in engineers working long days, late nights, weekends, holidays far too often. Poor communication across geo-teams. Reporting to too many managers (at least 5). 2 Management should be more open minded in promoting the current employee i think AMD should be more open minded in internal transfer. There are smart people in the company and people want to improve themselves. The hiring manager should be more open minded. Intense environment AMD was a company that understood its position with Intel and work diligently toward changing that narrative. That effort is reflective in the intense focus on weekly goals. You really have to love the spirit to appreciate the work requested. Great company Was promoted three times in the first two years. Was offered on-site training to improve skills as well as given the opportunity to find my own career-advancement training which was paid for by AMD. Really fun company to work at I was a Co-op Engineer at AMD in Austin. We had a really great group of people, which is pretty relflective of the company at large. At least in my experience, it felt a bit more like I was working at a small company than the second largest manufacturer of computer processors. It was very pleasant and personable. I definitely loved my time there! Great people, personable, exciting, cutting edge Lack of documentation Manufactured I miss working Retirement is the withdrawal from one's position or occupation or from one's active working life. I am may also semi-retire by reducing work hours. An increasing number of individuals are choosing to put off this point of total retirement, by selecting to exist in the emerging state of pre-tirement. Great place to learn... Great place to learn and work on many different things but work-life balance can take a backseat with often aggressive deadlines and sometimes understaffed and overworked teams. i was a contractor and not an employee. my primary focus was sourcing and hiring of quality engineers I was a contractor and focused on my role to recruit. i wasn't an employee. Employees were nice and management took an interest in the hiring efforts. than you. pleasant, management good to work with none in particular Great Employees Deadlines, Deadlines, Deadlines and always behind on them. Company runs on Moore's Law. Too many middle managers, not enough working staff. Company was barely keeping afloat when I was there. I cut my IT teeth there, and learned much from many fellow employees. Free lunch on Product launch days Stressful - fast paced This place rocks If you want to go to a place where almost everyone is very intelligent and driven then work here. If you want to skate through a job then you will be weeded out naturally - the culture is driven and thrives on getting things done - and done right ! Very challenging Lack of upward growth - still too slow to promote the ""smart-kids"" One of the Best Jobs I've ever had I love everything about AMD and would highly recommend it to anyone. The give you the tools and autonomy to grow. AMD has a great corporate culture, even though it has had it's ups and downs. Compensation, People, Culture, Growth, Depth of Career Work/Life Balance, Industry volatility Legacy Systems Need to Improve - Growing fast and focus of management is on right things. Legacy systems need up gradation. - Legacy Systems Need to Improve - Relaxed work culture, low attrition rates. Nice company to work for, but small People love it when AMD is having a run. Today is no different from the 2003 run. Stock shoots up, only to crash few years later. This time? Let's see. Senior AMD Fellow with the opportunity to lead complex projects AMD was probably the most fulfilling from a career advancement perspective. I was the main technical person supporting cross functional teams representing the company at major joint ventures with external partners. As a result My final assignment at AMD was the to establish a Technical Design Center in Dresden, I had the complete responsibility for setting it up, hiring engineers from Eastern Germany initially, then expanded into Europe. I sent Expats to help and coach the engineering teams to handle AMD's design systems. I also had the responsibility of defining the projects which were executed on at the design center. Excellent Company to work for Not any! Great Place to work! AMD is filled with remarkable easy going professionals, has flexible hours and remote options, and embraces work/life balance. If you are looking for a place to land where you can make an impact, the ""scrappy"" Machine Learning, Ai and other groups are amazing! Was better under the control of its founder The company had a purpose while under the control of Jerry Sanders. The company worked as a team and grew. Under later management the commitment to the employees faded. Worked in a fab This workplace is a fast paced wafer fabrication company. They work a compressed shift of 12 hour days. Three days on with three days off & 4 days on with 4 days off. AMD is great but is always chasing Intel Fast paced as new products are always being introduced. I worked in the processor and chipset bring-up side of things. Cube environment with plenty of space. Good place to work Flexible hours. Work at your own pace. Good management. The work place was comfortable. Sometimes the work got a little boring, but for the most part there was always something to do. Wonderfull place to prosper in the local tech scene. I would've stayed with this company forever. But lets be honest the semi conducting industry is always changing. With that said, lay-offs are inevitable. Great Flexibility Overall a great company. Coworkers are great, but there are some bad apples that have negative outlooks and make it hard to work with. Make sure the employees you work with are legit and aren't egocentric."
Sandhills Global, Inc.|" Good WLB. Terrible culture. Will never have to work later than your scheduled hours. However, raises are few and far between. Required to be in office and wear a suit (seriously). Very old school style of running a company. Turnover is high. 4 College Intern I worked at Sandhills Global as a college intern. I was making $15/hr and 20% commission on all sales, which was pretty good money while still being in college. I believe once you are hired the base salary is $40k/year, but that might have changed in the last few years. While I worked there I was required to wear skirts/dresses/tights/ballet flats, which might have been updated since then, but it was awful that it was enforced for so long. I did not feel supported by my managers, when we did monthly reviews they offered no help. They handled COVID-19 poorly in my eyes, we were sent home for a few weeks and then were pressured to return to the office when we were fully capable of doing our jobs at home. Most of the interns in my department were laid off with no notice, including myself. They were extremely intense with micro-managing. One of the biggest perks was they gave out free husker tickets for home games during football season. Nice snack bar/cafeteria, pay, benefits, etc. Dress code, in office requirement, micro-managing 3 Pretty good Pay is flat, expect a high volume call center environment. Managers feel like they barely care most of the time. Open floor seating and very lax on COVID protocols. 1 1 Good place It was an interesting place to work. Lots of things going on. Management didn’t seem to be very supportive. Was overall impressed with work line balance. Great company Great company to work for, family owned and operated. Wonderful with scheduling and time off. Very helpful when training very responsive in management. Highly recommended Flexible Schedule but never able to take vacation without making up the hours. Overall great job, but sometimes you just need a break without worrying about getting in your weekly hours. Flexible Schedule, Generous perks No way to take off ""vacation"" time, without making up your hours I wouldn’t recommend This job is convenient to those who need to work from home but they make you work just under full time hours so they don’t have to pay benefits for you. Poor Poor environment and pay, little support and chance for advancement. Not a lot of training or background on the purpose of job. Unsure of dress code of why you have to wear a suit and tie to sit and enter data at computer all day with no interaction with anyone. Easy work. Plenty Look out for favoritism I recently had to leave Sandhills and all I can say is I'm so happy that I made that decision. Unnecessary write ups, no room for advancement, unless you are the teachers pet. I WORKED HARD at this place for 4 yrs with only ONE raise. You feel like you aren't appreciated. I feel like I wasted 4 yrs of my life there. Our department manager most definitely showed favoritism to a select few of my peers who would mess up alot, even on the most simplistic things. Christmas bonus No room for advancement Gives good experience for individuals just starting out. I would never recommend staying on full-time though. If you’re in college it’s an easy job to have, but I would never recommend staying on full-time. Company culture is a miss and management is questionable. Good place to work in college This is a great place to intern while in college because you get great experience and the pay is fantastic. My career goals took my to a different career path but I would have loved to start here if I wanted to stay in sales/business world. pay, open environment, good management dress code Good internship for college students While it was a stressful job sometimes, Sandhills really does pay well especially for internships for college students. Management however is very strict, but they’re told by the higher ups. If you can sell, they’ll love you. If you’re not the greatest, you won’t succeed. Pay and commission No work/life balance, management Nice Place, jobs have their pro's and cons I really enjoy working here. It is low stress, managers are supportive and I've learned a good amount since I started here. The only problem is their offices which are extremely nice are not conducive for a productive team environment. You don't really need a team though since typically all work is done by yourself and you get a few projects here or there with someone else. I went a week without having a reason to speak to anyone face to face Easy, supportive managers Really easy to be complacent, not a lot of room for advancement Good place to put on a resume but not work at long term Constant change of priorities leave sales teams in limbo as to what squeaky wheel gets the grease this week. CEO operates with a sense of entitlement and comes across as arrogant and unapproachable to most employees outside of his circle. Constant turnover along with long time employees leaving causes morale issues. It’s a great place to start out career wise but set your sights higher long term. Free Huskers Football tickets for employees Outdated dress code, micromanagement Worst company I have ever worked for When I accepted the job at Sandhills I was extremely excited to start. It did not take long for me to realize that this was not a great company to work for. They promote their open floor plan as a positive thing, so that you can get to know your coworkers better, but really it is so managers can look over your shoulder at anytime to see what you are doing. They have a task order system, in which EVERYTHING gets sent to your manager for review before you can complete any task. Even asking for office supplies has to be approved by a manager before you can receive it. Honestly the environment is just miserable. When you work for a company 5 days a week, 40 hours a week, you want to feel comfortable. This is NOT the case at Sandhills. I can in with a few years of experience and thought I was pretty good at my job, but after working for Sandhills for a year, I had never felt more incompetent in my ability to do my job. It was until I left sandhills and started working for my current company that I finally felt like I had a voice, and knew what I was doing. The dress code sucks, but it is honestly the least of your worries there. Managers will NEVER come up and talk to you straight to your face, instead they just send you an extremely passive email. Honestly, I would not recommend this company to my worst enemy. No one should ever have to go through what this company puts you through. They decide within the first week if they are going to like you or not, and if they don't, LOOK out, because you are in for a rough experience. You will never have to worry about getting fired, They won't terminate you, because they are so scared they will get sued, but they will make your work life so awful that you will have no other option but to leave. Good company to work for. Pay was decent benefits were not the best though. Lots of different areas of company to work in. Work-life balance Work life ba Pay & benefits The pay at Sandhills Global was good but the benefits were bad insurance was high and no company match. Alright place to work they have some good things like good pay and give you the ability to work hard and make some money. Have some good training for new people coming into sales as well. N/a - No cubical, big open “desk” seating. - Lots of perks: community and benefits - Compensation. - Work/ balance. - Really no room for advancement. - Numbers business, that’s weird for designers. Good Product, Bad management The best thing I can say for Sandhills is their line of products. They offer a wide variety and are effective in the industry, making it a good product to sell. You generally leave right at 5:00 as well, outside of travel, making work life balance a positive at Sandhills. The negatives mostly stem from upper management, specifically the CEO. Unprofessional and often threatening emails are regularly sent company wide calling out individual performances. Negative reinforcement is common and positive reinforcement is rare and usually inorganic. This is also usually the only method of letting you know if you're doing well or not at the company, as proper reviews and expectations are not given at Sandhills. Middle Management are generally easy to work with, though not without fault as well. There is a lack of communication between middle management and their departments as well as a lack of set expectations. As mentioned above, there are no monthly or quarterly reviews and yearly reviews usually involve only a cursory glance of the past year and vague plans for the next FY with no fiscal goals set. Compensation is varied depending on which department and territory you work. Average compensation is acceptable for entry level sales. However there is no 401K match and vacation is minimal. The company does (usually) give out a nice Christmas bonus to all employees, but no bonuses based on sales. In summation, I would say it weren't for the CEO then the company would be a pleasant place to work. If you're just starting out in sales this can be a positive step in that direction. Worklife balance, Products No 401K Match, Poor upper management Strict and Stressful Environment The environment is very formal. There is not a lot of collaboration with other members. Training is an informational overload and it was hard to get answers to questions. Job that pays well with room for advancement Managers don't seem to look out for your best interest. Their motivation is to embarrass employees rather than reward good deeds. Culture is terrible. Good WLB. Terrible culture. Will never have to work later than your scheduled hours. However, raises are few and far between. Required to be in office and wear a suit (seriously). Very old school style of running a company. Turnover is high. 4 Decent work environment Sandhills does not offer any job advancement, however, for steady pay it's a decent job. You dont make enough for the cost of living but you get 401k, some health, dental, and vision. 2 Constantly growing company I enjoy my position and what I do. Workload isn’t overwhelming but can be stressful at times. My biggest complaint there is no feedback on job performance for new employees, and no set time frame for raises or work evaluations to let employees know if they are meeting expectations. There is no stated probation period. Most co-workers are friendly. The dress code is professional; suites, white shirts and tie, dresses and pantyhose. Flexible hrs Long periods of sitting Fun productive place Great place to work. Very easy going in our department. Liked the professionalism of the office and its employees, but still able to have fun. Good, supportive supervisors who want you to succeed. Professional environment, good boss and co-workers If you don't like business professional, you won't like it there Not a great place to work For the most part, days give the appearance of autonomy, but they're not that great. Often put on ""projects"" to generate ""leads"" that are never contacted by the sales team. No incentives to perform in the office. Sales team treated like Gods, marketing team treated like hobos. Management only cares about results, not the people creating the results. Slim to none when it comes to career advancement opportunities. ONLY positive about the job is the annual bonus based on number of days you travel, and that you occasionally get to travel somewhere interesting. Annual Bonus Poor management, boring work, treated like an object. Not a place you want to work If you like being treated like garbage and talked down to, this is the place for you. If you like call campaigns to try and make sales for products you don't receive commission on, this is the place for you Awesome place to work for I worked with Sandhills for one year and a half. My manager was great and my peers were very helpful. They care about their people and their development. Mercadotecnia Una empresa que está en alto crecimiento, excelente personas. Management was poor Management didn't have a clue on day to day functions of my role. Lack of advancement unless you were part of the inside group. Suit and tie everyday is outdated and not necessary to do your job effectively. Productive and open environment Nice place to start out, capable of expanding knowledge incredibly within short time. Great management, great employees/coworkers. Stress-free environment. formal business setting management can be over barring. Have to wear a white long sleeve dress shirt and suit and tie every day. nice place to work if you just do your job and don't ruffle feathers of middle management nice pay middle management Growing Business The campus is massive with a lot of new buildings being built every year it seams. Very formal work place with a lot of attention to detail in every division of the company Good place to work, would recommend Sandhills has been a great company to work for over the years. Would highly recommend to apply there. There is a large earning potential and you get to work with great customers in sales. I have enjoyed my time here. It is competitive, and fast paced, but that keeps me motivated. Strong company to work for and develop your skills. Great company, old school culture, but the pay is great, and the managers are even better. They work very hard for you to succeed. Prepare to travel frequently. Excellent company to build connections. Growing very fast, and is the #1 company in the industry; which is big for sales. Management and pay Only 10 days vacation every year for your first 3 years. great place This is an ever growing and great company to work for! If you love to travel this is the job for you! This company is at the top of the industry and will help you succeed. Best Sales Internship Ever Can honestly say Sandhills Publishing offers the best internship possible for a college student. The internship has a great hourly wage with uncapped commission potential, and gives intern the experience needed to do anything they want upon graduation. Interns set their own schedule, are given a tablet and iPhone, and have the opportunity to make $40-$50 an hour consistently. Interns just moved into a brand new state-of-the-art building, and upon graduation always have the ability to open the conversation into full-time opportunities. Intern management can feel very micro-managed (I've received the same email 5 times within an hour from different levels of management), and if they want their hand in on what you are doing, they definitely will. Strict white shirt & tie dress code, no exceptions. Very hard focus on the bottom line. Opportunity for travel even as a student. Culture is the part to be most improved on...often the feel is full-time reps and even interns dislike their jobs and are only their for money. Great opportunity to make as much money as you want, without having to call and sell to people in your private life (like Northwestern Mutual). Overall, extremely great internship and can't be thankful enough for finding it. Friendly work place not too difficult Work from 7-4 every day of the week. Not expected to work more or less.Work place is fine, not too much pressure as a developer to get stuff done. Management is fine, they understand you have school. Hardest part is learning the code base. The culture is decent people are friendly and easy to get along with. Review Fast paced. Great people. Just don't agree with everything that goes on there. Lots of travel which was good for me. Not enough room for advancement. Waiting for someone to quit to advance. Terrible Culture Good job experience when you first get out of college but do NOT stick around, no opportunity for growth and terrible workplace culture. Managers are arrogant and ignorant. Sandhills Publishing Typical day at work will involve sales calls, work trips, and meetings throughout the week. Very rewarding career if your sales oriented. Sky is also the limit for compensation. Very rewarding company if you want to work hard. Solid employer to build experience in sales as an intern. They have a good intern program where they show you several facets of the business and train you to be an effective sales rep. The pay is generous for a college student but bureaucracy and favoritism prevent advancement. Good WLB. Terrible culture. Will never have to work later than your scheduled hours. However, raises are few and far between. Required to be in office and wear a suit (seriously). Very old school style of running a company. Turnover is high. 4 Growth Opportunities and Professional Culture I sincerely appreciate the professionalism of the company and the work mentality. At Sandhills I have opportunities to prove myself through the work that I do on a daily basis and know that I can continue to grow as a professional. The fast paced environment gives you the opportunity to learn in an exciting environment that evolves within the industries you work in. I definitely recommend to those who are looking to progress and find a competitive, well paid, professional environment. Competitive Pay, Professional Environment, Opportunities for growth, Benefits 7 10 Productive workplace with some amazing coworkers You learn alot in this very open workplace environment. The people made the job and the environment fun and exciting. Depending on the manager, the management was relaxed enough to give you space. Some managers liked to micromanage constantly, making the job seem more tedious. vacation days as soon as you start no 401k 17 2 Good Product/Bad Management They have developed a great product but their management is terrible. They never listen to any of their employees when feedback is provided. When you do try and provide feedback they label you a complainer. Listed to your employees to avoid losing some great talent like you constantly are. Great co-workers bad management, very outdated policies Good first job, but don't stay here This is a good place to work right after college. The pay is good but the benefits are mediocre. Company is run in an old fashioned way. Management is incompetent, especially at the Scottsdale office. good pay everything else It is what you make of it Make yourself a list of what's important to you and your job. If that list contains; -Great compensation -Developing you as a professional -Employee travel ...then Sandhills is the play for you. If your list looks more like; -Unlimited time off -Friendly work environment -A company that appreciates you ....then keep on looking. Compensation, travel, company phone Culture, Management Good place to work as developer The people who work at Sandhills are good people to work with and they treat you fair. The work isn't bad. Wearing suits is the biggest downfall. The culture isn't great compared to most software companies. Good Pay, Free Lunches Upper management not always on same page Healthy earning workplace As I'm sure it has already been stated, Sandhills is known for compensating their employees as well as anyone in Lincoln. There is a tremendous amount of opportunity for advancement for the hardworking, success driven employees. Hard to find a better opportunity in the area. Rewarding pay Rigid enviroment Stressful working environment with little leadership but high rewards Travelled 60-70 days a year visiting current customers and locating new leads. Working with both print and web medium. Management provides little guidance besides negative reinforcement. The hardest part is the initial sale, after that it was good repeat business. It was also very difficult to get payment from customers and if they went bad debt that comes out of my pocket. Potential high pay High stress and travel Good pay Got to travel a lot to meet with clients. Nice that they give you an iphone, ipad and a laptop as well. Its nice to work with other departments as well. Corporate feel with laid back atmosphere The dress code seems unreasonable but I really enjoyed working with the coworkers and managers in my department. Owner goes out of his way to take care of his employees. Free popcorn, magazines you won't have interest in... Can't roll up sleeves not a fun place to work You learn very much in the beginning but it is not a fun working environment and management is not friendly. It is a family run business that favours family members and the culture is to make money. The pay is decent but the work balance is awful learning experience, traveling, husker tickets, and food give aways for christmas benefits are bad, hollidays are non existant, managers are not friendly, family members are benefited over other employees Great Internship Experience Flexible hours and good experience. Work with a variety of customers on a day to day basis. Great opportunity to get a foot in the door with sales. Sales Sold advertising to aircraft dealers and brokers for Controller, Executive Controller and Charter Hub publications and websites. - Designed display advertising - Handled online advertising - Advertiser website development - Prospected for new business - Developed new sales strategies - Traveled monthly to visit clients - Attended industry trade shows and events Little Benefits No room for advancement, bad benefits, travel all the time. Coworkers are the best part, play favorites, get a phone, open work environment, little supervision Sandhills Publishing Good local company. Limited opportunities when I worked there. Account Executive Overall ok place to work 25-30 overnight travel good pay below average work/life balance Fun, laid back work environment. Employees are treated good by management and the compensation is fair. One of the better paying places for editorial in Nebraska. The benefits have improved since I was there. For example, first year used to be no paid vacation, but I believe you get at least one week paid when you start. If it's the first place you've ever worked, then you may not be missing anything, but for women there's a very formal dress code and for men it's suit and tie daily--even if you never see a customer. Features a wide variety of jobs and some good opportunity to make a very comfortable wage, but that also may require some patience. You need to be okay with being given direction while not being able to provide as much feedback as you'd like. Left on good terms, but cannot imagine going back to work there again. close to lincoln airport and i-80. no room for feedback, can be draconian. Good WLB. Terrible culture.

My career goals took my to a different career path but I would have loved to start here if I wanted to stay in sales/business world. pay, open environment, good management dress code Good internship for college students While it was a stressful job sometimes, Sandhills really does pay well especially for internships for college students. Management however is very strict, but they’re told by the higher ups. If you can sell, they’ll love you. If you’re not the greatest, you won’t succeed. Pay and commission No work/life balance, management Nice Place, jobs have their pro's and cons I really enjoy working here. It is low stress, managers are supportive and I've learned a good amount since I started here. The only problem is their offices which are extremely nice are not conducive for a productive team environment. You don't really need a team though since typically all work is done by yourself and you get a few projects here or there with someone else. I went a week without having a reason to speak to anyone face to face Easy, supportive managers Really easy to be complacent, not a lot of room for advancement Good place to put on a resume but not work at long term Constant change of priorities leave sales teams in limbo as to what squeaky wheel gets the grease this week. CEO operates with a sense of entitlement and comes across as arrogant and unapproachable to most employees outside of his circle. Constant turnover along with long time employees leaving causes morale issues. It’s a great place to start out career wise but set your sights higher long term. Free Huskers Football tickets for employees Outdated dress code, micromanagement Worst company I have ever worked for When I accepted the job at Sandhills I was extremely excited to start. It did not take long for me to realize that this was not a great company to work for. They promote their open floor plan as a positive thing, so that you can get to know your coworkers better, but really it is so managers can look over your shoulder at anytime to see what you are doing. They have a task order system, in which EVERYTHING gets sent to your manager for review before you can complete any task. Even asking for office supplies has to be approved by a manager before you can receive it. Honestly the environment is just miserable. When you work for a company 5 days a week, 40 hours a week, you want to feel comfortable. This is NOT the case at Sandhills. I can in with a few years of experience and thought I was pretty good at my job, but after working for Sandhills for a year, I had never felt more incompetent in my ability to do my job. It was until I left sandhills and started working for my current company that I finally felt like I had a voice, and knew what I was doing. The dress code sucks, but it is honestly the least of your worries there. Managers will NEVER come up and talk to you straight to your face, instead they just send you an extremely passive email. Honestly, I would not recommend this company to my worst enemy. No one should ever have to go through what this company puts you through. They decide within the first week if they are going to like you or not, and if they don't, LOOK out, because you are in for a rough experience. You will never have to worry about getting fired, They won't terminate you, because they are so scared they will get sued, but they will make your work life so awful that you will have no other option but to leave. Good company to work for. Pay was decent benefits were not the best though. Lots of different areas of company to work in. Work-life balance Work life ba Pay & benefits The pay at Sandhills Global was good but the benefits were bad insurance was high and no company match. Alright place to work they have some good things like good pay and give you the ability to work hard and make some money. Have some good training for new people coming into sales as well. N/a - No cubical, big open “desk” seating. - Lots of perks: community and benefits - Compensation. - Work/ balance. - Really no room for advancement. - Numbers business, that’s weird for designers. Good Product, Bad management The best thing I can say for Sandhills is their line of products. They offer a wide variety and are effective in the industry, making it a good product to sell. You generally leave right at 5:00 as well, outside of travel, making work life balance a positive at Sandhills. The negatives mostly stem from upper management, specifically the CEO. Unprofessional and often threatening emails are regularly sent company wide calling out individual performances. Negative reinforcement is common and positive reinforcement is rare and usually inorganic. This is also usually the only method of letting you know if you're doing well or not at the company, as proper reviews and expectations are not given at Sandhills. Middle Management are generally easy to work with, though not without fault as well. There is a lack of communication between middle management and their departments as well as a lack of set expectations. As mentioned above, there are no monthly or quarterly reviews and yearly reviews usually involve only a cursory glance of the past year and vague plans for the next FY with no fiscal goals set. Compensation is varied depending on which department and territory you work. Average compensation is acceptable for entry level sales. However there is no 401K match and vacation is minimal. The company does (usually) give out a nice Christmas bonus to all employees, but no bonuses based on sales. In summation, I would say it weren't for the CEO then the company would be a pleasant place to work. If you're just starting out in sales this can be a positive step in that direction. Worklife balance, Products No 401K Match, Poor upper management Strict and Stressful Environment The environment is very formal. There is not a lot of collaboration with other members. Training is an informational overload and it was hard to get answers to questions. Job that pays well with room for advancement Managers don't seem to look out for your best interest. Their motivation is to embarrass employees rather than reward good deeds. Culture is terrible."
MagnaFlow|" Trust? Trust? A typical day at work Stretch deal with constant competition. What you learned When you have a talent it's your job make sure it is being utilized. Management ""Team"" can be a good thing and a bad thing. Workplace culture The brand name is dependent upon caring individuals that care about each other and the product or changes need to be made. The hardest part of the job Getting any advancement The most enjoyable part of the job Great employees 1 It was a okay place, management on the talk to favorites. Pay was low In order to work here you have to be a diehard car guy and that’s about it, pay was low, management play favorites and only talk to certain people. They did buy lunch about once a month. Mostly robot type work. Usually free lunch about once a month. Management played favorites, only talk to the people they liked and on the advanced the people they liked. Ok place It was a decent place management could be more understanding of things. It’s a cool place to get discounts for car gear and the coworkers are chill but management can be a pain to deal with about things. Free lunches free gear paid uniforms Look good at first This place only has one way system. Your opinion mostly don't count. The leave system here sucks because you have to be at least 2 years before you can really your stead. The pay is somewhat multiplied by the common core way to where it's not a fair way of doing a payout, they do give you lot of goodies and bonus on December yearly Lastly, if you want to be promoted to where up the ladder, you best have a good college degree, but then when you find out the work system later, you will definitely leave for good. Many good people left because of the one way management system operated. Free food monthly, company picnics Favoritism Decent Job Overall a good company. Pay could have been better considering the heavy equipment being used. Pay raises were given based on how many pieces of equipment you were trained on. However, this only amounted to a few cents. 40 hour work week, voluntary overtime Pay Lots of opportunity with a focus on workplace culture Awesome place to be. No company is perfect, but you can really sense that management is invested in both the people that work here and the products that we are producing. I appreciate the open encouragement of finding paths to grow within the organization. Birthday holiday, generous company events, nice coworkers, really nice facility Such a large organization, it can be hard to connect on a personal level with everyone Management only worried about certain customers. Magnaflow purchased our company and thought they can do a much better job than how we were doing it, They were only interested in one major player and we all had to suffer. Mostly every sale that was made to this company we lost money. All our old time customers started leaving us and going to out competitors. Magnaflow said nothing would change, three years later everyone lost their jobs. Be very careful if you work for them. None Everything about this company Destination Organization for both Seasoned Professionals and New Resources alike A typical day at work: - Loads of cross-functional synergy, come in, interact, crosspollinate, and collaborate with a large group of other passionate and capable professionals. What I learned: - It does exist! A place that puts as much back into its employees, as its employees put into into it. Management: - Highly Skilled and hungry for communication and connectivity. Workplace culture: - Family vibes, more than employees, feel's like you're a part of something much larger. The hardest part of the job: - Pacing, so much growth and evolution to keep pace with financial success, that it's easy to get a head of yourself and think more time has passed than actually did. The most enjoyable part of the job: - Interacting with my fellow teammates, both up and down the org-chart, everyone brings so much energy to their role, that it makes even the most mundane tasks feel like a triumph due to the combination of speed, scale, and efficiencies. Opportunity Rich, Competitive Salary, Lovely Culture I didn't start here sooner Nothing good Do not waste your time There’s nothing really positive about working here. You Are treated as if you are a robot that does not require brakes or any lunch unless you are a manager. They count leaving and walking to to take a break as a break. There is only one entrance to the building so you’re screwed on time. Company held many fun events as well as company picnics and prizes Overall the company was a great place to work for I had many good employees and we all got around great.There was opportunity to grow but with a limit but they also had prizes and great benefits and payed weekly Fun events Had to use PTO for everything really hard to accumulate PTO Nice and clean working environment Very well ventilated and clean spacious shop space if they ever look at this I hope they would hire me back. I left because of some workplace drama. The schedule is great Work Place Culture everyone here loves to sport and promote the brand, i'd say that makes them proud to be an employee... there is always an attempt to make the workplace a more desirable place to work and not make it feel like a sweatshop Decent job Magnaflow is a good place for benefits and decent pay depending on what department you're in. Management is okay your supervisors will not listen to any ideas you have to make a smoother operation. Moving up in this company is pretty difficult unless you are Mexican and friends with the supervisors. Great culture Employees working together to achieve common goals. Good communication. Great teamwork. There is a strong sense of pride and brand loyalty. Keep doing what works! Facilities/ Janitorial ● Work-life balance Magnaflow takes the health and well being of it’s employees seriously. They strive to make the workplace as safe as possible even if there was no pandemic. ● Pay & benefits Comparable to other manufacturing companies, Magnaflow has good benefits. ● Job security and advancement Attendance, performance and attitude is a must if you want to advance in this company. ● Management The management teams are very knowledgeable in their positions and are always ready to help any employee to achieve success. ● Culture The culture is friendly.

Even though I have been laid off, I appreciate the job that I have been given. Amazing group of professionals The entire staff is working towards the same goal of perfection enthusiastically. Everyone is always willing to help. I look forward to contributing to the common good of this amazing brand. Innovative and caring company Nice family company that is also able to operate as a professional corporation. Great company that ensures a sound financial future for the sake of its employees. Productive and fun place to work Great place to work. Always felt a sense of belonging. The company takes care of their employees. Management always listened and took into consideration my concerns. en ambiente de trabajo y bonos Los jefes muy atentos y preocupados por sus empleados excellent brand, great potential great company to work for, aggressive growth and attractive expansion projects, great customers. Fun environment and now with an excellent safety record and culture excellent every day of work was diferente i learned that cleaner the place is more safe the management was really strong really good because all work as a team i do not have a hard day of work i think because i know how to execute my job and i enjoy most enjoyable part is every day is totally diferente Trust? Trust? A typical day at work Stretch deal with constant competition. What you learned When you have a talent it's your job make sure it is being utilized. Management ""Team"" can be a good thing and a bad thing. Workplace culture The brand name is dependent upon caring individuals that care about each other and the product or changes need to be made. The hardest part of the job Getting any advancement The most enjoyable part of the job Great employees 1 Not good pay Had training but no review or added pay. They have events but have to get back to work fast. Management is not good. Lots of favoritism. I didn't want to work there long 1 Learned alot It is a great place to work at. It is a clean environment, everyone listens and helps when there is a problem. At this time there is just not a moment to grow in the business. 1 Good place to learn The company is great and treat there employees nice, just when it comes to annual raises they aren't forthcoming even if you develop skills and the knowledge. This is the place you can learn a variety of skills in manufacturing. Discount on parts and help with school Short breaks, with long hours and Mandatory saturdays Awful Management Every roll on the production floor is repetitive, dangerous, and machines are poorly maintained. Had employees leave saws running unattended. They only had 2 people to do the maintenance of all the machines in the warehouse, and as a result, many of the machines should not have been in use. Sometimes see cool cars Management, safety hazards Unsafe work environment No safety procedure in place for electrical . It’s Mickey Mouse lock out tag out and isn’t legal . No training , no procedure no records . It’s a free for all Magnaflow Great place to work if you are an illegal. Company don't care about its employees just get the numbers no quality. Half the stuff made in china opened up a facility in Mexico and layed off over half of the welders at the Oceanside facility. Not a good place to work. horrible Stay away from this horrible place, management from the very top down sucks. Worst place I have ever worked amd their exhaust are actually being welded and assembled iin Mexico and their motorcycle exhaust is garbage and not even made by them anymore it is all out sourced. they treat their employees like they are disposible and racsim runs through there like the Nile its ok its ok but i need to find a better place to start my career. They pay weekly so that's good i guess. Also the benefits are good. You have to work fast or they'll fire you pay weekly short breaks Stressful, over the shoulder apprehensions A company where a small inside group ""rules"" and if you are not on the inside of this elite group, your job security is nonexistent. Most employees are not on the ""inside"" and thus everyone is fearful of their jobs making this a highly stressful situation and wears you out until you find a way to exit the company on your own. Great Company Magnaflow is a great company for anyone that wants to get into the Automotive Aftermarket Industry. The company is family owned. Company has class and is family friendly. Family Atmosphere;Great Benefits Not a great company for advancement.High stress levels good place to learn new skills This is not a place to be if you are not a ""yes man"". If you are a soldier willing to march into the line of fire (consistently due to poor management decision making at all levels) then you will be ok. Some exceptional people currently remain in the organization but the company is unable to retain talent for long due to poor pay and management style. Ambiente de trabajo poco agradable, en malas condiciones y mas que nada con encargados sin vocación. Necesitan ver más por el empleado y no por sus intereses. Necesitan ser una compañía mucho más estable con sus horarios. Necesitan poner líderes y supervisores con vocación y con ganas de alludar y no con ganas de exprimir a la gente. Tiene seguro medico, seguro dental, seguro de vida y hay eventos durante el año. Es una compañía manejada por gente inepta. MY experience with Magnaflow. My feelings towards this companies actions are bitter to say the least. I feel that the management takes little to no consideration of how its workers feel. Safety they said was their main concern, however, they didn't provide a dust mask for me to wear. Don't work here. free food poor safety You're working for peanuts They start you off with very little pay. they tell you that you'll get a review after your 90 days. However that has not been the case that I have seen. every Monday they come in with a new group of people that will start working there. Iv only seen 3 people get the review on time only one decided to stay. your raise depends on the amount of points you receive on each machine or task you are doing the highest points available are 5 Points for one machine. 1 point is worth $0.03 you get the points after completing three months of operating the machinery. However that's just for when you start. After that its yearly reviews. almost a quarter of employees quit last year due to $0.01 raises. this company treats everyone like monkeys they expect you to slave away and over exert yourself. by far the worst company I've ever worked for. Lunch truck Everything It was a very good experience to work for this company Typical I made one or two new fixture every two days, and the fixtures are not made the same, avery fixture is different. Every fixture has to accomplish the company standards, so that the fixture can be used for production employees in production department, and being able to produce more, as long the fixture is made the right way. That is a challenge that I enjoy the most in my job. The most difficult part of my job now is, the management. In my experience, when they are doing a good job, that reflect in the final product, which is our product, fixtures, good fixtures. But now we are having some problems, in my opinion for the wrong management. I sure left this company 2 years ago. Thank you. great work place I've learned many things from Magnaflow as an employee and as a person, they taught me many skills that i will be able to carry on to a new job Was great at first Family run company, lots of family employed there too so family (and friends of family) politics as well as office politics. hardest part of the job were the politics enjoyable part of the job are your co workers. They managed to hire some really great people with big hearts. free lunches, special off site gatherings paid for by the company management, politics nice place to work for they cared about their employees fast paced get it done attitudes I learned new things every day free lunches every now and then healthcare pick nicks etc. long hrs short breaks Fun and Exciting Company, but with Management issues Typical Manufacturing plant. The job was great the first 2 years and then it went downhill when new management was brought in. The workers and everyone in the office was wonderful. Company had lavish Christmas Parties and held quarterly catered lunches for the employees. The family that own the company are wonderful people but they hired some bad apples. Without a real HR department there was a lot of favoritism and the work atmosphere was abusive at times. very friendly workers, nice corporate functions, family owned poor management choices, abusive atmosphere Trust? Trust? A typical day at work Stretch deal with constant competition. What you learned When you have a talent it's your job make sure it is being utilized.

Atlassian| Productive and collaborative company. Great company to work for. Employees are talented and valued. This shows in productivity, benefits and pay. Sometimes hiring process is long and slow. Be patient. It's worth it. 1 Ups and downs I learned a lot here. Overall, it was more positive than negative. But, I was happy to move on. I found something closer to my sense of purpose and aligned with my personal likes. Wlb Work is work It’s a paycheck. Everyone cares about what they do which gives us a sense of camaraderie but they don’t pay as well as the competition and raises are few and far between. Good culture though. Benefits Work life balance 1 Good company for full time employees I was a contract employee, so I can't say much about the benefits here. Although from heresy it's pretty great. It has gotten more bureaucratic as time has gone on, but the cofounders try to listen to their employees. My favorite part of the company is how they try to stick to their values. Lots of benefits from working in the office. Middle-management seems confused Great company to work at if you are full time If you are a full time employee, you will enjoy working here. Full time employees get great benefits and the company works hard to foster a sense of community. The founders seem to care about their employees. But in my experience, contractors are seen differently and my impression when I left is that they're going to divide that line further. Company sticks to their values, free meals and snacks, good work and life balance, professional coworkers I am under the impression middle management runs around like chickens with their heads cut off Best recruiters I've worked with The recruiting team was full of rockstars. I learned a lot from every one of them. Team first atmosphere but the customer was the focus. Very good interview process. Great place to work I worked as a contractor for close to a year at Atlassian and had a great experience getting to know the team as well as the organization. I would absolutely work there again and it has inspired to pursue a full-time position after working freelance for close to 5 years as a product designer. Stepping Stone Job This is a place that essentially sells dreams with unrealistic quotas and unachievable OTE. The people make it fun to work there but management is out of touch and don't care about the individual lives of the SDRs. Coming in early and staying late is praised, giving a terrible work life balance for most people. Good place to intern Somewhat slow for an intern, but that's to be expected. Good manager and perks. Good team, great people to work with. Amazing office. Free meals during the day. great culture Great office environment. Lunches are catered on Fridays and there are occasional happy hours. The reps conduct their own demos and the company has a quality product. Great They paid me and I had free food and central air and a roof above my head. The people were not aliens or robots and they did not hurt me physically, mentally, or spiritually. You will not be rich but you will be ok. best work environment Best place to work - games, free food etc.. You will get whatever you want to increase the productivity. associates are relaxed and chill type both in and outside the work. Na Its great. A lot of churn thru the company as of now. Not sure how my fture is in the company. Hopefully the company will continue to develop new technologies and better tools Good benefits, terrible management Management does not respect engineering decisions and pushes their own political agenda. There is no accountability or ownership of anything, and when management says that there will be accountability what they mean is that engineers should be accountable for broken solutions forced on them by management. Management makes drastic and terrible decisions, and then claims everything is fine even though a large portion of engineers are angry about it and multiple have quit or transfered to other teams over it. Free lunches Healthcare doesn't cover anything, management is terrible Rapidly growing software company with a unique culture A highly collaborative environment that is growing headcount and revenues rapidly over the past several years.

Company sticks to their values, free meals and snacks, good work and life balance, professional coworkers I am under the impression middle management runs around like chickens with their heads cut off Best recruiters I've worked with The recruiting team was full of rockstars. I learned a lot from every one of them. Team first atmosphere but the customer was the focus. Very good interview process. Great place to work I worked as a contractor for close to a year at Atlassian and had a great experience getting to know the team as well as the organization. I would absolutely work there again and it has inspired to pursue a full-time position after working freelance for close to 5 years as a product designer. Stepping Stone Job This is a place that essentially sells dreams with unrealistic quotas and unachievable OTE. The people make it fun to work there but management is out of touch and don't care about the individual lives of the SDRs. Coming in early and staying late is praised, giving a terrible work life balance for most people. Good place to intern Somewhat slow for an intern, but that's to be expected. Good manager and perks. Good team, great people to work with. Amazing office. Free meals during the day. great culture Great office environment. Lunches are catered on Fridays and there are occasional happy hours. The reps conduct their own demos and the company has a quality product. Great They paid me and I had free food and central air and a roof above my head. The people were not aliens or robots and they did not hurt me physically, mentally, or spiritually. You will not be rich but you will be ok. best work environment Best place to work - games, free food etc.. You will get whatever you want to increase the productivity. associates are relaxed and chill type both in and outside the work. Na Its great. A lot of churn thru the company as of now. Not sure how my fture is in the company. Hopefully the company will continue to develop new technologies and better tools Good benefits, terrible management Management does not respect engineering decisions and pushes their own political agenda. There is no accountability or ownership of anything, and when management says that there will be accountability what they mean is that engineers should be accountable for broken solutions forced on them by management. Management makes drastic and terrible decisions, and then claims everything is fine even though a large portion of engineers are angry about it and multiple have quit or transfered to other teams over it. Free lunches Healthcare doesn't cover anything, management is terrible Rapidly growing software company with a unique culture A highly collaborative environment that is growing headcount and revenues rapidly over the past several years. The Talent team successfully balanced helping the company scale while implementing process & HRIS changes to support the tech-savvy workforce. Great culture Atlassian was a great place to experience my internship. I enjoy the atmosphere and the people.
XIFIN|" Good place Overall they treat employees well. Greet employees with a smile even at 5 am in the morning on a Monday. Sometimes it was stressful, especially at the end of each month. Free sodas, coffee and tea. Bagels on Friday's was great. Healthcare was a little too high, supervisors were a little too extreme. Great work environment This is a great place to work but the pay could be better for all the things that are required to succeed in this job but overall I can’t say no many bad things about it Flexibility Pay Good place to learn Very nice place to learn. Working with coworkers as a team to accomplish metrics is always fun. Miscommunication or lacking answers to questions that employees have is not good. Training can and should be extended especially for people that are more life experienced. 1 A Bit Stressful at Times, Not enough necessary tools provided to be successful at the job XIFIN has potential, however there are so many unknown answers when it comes to the IRT Billing Department. Great pay and schedule, however the commute and the morning traffic will frustrate you before you even start your shift. Then to get to the office and be even more frustrated, stressed sometimes, after communicating with rude patients. Employee Perks Commute Not enough necessary tools provided to be successful at the job AR specialist This has been the worst job I've had in my life. If you are currently working please don't quit and come here. No training, constantly demanding for projects to be done with no instructions. No communication and everyday you just feel lost. Bagels on Monday Everything is con Excellent place to work I've been here less than two years but so far my experience has been great! Schedules and management team are flexible and allow you to enjoy a work/life balance. There is constant room for growth and advancement and a sense of community even for remote employees which is difficult to obtain. Benefits are decent but could possibly offer more PTO. Room for growth, Competitive pay, flexible work time/location, sense of community PTO benefits slightly low It's ok The job is easy, but the south Carolina office is very unorganized. Employees concerns are not being addressed. Office internet goes out and every other day. Easy, good schedule Unorganized, no support Fun and Fast Growing Company XIFIN has created a great company culture where you can enjoy coming to work. Most of the people I worked with were pleasant to work with and willing to help answer you questions. Opportunities to move up were scarce and very competitive. Management cared about production but were willing to give feedback. Great company culture Strict about breaks, clients were very demanding and rude Fun folks to work with For the most part its been great working at Xifin. The CEO has a great outlook and what 2021 will look like. We are taking on more customers which means great things for the employees Free lunch and snacks, team building, chance to move up or to different depts Pay, Schedule, Some of the managers Busy You’ll be busy With no support from other departments. Your expected to help customers by delaying the inevitable- bad experience - good luck with managing stress level Soda high stress Intern opportunities As an intern, I was challenged and respected. Lots of great people work here. Everyone was willing to help and I was given some exciting projects to work on. Great people, exciting atmosphere, lots of opportunity. Terrible job culture Worked there for several years. I had not worked that hard and treated so poorly since working retail while going to school at night. I'm not kidding, the place has a minimum wage culture and the longer you work there, the worse it gets. The company wants qualified people but ignore things like turnover, upper management toxicity and how it affects the overall atmosphere of the place. The company has a great concept and marketplace niche, but has not been able too get to the next level due to workplace, culture incompetence and an inability to retain or develop the talent they have. The worst part is that upper management knows it and still regards the problem with contempt. The place is stuck in the 80s. The CEO is brilliant, but her management style is a bit autocratic. I think she needs to stay out of the day-to-day work culture, quit signing off, and questioning every little thing, so that decisions can be made without her oversight. Free bagels on friday and ping pong table you will never have time to use. Overall culture, hierarchical management style. Very top down. Satisfied I've been around the block in this industry since 2004 from private practices, third-party billing to large hospital institutions and in my 2 years to now, Xifin has it right. The work is fast-paced, high-volume, complex and challenging so there is rarely a dull or easy day (which I appreciate) AND, this keeps the poser types that don't know anything or who are lazy out (they drown here and pretty quickly). The RS role is NOT for beginners. There is still some expected typical petty workplace drama, but little enough that it's usually avoidable. The the majority of time we are all too busy for that nonsense. Since Xifin writes and maintains their software, the other half of your job will include learning and understanding a lot of technical functions like automation, EDI, working in bulk, eligibility/claim status checks, etc. and how to tailor your customer's (lab) needs using these tools. Workplace attire is 100% casual, Einstein's bagels every Friday and we start as early as 6:00am (it was 5:00am before COVID) because at the end of the day, we want to go home after work! I've never been hassled about needing/taking time off or been conned into staying late; if anything everyone is waiting for the OT allowance to come back because we always have a ton to do. Xifin HR is offering meditation, yoga and exercise classes online since most of us are remote now as well and we have a fun committee that actually plans and does fun things! (birthday celebrations, outside of work events, games/contests for gift cards, etc). I am not usually one to trust businesses as most don't offer Casual attire/environment, early start hours, bagels on Fridays It can be a bureaucracy to get things done working with other depts. Cr***y company to work for. Working at this company is not great, you are constantly asked to do things out of your description or added more work load without being asked. It is a hostile environment and basically need to kiss a** to grow and for a promotion. The management at this company only favors that type of person, it is not based on knowledge and will hold you back from moving to a different position and if you are lucky enough to be granted the privilege of changing departments, then they will delay the process as much as they can. The company is a joke. None Everything. Poor company leadership and Pathetic Culture The company leader ship is extremely poor. You feel threatened when you work there. You can never advance. People are always brought in above you. Unfortunately, people are promoted not based on what they know but on how they conform to the oppressive culture. There are good people that work there but unfortunately they come and go quite quickly. In San Diego Senior management is dictatorial, condescending and the overall culture is highly negative. Many excellent employees work here There is an overall lack of communication from upper mgt downward. New tools get rolled out with no announcement. Pluses are this company keeps up with the latest technologies. Unsupportive Management Unfortunately I have not had a pleasant experience working for XIFIN. This would be the reason for looking at other career opportunities. The Management team does not communicate important information that affects the customers overall satisfaction. The work environment is very hostile. I do not feel supported by my manager. Great company I’ve been at XIFIN for a little over a year and very happy here. It’s like a family. The work is challenging but rewarding and I hope to be here for a long time. Everyone smiles on Mondays Great place to work. Employees seem happy to be there. Very comfortable work environment. Hardest part is the reports. Most enjoyable is that they really care about the little things to make employees happy. Free soda and coffee. Free bagels every friday. Ok Personnel are great to work with. Benefits good. Systems are highly advanced. Department management underdeveloped and embattled. Office space very nice and modern. Staff turnover very high. Work with great people. No chance for advancement as upper management is routinely recruited externally and internal advancement is not promoted. People were great but management was a little behind the times. People were great but management was a little behind the times. Never had enough people to handle the work load. Only hire extra help long after it should have been done. Casual Friday and free donuts on Friday Parking difficult sometimes Good place Overall they treat employees well. Greet employees with a smile even at 5 am in the morning on a Monday. Sometimes it was stressful, especially at the end of each month. Free sodas, coffee and tea. Bagels on Friday's was great. Healthcare was a little too high, supervisors were a little too extreme. Great company to work with Great teammates and previous management was awesome as they will help you learn the systems. If you made a mistake my pervious manager will guide you in the system on where to get the correct information. 1 Do not recommend this company Do not recommend this company. Please see glass door for a more thorough overview of this company. I would definitely steer clear from implementations and engineering. 1 ""Retirement Home"" for morally bankrupt Tech Management The most important thing to reflect on when considering whether you should work at Xifin is: Do you have a personal history of being slow to escape from an abusive relationship? While you may have significant skills or experience, these qualities are not highly valued at Xifin. Their engineering department has failed for years at retaining employees, and negative reviews keep piling up because they long ago stopped caring about their reputation. Xifin engineering managers are largely embittered over the company's failure to go public and make them all tech billionaires. They mostly despise and blame one other for this, and they haven't moved on to another company because they lost any interest in making an effort at their jobs roughly a decade ago. What unites them today is their desire to gain a feeling of superiority by projecting their feelings of anger, frustration, and inadequacy onto their employees. If you observe those who manage Xifin engineering you will witness some of the most juvenile and childishly unprofessional behavior you will ever see from adults this far along in their careers and their lives. Unfortunately, their attitude toward employees who don't quit within the first month is: by not leaving, you've proven that working at Xifin is the best that you can do for yourself in your life, and they are therefore righteous and justified in treating you worse as time goes on. The more abuse and mistreatment you put up with, the more they see you agreeing that their negative assessment is correct and that you're not qualified to work anywhere else. I have not witnessed any criminal or illegal behavior while working at Xifin. I did well but... My advice would be to not trust anyone. Agree with the employee who is closest to the top of the org chart. When confronted, blame shortfalls on the person no one likes. Try to go unnoticed. A typical day at work Consists of assisting and managing customers and accounts to maximize their revenue cycle; as well as service patients' needs with excellent customer service. It was a good stepping stone The job itself is okay. But management is unprofessional and you'll see no one stays there too long. The people are nice but management only looks out for those who are there friends or apart of there circle. Great Company Work is what you make it, I enjoyed working here and would definitely think about reapplying if I returned back to San Diego. They provide a healthy work environment and work with adapting protocols to help with ongoing changes. Hard to find good things to say The people here are running the company into the ground. Poor processes, no commitments between departments, and very top heavy. They do not pay anyone below a manager level well here, offer no training and no support with your job. I wasn't able to trust anyone I worked with here. Steer clear. Frendy, professional and relaxed work enviroment Great place to work for, is a friendly and relaxed work environment, fast pace turnaround at completing your daily tasks. Must have initiative and be able to work with little to non supervision. Friendly enviroment, free baggels on friday, semi casual attire The Best Revenue Cycle Solution for Laboratory Billing Xifin is an industry leader for Revenue Cycle Management in the hospital / laboratory space. A typical day is busy communicating with key accounts to ensure their vision of success is being met. Professional office with respect for hard work., Ability to achieve work / life balance. Some of the nicest people you will ever work with. Opportunities for advancement are nonexistent, which is common for smaller departments. High stress environment with no growth opportunities A typical day consists of maintaining company proprietary software. There's no opportunity to grow your skill set, you're basically stuck doing the same thing everyday. Staffed with people who lack training for their job roles. Free bagel fridays No bonuses, no professional growth Blue faces and false friendliness Great product. Same management for 20 years. Stale. SMEs ""don't have time"" to train new people. PMs are way over-tasked. Too many high maintenance clients. Free sodas No training or support Xifin review Good company.Busy call center. Most enjoyable part of job are the ""perks"". The biggest ""con"" if you are in the call center you there is really no ""down"" time during the day. bagels on Fridays short breaks Terribly managed, unorganized and unstable. Management does not care about the people, many live in fear for their jobs (there have been layoffs). No real process, lots of unnecessary work, finger pointing, arguments, raised voices. Dry as can be culture. Location, benefits Managent Management Company culture is all about the revenue to the company regardless of the impact to the customer/staff. Beginning to take customers 'live' on the system when not all of the needed information for the customer has been loaded/nor is the customer ready. Soda fountain, bagels on Friday Company culture Great place so far. I like it here and see some opportunities for improvement and management seems open to evolving. Looking forward to growth in the years to come. There are some people that have poor attitudes and that can be hard. Like working at INITECH Core management hasn't changed in 20 years. Afraid of new processes and ideas. Hard to get help when you need it. Minimal holidays. Culture is work work work. Competitive salaries Nightmares Great Company Xifin is a great company to work for. You have to be a multi task and able to handle one than one lab. The hardest part appealing with medical record. I love the people and growth of the company. Challenging work load Nice group of people. A lot of work to do that makes the day pass by quickly. Could offer more training for new employees. No real area for advancement. Free coffee and soda No area for advancement Great Place to work XIFIN is a great place to work. They listen to their employees and implement changes when feasible. The culture is improving and management is making changes in processes to make it a better place to work. There are some employees that have been around awhile that struggle with change but that is typical. Locker room with shower, free bagels on Friday, free soda, food trucks monthly, holiday and company events work load and pace can be a lot at times, but it does seem to ebb and flow so it balances out. Good place Overall they treat employees well. Greet employees with a smile even at 5 am in the morning on a Monday. Sometimes it was stressful, especially at the end of each month. Free sodas, coffee and tea. Bagels on Friday's was great. Healthcare was a little too high, supervisors were a little too extreme. .Good Company to work for I would recommend this company to work for, very understanding with their employees, they know employees have families and works with you to accommodate the needs of your family. A good place to work. Overall good place to work. It is what you make of it. I worked there during the early days, were long hours but the CEO took care of the original start up people. Would work there again. Good salary for certain positions Small company 1 2 Some people stay despite the toxicity Worked at xifin for almost 3 years and during that time saw people under qualified and under paid hired and placed in positions. Yet the hiring managers rave about them. Project Managers who cannot operate Excel or Outlook, product managers who do not understand the product and put the company at a disadvantage because they make promises that are difficult to keep and lastly employees who are not allowed to make decisions or change the antiquated processes, because there is no time. If this sounds like a company you would love working for and would allow your passion to take root, try dropping another xanax. The company has a toxic environment that is accepted and will not change. Hours are at minimum 8 - 5:30 with no telecommuting Leaders received their pay our already and are driving the workers into the ground No real training/ unorganized company Billing call center focused solely on metrics, did not care about the customers or resolving issues at all. Super stressful for anyone with a good work ethic as nothing could ever get done. I was only there for 2 weeks and trained by an employee who focused on telling off the supervisor. Asked both questions and received completely different answers. Felt as though the supervisor had no say or control of the department. Also noticed many other reps being rude and negative on the phone. Drinks (soda, coffee, water) were free. Free Friday bagels Unorganized, rude to patients, no upper management control High stress, low resources, micro-managed. Generally nice people running a profitable business by shortcutting and cutting costs Salaries were good but sometimes no amount of money is worth the stress and anxiety. Morale was low, gossip was high and deadlines were tight. Once a startup, always a start up XIFIN has been trying to grow beyond it self for over 16 years, yet does not change leadership or practices. They are a jump at the next opportunity, no matter the business cost or return. They disregard new practices brought in by new leadership and continue to promote for tenure rather than delivered results. And they wonder why they cannot deliver for their customers... Free sodas and candy Unpredictable goals, risk mitigation is ignored and continued pain for existing processes Busy and unorganized I currently work in the call center and it gets really busy on Mondays and Tuesdays nonstop calls all day. Each day I learn how to handle difficult calls as we get a lot of patient grievance calls due to missinformation provided to them. It does get stressful at times but I manage to get through the day. I believe managment should have more control of employees, I know they shouldn't babysit us but it is unfair for some to do more work than others. My department is very small and I enjoy working with them, however, I do not like that some take advantage of the manager and tell lies in regards to low production. The hardest part of my job is dealing with angry patients because they can be very disrespectful at times, however, I have learned to not take it personal. The most enjoyable part of my job is that each day I learn more about outpatient billing. benefits short breaks Very friendly enviroment and understanding Awesome place to work. Great enviroment, friendly people and an overall great company. The management team and HR are awesome. My grandmother recently passed and as a new employee they were totally understanding about the time I neede to take off. Thank you Xifin. Xifin Great product terrible place to work. You are taught to lie to customers and to sell a high level of service that can't be met due to the lack of caring from management. I would advise if you are contacted by a recruiter about a job to hang up the phone. I resigned and my clients were told I was fired. What a professional group of idiots. Some good people work there. Some people don't know what they are doing. Not what I expected * No SOP's *No Training on their own system, it was a learn as you go. Sink or swim *Very unprofessional management no training, unprofessional management Very busy but laid back The late shift does not have as much work to preform as the earlier shifts do, which at times means that you don't have anything to do. The management team was very informative and very willing to share information and knowledge. Bagels on Friday Late shift under paid, under appreciated While i did actually learn quite a bit during my short stay with Xifin, being pushed out after receiving exemplary remarks on my one and only performance evaluation by everyone who observed the presentation except my direct supervisor, who was absent from the evaluation doesn't make sense. It begins to look suspicious when it just so happens that i was just about to request FMLA due to a potential and eventually actual serious health concern when I'm told ""it's just not working out"" and how ""I'm not advancing as quickly as I should be at the 5 month point."" Again, this coming after exemplary marks on my one and only performance evaluation. This is not sour grapes but rather a cautionary tale to others. Xifin under pays and then expects exorbitant production and commitment. It was rare that i left the office before 7pm and was expected there by 8am at the latest. If we had an east coast customer then we were expected to be on their time, so 8am EST meant 5am PST, which in and of itself wouldn't be outrageous, but then still not getting out of the office until 7pm that night...once or twice, fine, but all the time? Like I said, they don't pay enough to hold those expectations. Management is like being in 2nd grade all over again, with a teachers pet, who can do no wrong, even when the client complains that she is doing wrong. Anyone who speaks out against the pet is admonished or instructed to fall in line or is mysteriously let go because he or she ""just wasn't working out."" The company offers no benefits above and beyond the standard healthcare, PTO and 401k (which of course free bagels on friday everything else Difficult place to work due to the type of work Medical collections for company that does not have contracts with the large insurance companies and refuse to allow us to get prior auths is a difficult task indeed. good professional environment not tolerant of personal issues, expectations very stringent Typical day Analyzing data to create better efficiencies and work flow processes is the foundation of my position with XIFIN. I create standard operation procedure (SOP) for each area and function in the billing department. The standard operating procedures act as a working document for the staff to use as guide for their assigned task(s) or roles. XIFIN’s Billing Department is fast paced, constant changes and multiple exceptions due to the customer’s products. I have the responsibility and the most rewarding aspect of the function; to fully understand and create workable documents for the staff. The SOP documents must address all facets of the customer’s exceptions, and policy guidelines. The constant changes limit the time required to perform each request so the staff’s training and the fast response to updating or creating a new SOP is crucial to the success of the process. The staff and management rely heavily on the documentation as a resource to the system and /or system updates. The documents have dual purposes; the documents serve as resource and work flow each billing and revenue function. employees partners in resolving issues. time constraints Good place Overall they treat employees well.

If you are currently working please don't quit and come here. No training, constantly demanding for projects to be done with no instructions. No communication and everyday you just feel lost. Bagels on Monday Everything is con Excellent place to work I've been here less than two years but so far my experience has been great! Schedules and management team are flexible and allow you to enjoy a work/life balance. There is constant room for growth and advancement and a sense of community even for remote employees which is difficult to obtain. Benefits are decent but could possibly offer more PTO. Room for growth, Competitive pay, flexible work time/location, sense of community PTO benefits slightly low It's ok The job is easy, but the south Carolina office is very unorganized. Employees concerns are not being addressed. Office internet goes out and every other day. Easy, good schedule Unorganized, no support Fun and Fast Growing Company XIFIN has created a great company culture where you can enjoy coming to work. Most of the people I worked with were pleasant to work with and willing to help answer you questions. Opportunities to move up were scarce and very competitive. Management cared about production but were willing to give feedback. Great company culture Strict about breaks, clients were very demanding and rude Fun folks to work with For the most part its been great working at Xifin. The CEO has a great outlook and what 2021 will look like. We are taking on more customers which means great things for the employees Free lunch and snacks, team building, chance to move up or to different depts Pay, Schedule, Some of the managers Busy You’ll be busy With no support from other departments. Your expected to help customers by delaying the inevitable- bad experience - good luck with managing stress level Soda high stress Intern opportunities As an intern, I was challenged and respected. Lots of great people work here. Everyone was willing to help and I was given some exciting projects to work on. Great people, exciting atmosphere, lots of opportunity. Terrible job culture Worked there for several years. I had not worked that hard and treated so poorly since working retail while going to school at night. I'm not kidding, the place has a minimum wage culture and the longer you work there, the worse it gets. The company wants qualified people but ignore things like turnover, upper management toxicity and how it affects the overall atmosphere of the place. The company has a great concept and marketplace niche, but has not been able too get to the next level due to workplace, culture incompetence and an inability to retain or develop the talent they have. The worst part is that upper management knows it and still regards the problem with contempt. The place is stuck in the 80s. The CEO is brilliant, but her management style is a bit autocratic. I think she needs to stay out of the day-to-day work culture, quit signing off, and questioning every little thing, so that decisions can be made without her oversight. Free bagels on friday and ping pong table you will never have time to use. Overall culture, hierarchical management style. Very top down. Satisfied I've been around the block in this industry since 2004 from private practices, third-party billing to large hospital institutions and in my 2 years to now, Xifin has it right. The work is fast-paced, high-volume, complex and challenging so there is rarely a dull or easy day (which I appreciate) AND, this keeps the poser types that don't know anything or who are lazy out (they drown here and pretty quickly). The RS role is NOT for beginners. There is still some expected typical petty workplace drama, but little enough that it's usually avoidable. The the majority of time we are all too busy for that nonsense. Since Xifin writes and maintains their software, the other half of your job will include learning and understanding a lot of technical functions like automation, EDI, working in bulk, eligibility/claim status checks, etc. and how to tailor your customer's (lab) needs using these tools. Workplace attire is 100% casual, Einstein's bagels every Friday and we start as early as 6:00am (it was 5:00am before COVID) because at the end of the day, we want to go home after work! I've never been hassled about needing/taking time off or been conned into staying late; if anything everyone is waiting for the OT allowance to come back because we always have a ton to do. Xifin HR is offering meditation, yoga and exercise classes online since most of us are remote now as well and we have a fun committee that actually plans and does fun things! (birthday celebrations, outside of work events, games/contests for gift cards, etc). I am not usually one to trust businesses as most don't offer Casual attire/environment, early start hours, bagels on Fridays It can be a bureaucracy to get things done working with other depts. Cr***y company to work for. Working at this company is not great, you are constantly asked to do things out of your description or added more work load without being asked. It is a hostile environment and basically need to kiss a** to grow and for a promotion. The management at this company only favors that type of person, it is not based on knowledge and will hold you back from moving to a different position and if you are lucky enough to be granted the privilege of changing departments, then they will delay the process as much as they can. The company is a joke. None Everything. Poor company leadership and Pathetic Culture The company leader ship is extremely poor. You feel threatened when you work there. You can never advance. People are always brought in above you. Unfortunately, people are promoted not based on what they know but on how they conform to the oppressive culture. There are good people that work there but unfortunately they come and go quite quickly. In San Diego Senior management is dictatorial, condescending and the overall culture is highly negative. Many excellent employees work here There is an overall lack of communication from upper mgt downward. New tools get rolled out with no announcement. Pluses are this company keeps up with the latest technologies. Unsupportive Management Unfortunately I have not had a pleasant experience working for XIFIN. This would be the reason for looking at other career opportunities. The Management team does not communicate important information that affects the customers overall satisfaction. The work environment is very hostile. I do not feel supported by my manager. Great company I’ve been at XIFIN for a little over a year and very happy here. It’s like a family. The work is challenging but rewarding and I hope to be here for a long time. Everyone smiles on Mondays Great place to work. Employees seem happy to be there. Very comfortable work environment. Hardest part is the reports. Most enjoyable is that they really care about the little things to make employees happy. Free soda and coffee. Free bagels every friday. Ok Personnel are great to work with. Benefits good. Systems are highly advanced. Department management underdeveloped and embattled. Office space very nice and modern. Staff turnover very high. Work with great people. No chance for advancement as upper management is routinely recruited externally and internal advancement is not promoted. People were great but management was a little behind the times. People were great but management was a little behind the times. Never had enough people to handle the work load. Only hire extra help long after it should have been done. Casual Friday and free donuts on Friday Parking difficult sometimes"
Adobe|" Fun Really good benefits and like a family cultire also really busy schedule. Good holidays and privatw life work balance all in sll suggest to work in adobe Excellent place to work Awesome team to work with excellent place to grow the career. Would work with all the teams, Good employee recognition good company benefits with exc. As the culture gets larger, individuals have no say It used to be a much better place to work. The pandemic and I'm not sure what else seems to have tipped things upside down and it feels disconnected and lacking in purpose except to work hard, hard, hard individual managers care Bureaucracy Fun place to work Team oriented and really care about employees. Free lunches, many Department activities. Management was easy to talk to and felt like I was important. They gave me the opportunity to grow. I started off as a production line assembler and ended being in inventory control. Stock options Too much overtime. Productive and fun place Overall a good place to work at, remote culture is nice, managers are helpful and overall team members are sweet and kind. Pay standards could be updared Hit or miss company, but the misses are h*ll on earth. I have worked here since 2020 and it feels like management forgets this every week or so. You will not get adequate support with onboarding, there are so many holes in documentation and the engineers are so overloaded that they are not willing to help at all. You will be confused and alone, express this, and still get no help and get all the blame in this regard. Ensure your manager is good before you join, this is a huge determiner of your experience. Poor management, no innovation, unfulfilling work. Enjoyable place to work, happy to see Mondays Interesting work and great colleagues - Adobe cares about it's people. Would recommend Adobe as a place to work. Always learning due to fast product development. However, progression to leadership roles is difficult as there are few opportunities. Interesting products, always more to learn, healthy workplace culture, flexibility, largest client's in region Lack of progression opportunities Excellent culture for a large company For a large company, Adobe has an excellent culture for its employees. It strives for diversity and inclusion but can be slow moving at times (but Adobe is very big). There is a lot of variation depending on what team/business unit you are in. Some places have better engineering practices and career growth than others. Depending on your level, it can be hard to find a path for advancement. Overall culture, salary Variability among teams, advancement Hardly any con. Good people, small teams, lots of growth opportunity, good perks. I was a SWE intern and the expectations were reasonable and even very busy people made time for me. Everyone always encouraged me and celebrated my successes. Only thing would be a lack of diversity in some of the engineering teams (mine included) Sales Managers can be bullies It's all about the accounts you get. Some of the sales managers can be bullies and have their favorites. Very little support unless you have a super large deal. A fun job with plenty of hours. you had to get the documents ready to ship with shipment. Communicate with others on the status of the documents. File packing slips and look up shipments for customers. The friends their are nice too. 4 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Benefits, esp. the sabattical What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Long hrs expected. bottom X% are laid off annually right around the holidays What is the work environment and culture like at the company? great supportive and inclusive Best place to work I have been here for 4 years and it has been by far, the best experience that I have ever had at a company. The culture is so inclusive, and the compensation and benefits are the best I have ever experienced. Culture, time off, flexibility of workspace, top leadership, and compensation Stress and bias for action can be a bit overwhelming, but it keeps it interesting. I just joined but I felt that Adobe gives value to every individual I just joined but I felt that Adobe gives value to every individual. My manager is very focused and appreciative. It has tons of material for self-learning and is partnered with many external learning platforms. Benefits are good but the only cons I would say is managing multiple small projects at the same time when the expectation is not properly defined. It sometimes causes anxiety while filling timesheet Una gran empresa para trabajar, trabajo en equipo, colaboración, constante esfuerzo para hacer equipo. Una excelente empresa, innovadora, siempre en dinámica de cambio, nuevos productos y capacidades que es muy difícil dar seguimiento. Liderazgo de empuje pero a veces muy estresante. Aunque la empresa cuida el balance de vida las exigencias diarias terminan en jornadas extensas de 10 horas diarias por lo menos. Acercamientos regulares para hacerte sentir parte del equipo. Adobe culture truly reflects its core values Genuine - Exceptional - Innovative - Involved Adobe employees exhibit these values. Leadership expects the same of themselves Terrific place for personal & professional growth with terrific benefits. Outstanding Soltions Consistent focus on Customer Satisfaction Exciting, fast paced, innovative & challenging environment Hard to replicate these pros at other companies Great place to work, best job I've ever had There's a time when you realize that going to work is a joy and you've lost track of the time again building something that you can be pretty proud. As a bonus you've helped plenty of friends and customers and other folks do something creative and meaningful. I got the chance to enable books to be published, art to be appreciated, and deadlines to be met when people took advantage of my skills and knowledge that I freely gave because I could. All that and a bag of chips happened at Adobe. Almost too many to list Some California-related management stuff great work/life balance The best thing for me was the work/life balance. But with that comes missed opportunities that only comes if you're willing to get outside your comfort zone. great opportunities for advancement and learning if you're willing to learn outside your domain you get to work on the same thing using different technologies as the team/product scales and evolve Opportunity The most important benefit of working at Adobe is that the company provides opportunities to play your role to the best of your ability, or invent a role that does allow you room to grow. Unlimited opportunity for the hard worker Too many MBA's! Lack of balance/support during pandemic. Note- Hired and left during COVID WFH Work was well defined and paid. Company itself was great and fantastic benefits. Seemed to be a function/team specific issue and advancement couldn't come soon enough to wait it out. Customers can be very needy and you will end up needing to work beyond 9-6 most days. Management is generally supportive but I found many un-supportive teammates. Attempts to reach out for help were often met with dismissal or rude response from senior employees. Folks outside of the support org especially very rude to support engineers. Best company in the world. Everything about this company is superb: culture, compensation, work life balance, working environment, work-life balance, fast paced development, and of course - dedicated and fun TEAM. Great stock options, education compensation, free schedule, perfect hardware I really can’t think of any Fun Really good benefits and like a family cultire also really busy schedule. Good holidays and privatw life work balance all in sll suggest to work in adobe Great company! Absolutely great company! After 5 years in the company, I made friends for my whole life and had fantastic work experience. Excellent working conditions, progressive management. During my journey with Adobe, I got 2 times promoted. Everything is great No Great for Interns Definitely a great internship experience due to everything you can learnand everyone you can meet. It was remote for me though so it lost a lot of aspects such as connecting with people organically, but overall a great place to learn. 1 Adobe Nice place to work, layback people, some of the code is very messy. They are advancing the field of AR. You will solve some hard problems. The people you work with are nice and helpfull. Nice Folks, Remote, work life balance I am stuck in an inglorious position as contractor, I just need a role change. It has nice cafeteria and ping pong table. 1. The Review system is serious and the manager evaluates you at every work you do and the feedbacks from the customer. 2. the office atmosphere is good but the stress level is quite high. 3. Company encourages to learn new skill sets but for me I can only find limited time to learn new stuffs. Good work/life balance, management is a letdown Little job security for contractors of which they use as full-time employees. Work/life balance however is terrific, and colleagues are easy to work with. Work/Life Balance Management, No vision for future state productive and nice work culture adobe is a great place to work, great benefits, unlimited PTO, creative and nice work culture, and great work flexibility depending on what team you are on. Great benefits and co workers, hard to advance Adobe provides it's employees with every benefit they could need, with fair compensation in terms of salary, albeit a bit below market value compared with similar companies. However, with a company of this size, it's hard to move up in the ladder without really overexerting yourself to make your work stand out. Benefits, co-workers, fair management Long work days, feels like you're in a rat race at times Great company! Joined after receiving my MBA, great company for recent gras. Amazing benefits, team members go out of their way to help you out, even folks in different BU's. Cool products and great work life balance. Offers continuous training and business development, and they assign you impactful work. Management really cares about every employee and also provides fun team building events. - Perks (health fund, free snacks / drinks, pay for public transportation to work); flexible working environment, empathetic managers; amazing, intelligent, and friendly co-workers; company is seeing great growth and the atmosphere is really transparent Can't think of any Great Management and Culture awesome company to work for. They have very professional and personal leadership at all levels. Extremely innovative and clear strategy. They are on a roll! Great Benefits lots of hours (but so does the whole team) They added benefit before you knew you needed them. Always looking out for their employees, Excellent employer. They think of benefits that you need before you could think to ask. Can't say enough good about them. a creative place to work in I enjoyed collaborating with different creatives on projects. The work environment was fast paced but rewarding. There were constantly new projects to work on and old projects to finish. Toxic Woke climate Adobe is unfortunately a Terrible place to work. I just transitioned from acquisition company and I am completely stunned at how political the climate is here. So called ""Adobe for all"" is nothing more than corporate cancel culture. Unless you have the right skin color or other preferences it’s barely even covert you are to keep your mouth shut. Work elsewhere is my recommendation Remote office Bad culture, no PPO, extremely leftist political views Time for work and play It was great to work on software that helped people's productivity and creativity. People are treated like adults who can manage their time efficiently. There is a stocked kitchen, video game consoles, pingpong, etc. Benefits are generous. Smart people, good pay and benefits Management can be a bit lax Rewarding and challenging It's a great place to work. Rewarding and flexible, with a focus on employee well-being. The best people rise to the top, usually. I feel appreciated and rewarded for the work I do. People-first culture Some positions understaffed Too political I recommend people who wants to work here to learn to be more political than being smart. I had a manager that was managing the division like 7-11. That's why i quit. Great office space Too political Well paid to sweat the details Good fundamentals and strategy but needs a qualified COO. Command and control culture in some groups. Holiday shutdowns are good practice and benefits are solid. Stagnant Corporation Masquerading as Tech Innovator Adobe has two good products, photoshop and Acrobat (PDF Reader). They have had these two products for over two decades. All other product releases failed. Yes, some people use them, but any usage is strictly attributable to Adobe‘s brand recognition, and not the actual proficiency of the product. The culture at Adobe is bland. It is nonexistent, it is cold. None of the budget is allocated towards team morale activities. During my 15 months there, I think there was one happy hour. Their technology is a mess, their leader ship is embarrassing, and worst of all, the company has no clear-cut direction. Nobody can actually tell you what the company is working towards. Essentially, Photoshop pays the bills and that’s all that matters. Great Benefits & Decent Compensation Low morale, Nonexistent Senior Leadership, Too Big, No Coheson Egos and politics Too many egos once you are director level or above. Too many layers of mgmt and egos to work around to get anything done. Adobe knows b2c but still has no clue on B2B mid market and SMB. Likes to buy solid MM companies, keep the mgmt team for a year and then they all leave or are let go...Marketo, Magento, Echo Sign, and more are good examples. Cafe, salary and smart ppl Egos, bullies and many leaders have been there too long. Good perks, insurance and education benefits A lot of product team(support and sales) in India works in night shifts unless you are in the core engineering team. Rest everything is good. Not many IJP opportunities. so learn and move out free food, education reimbursement, health benefits night shifts, average hikes Relaxed culture and supportive coworkers I really enjoy my time as an intern at Adobe although the position is remote, I feel moderately connected. Really nice manager, and helpful coworkers. The benefits are amazing, and the pay is awesome! I have nothing to complain. Great company culture Low impact work Fun Really good benefits and like a family cultire also really busy schedule. Good holidays and privatw life work balance all in sll suggest to work in adobe Find a better company, I dare you Adobe is incredible, at least in Utah. I love working there and plan to spend as many years there as they'll have me! Compensation is fair and the people are top notch. 1 Good culture with decent work Interned at Adobe during the summer. I found the team and the people around to be helpful. The company culture is unmatched. Ownership of product is encouraged. Wellness benefits, Good pay None Great company I love the company but the teams can be hit or miss. Most teams are based in SF/San Jose so if you want to advance, location is something to keep in mind. I learn a lot here. My Manager is really great. Help me to clear understand with the work instruction and goal and support in each way to succeed in those goal. I learn a lot here. bureaucratic & process oriented organization Could be good or bad, depending on what you want. Adobe is process defined organization, hence things move slowly. You will need lot of approvals from various set of stakeholders, which points a lot of accountability on your head. Fun and Productive Environment to Work in It feel's young with people full of energy with nice office environment one can image. Team work is a must and many technical meeting by developers of all levels to review and form new actionable ideas. Office environment and location On-site parking is limited; open envirment tend to be noisy in general Great company for individuals truly interested in technology Great place for truly talented individuals seeking to make a difference, but the work culture seems to have taken a hit in recent years especially in business organizations. Beware There are good managers and bad ones. Hopefully you get a good one. They prioritize diversity to the point that it becomes detrimental. It would be one thing if internal diversity were commensurate with the community at large, however, that is not the case. The end result is the reverse discrimination. Good luck. Great and stable company if you're full-time I loved working at Adobe, but being a contractor made me feel like a second class citizen. My team was great, but there was no room for advancement and I was stonewalled when I wanted to pursue more advanced tasks and projects and take on more responsibility. TVC culture is a pox and actively works against individual growth. But the cafeteria was great I guess. Good team work As an individual contributor, you really have a lot of autonomy in the work you do and can make big plays with your team. Orders don't come down from executives -- the teams decide what they want to do and how to do it, start to finish, on their own terms. You of course get direction and insight from people higher up, but engineers, product managers, designers, and business stakeholders all work together in autonomous teams to make things happen. As a Data Analyst, your work is always high impact, and you get to shape how your team operates. Ping Pong As a contractor, there seems to be a negative treatment to contractors versus full-time employees. Contractors are not provided there own workspace, and each day bumped to other locations. Adobe's amenities are not equally provided to all employees, just full-timers. This treatment makes a person feel like an outcast in a culture that is pretty cool for those that are brought on full-time. Contribution to the success of the business is equal, however, not culture. My specific manager did not have emotional intelligence and treated her subordinate poorly, even those that were full-time. Other teams I worked with seemed very happy, and their bosses were pretty friendly and eager to help other teams. The work itself was excellent, and the experience of utilizing one of the most powerful marketing platforms and analytics to generate interest in Adobe's products and services was a privilege and would enjoy working there if offered a position ""full-time."" One lousy boss out of many was just bad luck. N/a Very awesome experience. The people are genuine, happy to help. I was able to learn from across the company. You just need to reach out to people. Good luck Great Culture. Slow Growth I enjoyed my time at Adobe. I learned and grew in my career. The Sales culture is different than the overall company culture. Advancing and feeling secure don't come with the sales role. Great Culture and Place to Work Slow Compensation and Position Growth Lack of mission and focus at every level This is very siloed company. Each group operates under a different management structure. The management structures vary from agile to okr to their own inventions. Innovation is stymied by the lack of coordination between teams. Overall a very top down environment. Great place to stick around if you have an ever-evolving role As a member of IT, I've had the pleasure of speaking/working with folks from almost every type of role within the company. There is so much opportunity here at Adobe, but some roles may leave little room for advancement and require lateral moves in order to allow for upward mobility. Although my IT org doesn't allow for work-from-home opportunities, the offices are very accommodating in terms of comforts and productivity needs. I left a job that allowed for 100% remote work so that I could commute and show up here every day, and I have no complaints about it. Pay is alright. Competitive rates for IT are definitely out there, considering the growing scope of work for IT roles here. The benefits here are excellent. I really get a brain break during the bi-annual shutdowns (a week during July 4th and a week during Christmas/New Years). Management is management. They're not always skilled to have a comprehending head in the foxholes with members of the roles they oversee, so this can be frustrating when their personality lacks empathy on top of unfamiliarity of inner workings. This isn't specific to Adobe, it's just how managers can be anywhere you go. Maybe more promotion from within would help here, but sometimes personalities are more important that backgrounds when it comes to leadership. If you work in Adobe, don't do it in a remote office Comp was good, especially the stock purchase plan. Worked in the NYC but most decisions made in San Jose without input. Management in company is not so great. If you're not working on one of the core products, you're not treated so well. Meh... Great company overall I love Adobe and what they stand for, it gets me energized hearing about it at each employee meeting. Overall it's fantastic, and I can't ask for anything better, but it can be very PC and hard to grow your career upwards. Nice place to work if Adobe has good projects Good projects to work on but recently the head hancos they are sending work to overseas, so basically stealing jobs from America and sending to overseas. Worklife balance is great Work life balance is excellent. There are a lot of smart folks you can collaborate ideas with here. I have a family and my boss is understanding of my schedule and fair. Worklife balance lunches are not always consistantly good. They look good but do not taste good most of the time People's company Adobe values its people and is a great company to work with. Adobe has great values and it tries to live by them. The company does an amazing job at diversity and inclusion. Adobe promotes work life balance for its employees and offers some really great benefits. Fun Really good benefits and like a family cultire also really busy schedule. Good holidays and privatw life work balance all in sll suggest to work in adobe Good Great place to work and fun people looking around and a very high-functioning energetic atmosphere. also bonuses and Retreats of business outings and very kind people too be around A typical Bay area company Please don't get carried away by name. It's a typical bay area company. They do fire employee more often then any other big companies so there is nothing like job security. what I am interested in doing at work I can make advertising posters and I can also sell products, I would like to work helping people find their products and make recommendations I am interested in helping and being kind to the client Good Place To Work, but nothing is steady. Good place but always shifting for better or worse so be prepared. Sometimes the company organization are not aware of the structure of other acquired companies, making it difficult for others to succeed once acquired. Great Benefits Insecure position. Fun, happy workplace Very diverse, generous and enjoyable company. People look very happy. It offers great benefits than most companies. Company growth is amazing. I did not any negative experience so far. Fun, hard workers, don't take themselves too seriously. Great perks. Great company. Casual workplace. Hard workers. Great perks. Loved working there. Would recommend it to anyone. Beautiful campus in San Francisco. Great access to Adobe products for employees. Good ideas, poor execution Pushing the Adobe brand and illustrating the benefits of using Adobes Creative Suite for video production, editing, and always focused on the goal of the excellent products provide by Adobe. Very good place to work. Adobe is a great company to work for with smart and fun people. My projects are all focused around M&A which is driven by CIO office. I always keep user experience in mind when defining the products and working with development. My current manager is difficlt to deal with I love working at Adobe. I think the overall culture is great, most people that I've talked to have been supportive and genuine. I do think that my current issue is with my current management. My current manager often behaves like a bully and I currently feel defeated by the way that we interact. I do not think that I'm given a lot of respect or trust, and I believe that my career is currently hindered by that. Productive and fun workplace with good benefits I had a very good time working at Adobe. Decent work/life balance and good benefits. I only left to go back to software development, but for a QA it's a very good company. good work life balance Adobe is a matured company with great leadership in IT and overall. My interactions with most of the Adobe employees has been amazing . very understanding and supportive. Bad behavior by well tenured managers Managers don’t know the job market because they have been there 17+ years. Bullies because they have “friends”. Some act as if they are the title of their managers and are mentally brutal at time because they know the culture more than the newbies. Adobe really cares about employee retention. I worked at Magento, an Adobe company. The takeover was smooth, and we were all well compensated. Some offices were closed, but employees there were offered relocation, helped with visas, and more. From what I've seen, Adobe employees tend to actually care about the company a lot. The social side of the work is always buzzing, from slack to regular events, hackathons, happy hours, and festive celebrations. Workwise... a strange support of open plan offices is the only nit I can pick, the management supports and encourages you to stretch yourself outside the box of merely working Kanban tickets day in and day out: you're encouraged to pick up projects to work on, give presentations to others about them, and so on. World Wide Adobe Managed Services The business culture is very respectful in the interactions with the employees, sharing of resources and polite manners. There are constant changes in schedules and interaction with customers, sales team and product improvements. Rewarding Career The Adobe products are top-notch and colleagues prioritized your success and career satisfaction. I was placed in challenging yet rewarding roles with some ambiguous objectives and route to completion but the support to act independently was generally supported and rewarded. A great chapter in my career KPS Kind people, great benefits Adobe is a great place to work, especially if you have a great boss that keeps you in the loop of the management strategy of his team. The admin team is extremely friendly and supportive. Quiet but nice place to work A quiet office but the people in it are tight knit and hard working. Work life balance is probably the best thing here, with lots of flexibility to work from home. Amazing work environment! Overall company culture is amazing! Tools are in place to ensure your success. Hardest part of the job for the department I was in was the long hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people. Great working environment Fast paced environment. Company has above average benefits and perks. Lots of great people met many lifelong friends. Harshest part at times were long hours. As with many companies lots of work and not enough staff to get everything completed. Grateful Some things could have been better, but overall I'm grateful for the experiences. Too many meetings, too low compensation, too many ineffective managers - but can't beat the work life balance. Hope to be able to return one day. Fun Really good benefits and like a family cultire also really busy schedule. Good holidays and privatw life work balance all in sll suggest to work in adobe This job is realy most secure but only if you keep learn it uniformly. It is best if you continues learn it. Then it is a most fun-full and be comfortable job for life time.And if you stop learning then its like to give up your future. 1 Amazing work atmosphere, good pay You get to work with talented creatives from all over the world. There's a lot of room for advancement, however it is important to have good relationships in order to move up. unlimited snacks and drinks, good pay contractors are not treated the same as regular employees, lots of work contracting Excellent Company to work at... Adobe has a very positive work culture. Friendly, smart people. Great cafeteria and places to meet and greet others working at the company. You will enjoy working here, especially if you are the creative sort of person. Great culture, smart people, creative environment Some groups may be a bit closed. Great Place to Work Great Place to Work. One of the Best company to work. Team members are supportive, Caring. Ultimate goal is successful product release. Everyone Jumps in to this effort. Outstanding leadership and team development Great place in all ways. I feel well equipped to handle independent work environments. Leading the technical win on enterprise accounts. Adobe has empowered me to present, sell and plan for all C-level meetings. Understanding the value of all Experience cloud solutions and how best to listen to customer needs was core to all enablement at Adobe. Great people, high performance necessary I really enjoyed working for Adobe. Great colleagues. Fantastic products. Never a dull moment and always something new to learn or tackle. Appropriate review process. Great compensation. Innovative company culture with great benefits Adobe is a great company to work for. They have a culture where people are encouraged to be innovative and come up with new solutions to leading edge problems. They provide excellent compensation and benefits as well. Amazing place to work- one big family My experience at Adobe was invaluable. They cared about me as an individual and encouraged me to grow my career. Adobe constantly gave me opportunities to challenge myself. Horrible culture and coworkers Adobe is a growing company with tons of opportunities. Unfortunately, the group I was in had awful culture. My manager would use improper language to criticize how I look in my employee picture, and she never really worked with me to develop a plan for my career growth even if I was fully prepared to discuss. The remote culture made me ( as a new hire) had no one to interact with everyday in the office. I was always alone even though most people in my team were based in the city that I was located. I couldn't build any relationship and I couldn't experience any Adobe culture other than joining the company meetings. People were gossiping and were speaking ill of others behind their backs, which is so unprofessional. If you are looking for a great working culture, then I don't think Adobe is a good place for you. Wow I was hired in December. I knew that Adobe was a good company when I applied but as I found out more about it during the interview and job offer process, I was absolutely amazed. The benefits and perks are easily superior to any other company I’ve ever worked for. I have been in technology for over 30 years so I’ve worked in good jobs for a number of good companies, large and small, and Adobe has really wowed me. One of the best places to work! This job has been one of the best job and group of people I've ever worked with. The environment is very collaborative and I love working with a group of very smart people. The product is constantly improving for our customer experience so it is always exciting to learn what is new to enable our customers to get more value out of our solution. Benefits are great and I love the summer & winter breaks, not to mention the sabbatical time off we get after every 5 year work anniversary. This is an amazing company and I do not see myself leaving Adobe any time soon. Espp, summer & winter company-wide break, sabbatical, one of the best health benefits package budget constraints with our work essential equipment refresh Great place to work and have life Great Products, extremely good work-life balance. Management crossing teams are totally different. You can see lots of gaps between teams. Work for a younger team is lucky. Planning could improve Prefer not to disclose. It could be that it was just this particular group. Planning takes too long. THere is too much focus on detail and it slows down the project. A great work place Every team member that I had were result oriented, getting job done perfectly was the goal in everyone's mind. Helping each other with all heart out was amazing. Great benefits and smart people I love working at Adobe! The benefits are top notch and most of the people are amazing to work with. The CEO is always inspiring and active in the press. healthcare, paid sabbatical every 5 years, doesn't count time off hart to get a remote position Great place to work. Adobe really cares about providing employees with amenities they need. Adobe is a healthy track company that believes in good heath habits. Everyone is treated equally. We have all cultures in our facilities. Lots of amenities You have to always be prepared to save a life if needed. Le meilleur travail Travailler chez Adobe a été la meilleure expérience de ma vie, sans cela, je ne serais pas la personne que je suis aujourd'hui. Productive and Fun place to work This company is such are large company but fun place to work. The company itself is growing really fast and one year is different from the next. Always looking ahead. Great company to work for Adobe is a fantastic company, and I've enjoyed working for them. They have fantastic leadership with integrity, strong company values, and they're hugely supportive of charitable causes. I only wish they supported flexible hours or working from home more. Highly Recommend the Company Adobe at large is great, but your experience will vary based on your org and direct manager. Overall, a great company making interesting products for a variety of customers."
Splunk|" Great company unless you are stuck with a bad manager. Loved the company and culture. It was positive and supportive. Unfortunately, I got stuck with a new and inexperienced manager who wanted to hire her friends and less experience people. So I had to go. Great culture, good benefits. A bad manager can turn a great company to a bad job. 2 Best workplace culture since my time in the Air Force People are encouraged to do their best and they are passionate to do so. With that said, I have never felt like I was in competition with my colleagues and have been supported since day one of coming here. 1 Productive and supportive culture Good for techies. Lot of learning opportunities! People are overall good to work with. Job security is there with promotion growth. Product management can be better over all to lead the goals 2 Fun and inclusive environment Pros: great work-life balance managers who actually treat you like human collaborative environment cons: many org changes lack of training (manager to employee, lack of manager training overall) Great company! I had a bad skip level manager but other than that Splunk is an amazing culture and inclusive environment! Very interesting work and a solid company! Understandable workload and balance When you work here you can really get the job done and the work load is an understandable amount of you can keep up with it. All in all had a decent time with them. Awesome company to work It was great , now its good but not sure what the future holds, after change in management things are going south a lot these days. Splunk is a great place to learn, and accelerate your career Great teams to work with Splunk has a great culture, nice work life balance, and great collaboration between the teams. However, always changing procedures and sometimes no one really knows what to do internally. I've met some of the best people I've ever worked with I have to say the people are what make Splunk amazing. Sure, it's a great product that has a large footprint globally - and it continues to grow & succeed. But the PEOPLE that are hired are by far the best I've ever worked with. Typically sales can be high strung, demanding and overall not pleasant 100% of the time. I've worked in support at Splunk for several years and I've never once had a negative interaction with a person in sales. And I covered globally over the years..... Good perks, free meals and stocked breakroom. Supports remote employment Vote Union Yes Management treats the workers very poorly especially through this last year. It is come to our attention that we could unionize and use our right of collective bargaining to improve conditions! Food Management Hyper growth, well paid Splunk continues to operate in hyper growth mode with lots of opportunity and upside from a career and stock perspective. However, the pace of change is insanely fast and leadership is getting worse and worse at managing changes across an increasingly growing employee base (ie major reorgs every quarter, teams being created and merged and completely disbanded, new companies being acquired left and right, etc) Pay, leadership, product Work life balance, no change management Great company One of the best companies I’ve worked for. They treat their employees like gold and you are paid well if you exceed your goals. They have a great work life balance and the best people I’ve ever had the pleasure of working with. Fun place to work with good people Fun place to work with good people. Fun employee events, lots of free food. Everyone s\worked well together, the culture was great. Highly recommend. Great products and vision but going through growing pains Splunk has been a great company for years and it is growing rapidly. With that come growing pains, new leadership that does not fit the culture, unclear direction and silos. It is not easy to advance or find another career opportunities within. The products and CEOs long-term vision, however, are great. productive and fun Great company. Productive atmosphere and fun and productive. I wonder if it is such a great place, I think it is just is growing so quickly it can be a bit disorienting. Come for the job, stay for the money A tech company that resists growing up. Why should they? So far Splunk's making money hand over fist. Commitment to employees and breakthrough thinking is deeply lacking. Very little is thought through by executives or managers. Sales and marketing are paramount; engineers hold much product development power. Diversity is strongly promoted but not fully supported beyond display to the world. Quite a disappointment. Many hang on for the big paychecks and bonuses. Relaxed Environment Splunk is a great place to work with opportunities to grow.I have learned so much since i started working with Splunk. They listen to your suggestions and treat people fairly. fun place to work in with diversity great place to work with diverse crowd and new technologies to learn. people are helpful and we learn a lot from each other with new tools and skills set Like a start-up Energetic and fast-paced work. Metric recognized. Ideas appreciated. Growing pains which management continually is keeping an eye on. Fun. Work is impactful. Fun place to work Splunk Inc helps organizations ask questions, get answers, take actions and achieve business outcomes from their data. Organizations use market-leading Splunk solutions with machine learning to monitor, investigate and act on all forms of business, IT, security Free meals lack of personal development programs productive and start up culture I enjoyed working at Splunk and had the opportunity to expand my skill set and grow in my career. This company had a laid back culture that was very fun while still being productive. Great company unless you are stuck with a bad manager. Loved the company and culture. It was positive and supportive. Unfortunately, I got stuck with a new and inexperienced manager who wanted to hire her friends and less experience people. So I had to go. Great culture, good benefits. A bad manager can turn a great company to a bad job. 2 Ageist and insecure. Unprofessional and inexperienced management. Management is young, inexperienced, and untrained. Massive growth in a short time frame led to many technical employees promoted without the correct skills to manage. Company is therefore led by a contracted third party company (also young and clueless) that is only interested in keeping their contract. Management is not interested in solutions. Lack of experience results in extreme insecurity among management. They hired and fired four veteran contractors (for a long-term contract) within a month. This is not a place anyone, particularly a seasoned contractor, should be. Video games, ping pong table. Never saw them used once. Free snacks. Video games and ping pong table are window dressing to convince employees of a relaxed environment, but it is a pretense. It is not collaborative or welcoming. 15 1 Miss working there People there are fun to work with there, they treat you good, there is always fun events going on and the company knows how to take care of their employee's 1 Good learning experience Good learning experience. Product is doing very well. Co-workers are great to work with. Though morale at my department is one of the lowest I have experienced. No job security very high turnover. Constantly evolving workplace Currently growing through growing pains as the company pushes through the start up mentality into a true, enterprise company. As such there's currently some understaffing in key areas which are in the process of being corrected. Long hours are common, but usually compensated for. Career tracks can vary, but there is room for growth upwards or laterally if desired. Best job, worst manager I honestly did not want to quit there even after winning multiple awards for sales and engineering . Splunk promotes people without feedback and creates an environment of that makes cliques and poor management an issue. A good place to work, Splunk was a good place to work, although beyond its core mission it had problems focusing on which opportunities to pursue. There is no ""typical day""; there are typical project cadences, which include planning up-front, then a development and testing cycle, and finally a deployment cycle. The best part of the job is the people; I enjoyed working with a lot of very bright people, and Splunk had those in spades. On the other hand, if you weren't in the core team, you were never working on anything particularly deep or challenging. Great place to work Splunk is one of those magic moments in your life where you pinch yourself and ask am I really working here? Ask any Splunker or ex-Splunker. I know it sounds cool and all to work at Splunk, but it really is truly cool. Everyone it seems is on a mission. You won't love everyone, and it isn't sudden Nirvana, but it gets pretty close. Relaxed Job, Great People As long as work got done, everyone was happy. My colleagues were passionate about their jobs and I learned a lot about the field as a result. The manager was relaxed and let me migrate to another office unless I was needed in meetings in order to shorten my morning commute. All around an amazing job and company that I would love to work at again in the future. Salary, Culture Long Drive Amazing Company, Amazing Product I had the opportunity to experience Splunk as both a customer and an employee. The products and the company is exceptional. I greatly enjoyed my time with the company. Excellent company with great products and devoted customer following This is a great company with great people in overall. Employees are committed to do the best. Fast pace environment. Great CEO who is passionate about growing the business and willing to try new things and admitting mistakes done if any. Free lunch and free breakfast once a week Growing fast and becoming a typical corporate culture with lots of politics Great Place to work Splunk is a great place to work with excellent leadership and an environment that is innovative. Splunk takes great care of their employees and creates a great work and home life balance. Splunk Family First The Splunk family grows on you and before you know it you will have to remind yourself to go home. The office setting comfortable. Splunk provides training! If Data analytic Big Data is your career path you have found a home. Splunkers are ninjas Your not gonna want to go home Amazing workplace Great place to work at. The environment is very friendly and affable, Professionalism meets innovation and creativity. Free meals, open workspaces, flexibility and amazing colleagues! Not what it once was Company sales culture has collapsed over the last few years. What was once a go win big culture in sales has turned into an over-managed metrics first, success second culture. If you're starting there now, you're likely not going to get the top accounts and will watch from the sidelines as others make the big W2's. Incredible place to Work and Great leadership Have never felt so much of a family at work and had people at the top who so deeply cared about the team. It was the best team feel and culture I have had the pleasure to work in. Food, Offices, People, Teams, Leadership Productive Fun Workplace A good place to work providing a lot of opportunities to learn. There is a focus on the career development of the individual and it's easy to provide your inputs even at a junior level. Great company and products Splunk is a great company with great benefits, culture, and products. Competitive salary. Everyone seems to be working to benefit Splunk customers. Growing quickly. Worked remotely None No comment No comment not worth my time talking about a company that is not racially diverse .. down with Splunk and all the greedy executives who sell stock keeping it low Une société au top! Chez Splunk, les salariés comme les clients sont des personnes qui vous tirent vers le haut. Je recommande à 100%. Company very high space, but professional atmosphere. I love it I enjoy working there as a temporary client. The employees worked hard, but the company really knows know who to take care of their employees too. They provide free breakfast and lunches. the Order team is great long hrs Great company unless you are stuck with a bad manager. Loved the company and culture. It was positive and supportive. Unfortunately, I got stuck with a new and inexperienced manager who wanted to hire her friends and less experience people. So I had to go. Great culture, good benefits. A bad manager can turn a great company to a bad job. 2 Good company Great Company to work for, They have great products, leading the industry. Benefits are comparable to other California based companies. Travel is high for the position, but that is Professional Services life. 1 No interest whatsoever in your career development If you get in to the right group you have died and gone to heaven. If you get the wrong manager who is only concerned with his own career, Throw your own future away. Good snacks Bad career help 8 3 No longer a start up Good company- Good product, 80% of job is forecasting and explaining where deals are. Very stressful QTR ends in that regard. Very little thought put into territory assignment and account coverage. An average seller could be making 400K while a star seller could struggle based on accounts assigned. If that gets fixed and they survive competitive landscape before they get acquired. not a bad place. good technology aggressive culture Smart people, good work-life balance I worked in legal, over a few summers as an intern. The people were all very competent and very much vested in both my wellbeing and my professional development even as an intern. Good company. If you are driven and willing to make the necessary move to advance your career; you will be successful within and outside this company. They give you a platform to control your own career. The hardest part of the job is that you are 100% remote. If you do not have a self starter mentality and need micro management this is not the company for you. The best of my job is helping my customers to be success and building their trust. I addition to doing the community service. Also, management at like real people and you can have open conversations. You don't have to worry about passive aggressive management. Working from home and the company has a great moral compass. Young copy and for see them making the same bad decisions like other big tech giants. Overall great place to work The company culture in this office was awesome. The teammates made you want to come to work in the morning and your direct managers were wonderful. There has been upper management changes lately though that -- we will see how it shakes out. compensation, coworkers, environment upper management changes Very stressful The job is very stressful you don't get a good compensation for the time that you invest on the job since a lot of time you have to take the work home to finish and don't get paid for that time. Taking into consideration that you get paid hourly and you only get paid for 8 hours a day very stressful Fun workplace that takes care of employees This is the best company I have ever worked for. They take care of people and it feels like family. You never have to be ashamed to ask questions. Splunk hires the best. Free food, commission, equity incentives, good compensation Excessive travel Decent place to work, depending on where you live While it is pretty impressive at HQ, remote employees (and there are a lot of them) tend to be forgotten. Management at Splunk is hit and miss as well. There is a lot of ""previous company nepotism"" for incoming managers. Many of the organizations have large swaths of people that have worked together at previous companies. While that's ok for easy relationship building, it also builds a clique that is difficult to work yourself into, especially if the team is spread out nationally or globally. As is normal with most companies, growth is Splunk's main focus. However, recently, that growth initiative has been met with releasing products that aren't ready, and forsaking many small customers for that BIG WIN. Like I said, this is common, but still something that is difficult to work in. Fun place to work with accepting people The people at Splunk are the reason I remember the experience so well. Everyone was very helpful and fun to work with, and when I didn't know the command I was supposed to use people were extremely helpful. Great environment to learn, and I had fun projects and a clear direction. Great office and atmosphere. Always involved with company gatherings. N/a good company met with customers to provide security and information technology solutions to meet the needs of higher education and state and local organizations. Fun work place Great place to work with friendly people. I had a great pay and flexible hours. I enjoyed my time working here and hope to find a company just as great. My experience at Splunk Splunk is a fantastic place to work. The work environment is very friendly and outgoing. I learned a ton from Splunk, such as many new computer skills and working with a team. I enjoyed my time at Splunk and hope to find a company just as great. Good environment Great technologie and great people. I have extensively work with many accounts and haven't had any customer complaints about the product. Fun workplace This was one of my favorite jobs that I ever got. Being said I worked as hard as I possibly could, knocking all tasks out of the park. I was promoted quickly but just as quickly I was fired. So far they have given no reason whatsoever. I believe there are a lot of office politics of which I never took part in. Free lunches and breakfast bad management who unsuccessful at managing large scale projects Productive and fun place to work in Splunk is a great place, as much as they love having fun, they know that when it comes to business it's time to get work done. Their environment is great for anyone who enjoys working. The company tried its best to have things such as, ping pong tables, drum sets, basketball courts and kitchens for their employees to take a break every now and then. Free lunch Mondays, and free Breakfast friday. 4 kitchens that is always stocked w/goodies No gym Work hard. Play Harder. This was a fun gig while it lasted. At times it was like working in a dorm with all the Nerf darts flying, loud music, empty beer glasses and colorful, happy-smiley people running around. Na Great product. This company is growing so fast. Co-workers where great to work with and had a lot of fun with them. Fun, organized, exciting place to work. The product is incredible and Splunk is leading the market. This motivates everyone to work hard and get excited to work hard on the product. Engineering is fairly agile and PMO seems to do a good job finding the best processes for the organization. Overall a very supportive environment. everyone is excited about the product, relaxed office environment, hard-working and intelligent people growing pains as the product and processes change quickly. Great company unless you are stuck with a bad manager. Loved the company and culture. It was positive and supportive. Unfortunately, I got stuck with a new and inexperienced manager who wanted to hire her friends and less experience people. So I had to go. Great culture, good benefits.

My career and life have been greatly enhanced since my employment here. I would highly recommend this company. Goal oriented and rewarding workplace BHG cultivates a competitive goal oriented workplace where hard work and dedication is rewarded, work life balance is promoted, and open dialogue and managerial support is exemplified. What Stands Out About BHG Financial I have never been a part of a place that strives for its employees to be so happy and so successful. The Motivation and Positive attitude are infectious. They want you to grow in and outside of the company. Core values sound great, but no one in leadership actually has these values They say they have a transparent, open door culture that supports you being your most authentic self. Maybe that’s true in other departments, but not at all the case in funding. Management is dismissive of your needs and does not care who you are as person, they barely take the trouble to get to know who they’re hiring and are quick to fire without cause if they decide they don’t like you after all-regardless of your actual work performance. If you actually get to use any of your earned time off, you will be shamed and possibly let go for doing so-especially if you happen to get sick and need to take a day off. That’s not ok here. Having an opinion or refusing to be disrespected is not ok here, but you better believe they will in fact repeatedly disrespect you while micromanaging and talking to you like you’re a child. If you have any self respect, do not waste your time here. Those in leadership are absolutely the most hypocritical and judgemental folks I’ve ever seen outside of church! Productive Workplace BHG Financial is a great place to work. Great benefits, while also having co-workers who are nice and helpful. I would recommend working at BHG. Good Benifits Positive Mental Attitude Onboarding and training process is one of the best of all the companies I've worked for. Management and the company wants to see every person succeed. Help and support is readily available and culture is very positive and motivating! Truly An Amazing Place to Work! From day 1 People Development sets you up for success! The training is extensive, comprehensive and should be the standard of the industry! Pay and benefits are top of the food chain! Great culture, amazing people to work with and work for! This job can change your life, I wake up with a smile ready to go to work everyday, that's the greatest compliment i can give any employer. Amazing work life balance, great benefits and overall great company culture I started at BHG Financial as an intern, and moved up into a full-time employee. The people and culture at BHG are amazing and you always feel welcomed. There is a huge emphasis on the work-life balance which really stood out to me. Overall, BHG is a great company filled with great people! work from home with incredible benefits as a new mom of twins i am so thankful for this incredible job! i get to work from home so i can drop off and pick up as needed. The benefits are amazing! the team is supportive and fun. no micro managing. its the energy of a start up with the stability of an established company all rolled into one! Almost a year in and so far it has been great! A typical day feels like working with friends solving good problems. I have learned quite a few new technologies that I had not used before and I'm learning a lot about finance, which I had not worked on before. I love my manager, he definitely pushes me out of my comfort zone but I'm learning a lot and I feel like he really cares about me and my future. The work culture is great and a big focus for the company since we had a lot of rapid growth over the 2 years. The hardest part of my job is probably finding time to do tedious work due to having a lot of meetings back to back, but I have been able to complete all my duties during regular work hours, its rare for me to have to put time outside of work. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work with. I can honestly say, these are the smartest people I have worked with. Company has a great outlook. good lovely place to work annnd i ennjoyed the people amongst other things like free food and whatnot and the management was good to deal with as well and locationn Career Advancement opportunities, Great Benefits, and Fully Remote BHG Financial honestly cares about it's employees and that is spread throughout the entire company (Top-down). You can feel that everyone is working together collectively to succeed instead of having an individualistic approach. The CEO and Co-Founder have allowed employees to work 100% remote throughout the last couple of years and have no plans to change this standard. The employee benefits are great with 3 weeks PTO, 100% covered Medical Premiums, and every 3rd Friday of the month off. Fully Remote, Matching 401k (6%), 100% covered Medical Premiums, Wellness Weekends (Once a month) Parental Leave Policy Great place to work From day one everyone has been beyond helpful and kind. It is a very fast paced work environment that keeps you on your toes. Very happy to work here and look forward to growing with the company. Supportive Team From the inception of onboarding to training your always supported and move at your own pace until your ready to go live with your role. They recently added a wellness day taken any time of the month for a mental break and relaxation. Worst job Only care about money, not you as an individual. No work life balance, expected to work 80 + hours a week. Will fire you fast for not making goal for just one month Grossly overpaid jerks If you like mandatory fun, and then being shunned because you dont want to watch hockey, this is the place for you. As long as you are related to someone, they will hire you, but they fire even faster. Best Career I've Had. I've held various jobs in my adult life including automotive sales/ management, hospitality, construction and even owned my own business for about 10 years. Hands down, BHG Financial is the best place I've ever worked. Amazing culture, benefits, leadership and pay! Compensation, benefits, on-site gym, free lunches, work from home options, leadership, opportunity for growth... I could keep going... None to speak of.

Great company PMA all Day I like working at BHG. The leadership at BHg is fantastic and managers are here to put you in a position to succeed. We are on the forefront of many innovative implantations. Great health care More award ceremonies Worst job I’ve ever had Benefits are literally the only reason to stay in this job. The hourly pay is not that great but you do get good commission. That is where the positives end. This job nearly made me sick from stress and exhaustion. They expect you to work every single day. It is the most toxic environment I have ever had the displeasure of being in. The stress levels are through the roof, they expect impossible numbers out of you. Like 8 people have left the funding department in the last 6 months, you don’t even want to know about the turnover in Sales Academy.. what does that tell you? Training is nothing more than one person that’s never available, mostly incompetent and tells you to utilize your coworkers and is generally not helpful at all. You are micromanaged to the point where your team lead is asking you how come you didn’t send an email faster, you’re asked on every single task if you completed it or not, it is absurd. God forbid you run to the restroom and don’t immediately message someone back within 2 mins, your team lead will call you hunting you down. Then there’s the part where you have to ask your team for permission to take vacation days, and then when you put the time in the supervisor gets salty like they don’t want you to take your time off that you’re given lol. Ridiculous! They do give you free therapy sessions, and you will need them to deal with the toxicity and stress. Lol RUN don’t walk away. Company that is very invested in their employees in multiple ways. Fast paced, coworkers across all teams are wonderful, adequate training. Enough work to keep you busy so there isn't any down time on your end. I would highly recommend BHG to anyone looking for a place to work. Account Executive Role I left the cable company after 20 yrs of service. I was skeptical of leaving, boy am I glad I did. The culture here is second to none. People share common goals and are willing to help even off hours or on weekends. The benefits are fantastic, free health care for self or really cheap for family. They are top notch too. Company wide memorandum came out, 3rd Friday of every month we have off PAID. The job itself is not easy, but the hours logged are well worth it. Sales agents are highly compensated. Benefits, Teamwork, Morale N/a Could not be any happier! I have just completed sale academy and absolutely Love working for BHG. The culture is amazing, I have never experienced a company like this! The last 3.5 months have flown by and the best part is Mondays don't feel like Mondays. I enjoy helping clients and hearing the joy in their voice when they know they're able to achieve their financial goals! Come hungry and put the hours in and you will not be disappointed. CULTURE!!!!! great pay and benefits.. everything N/a Amazing company to be a part of! The company really cares about their employees and has lots of services to support them. Work life balance and healthy lifestyle. No cons found yet by me. Excellent work environment for growth and opportunity If you are looking for growth and opportunity, BHG is the right place. It has a good blend of new technology services and projects and a bunch of smart / talented folks who are keen to move the business forward. Gym, Stress management, life coaching, employee recognition. Work can be busy at times. Need to find ways to de-stress and plan I’ve never worked at a place that’s so involved with their employees without micromanaging. Every step of the process from interviewing to training in my position was very smooth. Every detail of my job was described and taught to me in detail. I was walked through every responsibility with the learning and development team and that continued with my current management team as I settled into my position. The manager team really wants you to succeed and does anything they can to make sure that happens. -Catering breakfast/lunches/events, Overtime, Free healthcare, Casual dress, All supplies needed for the job is given to you, Great co- workers - I haven’t run into anything yet! This is far & away the best place I have ever worked! Every single person should be able to experience the BHG culture, & be part of the BHG family! This is far & away the best place ever! Every single person should be able to experience the BHG culture, & to be part of the BHG family! I cannot imagine ever going anywhere else. Health insurance from Day One, free lunches, free snacks, free gym, free car washes, free food trucks! Absolutely none - BHG is the best!! This company truly puts employees first I have been working here for 10 months, and came from two very large corporations prior to joining Banker's Healthcare group. I am amazed every day at how fairly and honestly this company treats its employees, and they truly do put the employee experience first. There are perks for those who wish to head into the office (onsite gym, food trucks) and yet they fully embrace the idea of a remote workplace for those who wish to stay at home. Their benefits package is amazing as well, and for a small, privately owned company, they do return a large portion of earnings back to the people who help them succeed. They trust you to get your work done, and you are 100% responsible to see that it is. If you are an exceptional worker, and tend to go above and beyond what is expected, you are rewarded. This is not a company recommended for those who need to be micro-managed to get their work done. My teams are consummate professionals who know how to have fun, and who care about and respect each other. I am extremely grateful that I was offered this position, and that I chose to accept. team building events, excellent healthcare, 401k matching, monthly awards ceremonies Great work environment and very supportive team This team has been and continues to be supportive, resourceful and full of optimism. Tasks are placed fairly and if needed, deadlines can be adjusted. Great team dynamics, benefits and inclusiveness Beginning PD schedule was very tight on time with many things happening. Entrepreneurial, engaging and positive environment BHG is a truly unique company that I am incredibly grateful to work for. The founders are entrepreneurs that built BHG from the ground up and have turned it into one of the fastest growing companies in the FinTech space. Every one at BHG is willing to help you and support you. If you make a mistake, you are protected by your co-workers instead of being thrown to the wolves like most corporate environments. It is a really incredible organization and although not all teams within the company are the same, the vision and leadership from the top continues to shape both individual contributors and teams alike. Excellent leadership, out of workplace benefits (concerts, food trucks, sports) Better perks for those living near an office Excellent Employer Here at BHG I feel like my opinion really matters and I can make a change! There are so many opportunities available and I couldn’t be happier working here! Opportunity for those willing to work Fast paced entrepreneurial work environment. Opportunity at this growing organization is more in your hands than larger companies. Your hard work, dedication and growth as a person and professional will be recognized IF you are willing to go the extra mile. In a company like BHG where goals are aggressive and growth projections are steep, the extra mile becomes an expectation, if you don't mind working hard to get rewarded than this company will have no ceiling for you. Compensation, 100% paid Healthcare Premiums, Flexible work environment, Opportunities for growth great Overall a great company to work with a lot of great people. Everyone is super helpful and will never turn their back when you need help. A great financial product Read Before Applying If you are interested in joining ""sales academy"" do not do it. It is a disorganized mess and it is nothing but a constant headache. You are nothing but a number to them and do not get to know you at all. They will hype you up like you are so great, then fire you like you did not work for them for 90 days. The company is going downhill fast, stay away. Wfh Lied about hours, they want you to work M-Sun 24/7, constant mind games, no transparency, they do not hire leaders, they hire managers who have big egos Potential to make A LOT of money, but at a cost Overall BHG takes care of their employees, always finding ways to help with fantastic benefits and company culture. However, they will work you till your sick. I'm not exaggerating this is a Mon-Sun job. Leads are on a 24/7 rotator and if you don't engage within 2 hours your managers will be notified. You can change your life with the income potential but it will come at a major cost. NO work life balance whatsoever. Pay, Culture, Free healthcare, great support NO work life balance whatsoever Non-Productive, Clicky atmosphere My time there was not spent seeing the company’s motto “PMA” positive mental attitude. Extremely negative team, extremely negative and clicky atmosphere. Worst job I have ever had. Worst manager I have ever had. Definitely apply to work here if you want to be managed by people who are bosses and not leaders. Freedom Management Fun environment and challenging work! Management is supportive and caring! Love the environment with team working toward the same common goal (getting the job done efficiently and effectively). Lots of perks and extra time off. Excellent benefits. We truly appreciate you taking the time to leave a review of BHG.

The key to our success over the years has truly been our commitment to our hard-working team. We’re proud of our culture and it’s great to hear your thriving with us. Thanks for reviewing us! Great opportunities for those who put in the work When it comes to being a great employer, BHG checks all the boxes. The company and its ownership deliver not only on what's expected in today's job market, but go above and beyond to always find new ways to give back to their employees. - The people are great. Every employee I've worked with in my 5+ years has been kind, eager to help, and a pleasure to work with. I can trust the people who work here. - Competitive benefits including a 100% covered healthcare premium plan. When the offices are open, employees have access to on-site gyms with personal trainers. - One of a kind workplace culture. It's fast-paced, collaborative, and driven by innovation. Leaders and management always encourage employees to bring new ideas to the table. You will be listened to and recognized for great work. - BHG's COVID response was amazing. The company went 100% remote for the first time in March 2020 and more than a year later is offering employees the option to continue doing so. Many employees were even able to relocate because of this added flexibility. BHG also offered employees $1000 to spend to renovate their new home offices. - Be prepared to work. BHG moves at light speed and is always changing and developing its products or procedures. Putting in 110% is necessary for those who want to rise through the company. While hours may be long, the company does emphasize taking rest and recovery. In the monthly state of the company meetings, the co-founders directly emphasize the importance of taking time to log off, especially when remote. There is also a generous amount of PTO to use. Endless opportunities for growth, great benefits (100% healthcare coverage), fast-paced environment, fun workplace culture The fast-paced work environment may not be for everyone 6 1 Family like environment with great income potential There is a lot of work to do, but the opportunity is there to really build financial freedom. You are not required to work later, or weekends but your performance and income will suffer if you don’t work hard. On the bright side you are not micro managed and when I say financial freedom I’m not exaggerating. Hard work equals big pay and there is a support system. We are like family here. Flex schedule, gym, healthcare covered at 100% and unlimited income potential as well as growth A lot of work. Not for anyone who wants a 9-4 1 Good place to work Good place to work. Few cons are that it can be a little cliquey but nothing a professional cannot handle. They do care about their employees but will do whatever they have to do for the company's best interest. Pay Not much honestly Complaints not taken seriously Had an issue with another employee I tried to address. To no avail. Fell on deaf ears. Always got told our doors are always open but won't listen. Very much a team environment but don't like to fix problems they just fire you. Worked there for over 2 years and felt like I didn't matter free healthcare open door policies only for some Management seems to have a lot of favoritism which overshadows certain individuals that may not be as well known in such a big company. Management seems to have a lot of favoritism which overshadows certain individuals that may not be as well known in such a big company. Be clear during the hiring process to not make too many promises to new hires. Best Place I’ve Ever Worked Been working since the late 90’s and this is the first job to surprise me from day 1. They really put a lot of time and effort in making their employees very happy. Lots of unexpected bonuses and room to grow. Great company and great management!!! Productive work place with an onsite gym Productive work place with an onsite gym. You learn about working with business owners and the cycle of a loan process.The onsite gym also has a personal trainer and chef to with your work life balance. Great place to work! If you are a hard worker, this job will pay off. The lifestyle is very fun and the people are all very nice. They make sure you hit your numbers and make sure you are compensated correctly. They have plenty of team building events and ways to keep you happy. Good Management Great culture and workplace. Leadership tries to develop and promote from within. Growing company with a lot of future potential and job growth and development. easy going atmosphere The position itself is not hard. Helping clients is the easier part its when the client isnt interested and management wants you to still sell them a loan. great people upper management Positive Experience I had a very positive experience working at BHG. There were many pros and management was extremely willing to help people learn and grow as individuals. I would recommend working here. BHG - keeping up the #PMA My time at BHG has been so refreshing - refreshing to know that there are employers who truly care about their people and who are willing and able to supply them with the resources and training necessary to not just fulfill job requirements, but to exceed them in every way! The culture here is also something very unique - with the casual dress code and the encouragement to utilize the onsite gym during the day to relieve some stress, it is one that cultivates collaboration and team work - we are always pushing for our goals together, with a constant focus on keeping a positive mental attitude! onsite gym w/ personal trainer; monthly awards w/ catered lunches; corporate volunteer opportunities High Pressure, Productive, Results Driven Sales Organization BHG is a great place to work. From the Executive level down to the middle management level, everyone is super positive and driven to succeed. I would definitely recommend this company to anyone looking to advance their career in finance sales great commission structure, bonuses, culture, work environement none Great place to work The workplace is a great place.

This is a good company to work at Beautiful building - many perks Bankers HealthCare Group started out small and has grown tremendously in the last 5 years and is still growing with an article that came out just this week that there will be an additional 200 jobs in the next few years. Gym Good place to start For anyone interested in sales, or financial services this is a good place to start your career, the lessons learned here you will find invaluable, both in how to practice your trade, and in how the business world really works.

Overall experince They management are young and don't understand how to manage was fired base on lies. They keep people employed if you're a friend. Not a company good company to work for if your in sales. The company has a gym Mangers don't know how to manage 14 1 I’m disheartened to read your review, and I’d like the opportunity to address your comments. Letting people go is one of the hardest things any manager has to do, and I’m sorry that employment didn’t work out. Please know that we take protocol seriously and will look into this particular situation. I agree that we do have some young managers, but we strive to hire people who are qualified, capable and embrace our environment of being a team player. Managers go through thorough onboarding and are evaluated annually. Additionally, we offer training to all employees to help them improve their professional skills, no matter their title. We work hard to create a great place to work and to have a culture in which employees thrive in all departments and feel empowered to have open, honest communication. Please feel free to contact me directly if you’d like to discuss your situation more: eroman@bhg-inc.com. Great Company The company provides you an opportunity to learn, grow and expand in to any opportunity you commit yourself to. If you're interested in a company that compensates you for hard work, BHG is a good fit. Great benefits, family environment and a productive atmosphere. The training department assures you not only learn your role, but that you understand the company as a whole and how every position contributes to the end result. If you're willing to put your head down and diligently do your work, you'll never want to leave this company. 3 4 Great Culture Company has a very positive attitude and very caring toward the employees. Ownership is hands on and always looking for ways to help and motivate the associates. Great perks like a gym on site, personal trainer, café, team building activities, and occasional free lunches. Advancement opportunities! Great atmostphere! Great Perks! Growning to fast! But I guess thats a positive thing. team approach well balanced gym on site and personal chef great rewards lots of team activity many outside functions open floor plan working with each dept never a dull moment many perks high intensity Nice Culture Bankers Healthcare Group provides a unique culture with a fast paced environment. It is a competitive role that allows you to earn as much as you would like. You are permitted to dress down and your opinion is valued. Cool Culture Many job changes competitive sales environment Great culture, always helping employees improve. Your day is non-stop, heavy phone traffic while maintaining your pipeline to be able to hit your goals on a monthly basis. Great Workplace Great place to work. They care for their employees and provide ample benefits to those who are willing to work. They also aknowledge the efforts that everyone puts in Growing company that pays well BHG is a great, fun place to work. The teams spend time together and build relationships. Supervisors are always there to help. It is a great, busy work environment to work in. The pay is also very good. Productive work place with an employee's cafe and employee's gym. I always enjoy working at Bankers Healthcare Group or any other company I have worked in my life. I'm a people person, willing to help anybody and do anything to get the job done. I'm very quiet when I work, I concentrate very hard so I don't make any mistakes. I have learned in this company a new program called Buildium, a tenant software for leases and contracts to rent properties. Bankers Healthcare Group is a multi cultural company, people from different background and religion. There was nothing hard about my job, it was very enjoyable to go into work every morning. Cafe on site None Great company to work for. very fast pace Amazing company. Always room for advancement if you show your dedicated and have a good attitude. Very fast pace and constantly changing with the market. Free lunches, free gym and personal trainer none Sales Support Specialist • Manage sales team pipelines including acquiring documentation from clients to properly structure applications. • Created clients files and conducted background research to validate client-supplied credentials and financial data. • Analyze client tax returns and income verification documents. • Liaise between Customer Support Department and sales team to successfully close loans. • Schedule prospect interviews and discovery discussions for sales and underwriters leading to closing I learned a lot about the financial aspect of the health industry, I enjoyed helping health professionals be able to expand their careers and practices by assisting in getting loans. Hardest part of the job was executing every avenue and not being able to qualify a potential customer to receive our products. Most enjoyable part of the job was the positive environment and working with people who care. fast paced, assisting in helping clients benefit their life, friendly environment, positive morale, learn about all aspects of business unrealistic expectations Sales is not what they promise No work/life balance. Pulling 12 hour days and you're still looked at as a slacker. Leads are manipulated so that new reps are never given leads that will fund. Lots of company politics. Good Place to Work Great Work Environment. I left because I am relocating out of area. Very nice people. Professional caring group. Good management Work Environment Low Pay Unique Sales & Marketing Company BHG is the premier provider of financing solutions for healthcare professionals nation wide. It offers funding for commercial purposes with the speed and efficiency that healthcare professionals expect. Since my past experiences have been developing a personal interaction with my client, I learned how to sell by phone and originate finance requests quickly. I enjoy working with all of my co-workers and teammates. I discovered the importance of not only working together but also helping each other. I enjoy the work but miss the person to person sales and lending environment. Team Environment Growing Pains Productive , fun team player atmosphere for the most part I truly enjoyed working at Bankers Healthcare Group. It definitely was a great experience. Very fast paced, motivated and challenging at times in a positive way. Owners are one of a kind, very appreciative and they value their employees for the most part. The management does need a little work and training. I feel the owners/upper management should screen the candidates a little more thoroughly prior to moving them into a managerial position. Motivation meetings everyday, appreciation, values. Management in some areas Bhg Great place to work. I have always found Bankers Healthcare Group to be a very caring organization. They promote a healthy work environment. Atmosphere Nothing Gross lack of leadership and collaboration - BHG should have a revolving door on the office as people either quit or resign at a breakneck pace. There is no training or support and the culture there is horrible. New employees are expected to train themselves and questions are met with angry reprisal. I've never had a negative work experience but I can say that I have had my first at BHG. Run, don't walk, when the recruiters call. Free lunches on Friday, good compensation Small company that's run by a small group that frowns on new people/ideas, no training or support Very very Unprofessional!!! I applied for a job at the office in Syracuse. They told me they would make a decision by the end of the week. I called for two weeks!!! She said she would let me know when she knew. I called again after two weeks, my phone calls were ignored all day long, i called 3 times At 5 when they leave for the day she emailed me and said they went with somebody else. If i had not called i wpuld have never recieved an email back. They are extremely unprofessional and I am very very happy I was not hired to work for such cowards!!!! HR/Management Alright place to work It has its amenities like a gym and personal trainer as well as a cafe with a chef for lunch but as far as longevity and career wise i would look elsewhere. Very productive and great enviorment to work in Answering phones and transferring all calls to proper person or office. Doing spreadsheets for the owners. Keeping track of all mailers. Shipping all packages. Typing up all proposals for doctor's to review before signing contract. Doing what was asked to do by HR or owner's of company. Management was great. Very caring and understanding. Always willing to work with you. My co-workers were great. We all worked as a team. The hardest part of the job was moving up in the company. The most enjoyable part was working with great people and a fun atmosphere. Healthcare benifits Fun environment and challenging work! Management is supportive and caring! Love the environment with team working toward the same common goal (getting the job done efficiently and effectively). Lots of perks and extra time off. Excellent benefits.

Garmin International, Inc.|" Consistently put out great products Garmin continues to put out fantastic, quality, cutting edge products. This is an engineering company, and as such, they under value other areas. In particular SALES! Chaotic management, declining innovation Culture is moving towards time tracking of every minute and micro-management. Mid-level managers are more career focuses than product focused and often set unrealistic deadlines and goals. Often fickle, they never know what they want and will throw entire redesigns into the pipeline while maintaining previous deadlines. Response to impending deadlines has been 6 months of ""suggested, but not mandatory"" PTO which is held against you if you don't work the extra hours. Pto, 401k match Forced PTO to meet unrealistic deadlines Great company to work for if you are looking for stability! PRO-Great job stability and benefits! The benefits are top notch for sure. Awesome culture and teams. CONS-If you are looking for a high salary and fast career progression, this is not your place though. You will need lots of patience to achieve both. Benefits Salary Disappointing Experience I was enthusiastic at first but within a few months that quickly faded. It seems as if I only supposed to talk over the in office messenger while being required to go into the office. Time was regimented to the minute and you would be punished for leaving even a minute early despite staying late the previous day and putting in OT. Coworkers seemed bothered by any sort of questions or collaboration whilst working on the same project. Pay was average at best but little room for advancement. Never felt welcomed or belonging for a job I had a passion and knowledge for. My input was always looked over and never felt appreciated as a worker. lots of PTO, good tuition reimbursement, good 401K match outdated management style and corporate attitude, little room to advance Company on decline Once it used to be very good employer , now I see the values are on decline. People only those who are close to manager are getting promoted.Toxic middle management. Projects are in red status even before the start. Job security Salary, on call rotation for developers Positive workplace without micromanaging Great place to work. Positive people, good training, associates are all levels are kept in the loop. Cons are pay doesn't increase fast enough or match experience. Too many leaders involved on projects, makes decisions drawn out and compromised. You're Either Stuck or Not There is a very clear bias that comes from management. They will never be there to see you pull your weight let alone carrying anyone elses on your team. So meeting and/or exceeding expectations is pointless. But always seem to be there to reprimand you on trivial issues. They are unaware of talent right in front of their faces because they spend majority of their time and their offices or wasting important decision making time to run their mouths. There's a clear disconnect between the values they expect from their employees versus what they show. There's no point in trying to move forward if they only look for external hires. Some of the employees who do get the opportunity to move forward aren't always good ones because not one is actually vetting them based on work ethic and accuracy. Great place to work maternity leave is 10 days at Garmin. After that, you have to use your accrued PTO (which rolls over each year if you have any unused.) If you run out of PTO, you have to go on short-term disability. For a company with such great benefits like health care and 401k matching, I cannot believe maternity leave is 10 days. Also, negotiate your signing bonus, they will always give you more. 401k matching, great culture, great employees maternity leave Typical call center so I am told The training is long and tedious. They overburdened you with information. There is a help desk so that's cool. Your manager is just there to make sure you're doing your job. They don't really offer any support unless you're not meeting your criteria then they're up your butt with support, just not the good kind. If you like being stuck in a cubicle and talking to people about devices that are breaking, with rules that are unclear. times that are very rigid but you can talk to the customers as long as you want; This is the job for you. I hated it. Modest Company w/ odd quirks Great work-life balance & corporate culture, but it can be ruined by a bad manager (was for me). Also, the culture in the Aviation division was pretty subpar compared to the fitness/marine side. I really enjoyed my time, but was always looking over the fence to the fitness people and the better culture, hires & general environment over there. Good activities, great people Aviation doesn't have the same culture as the rest of the company Vertically integrated so management has experiance I get in early so I can begin working on problems or issues that may need attention on the factory floor. We test 24/5 so I like to get an early start and touch base with all 3 shifts. Get people and fun place to work. Awesome people to work with. Best company I have worked for ever. None really Employee share of benefits is awesome. Support from leadership team is also great (open door atmosphere). I was forced to leave by medical reasons. Otherwise, I would have still worked there. The leadership team was very accommodating but I ultimately had to leave my position. Great employee discounts. Monthly rewards for members of each team (free lunch, gift cards, etc). The do get in the way of your personal life, scheduled in a way that really do not allow you to complete daytime chores. Management and workplace culture Micromanaging is horrible at Garmin, everything from being questioned about bathroom breaks to selective discipline for talking to coworkers. There is definitely a lot of favoritism regarding who gets written up for workplace activity, to who does or doesn't get an opportunity to move or advance within the company. Garmin is all about profit with little regard for the people who work hard to allow the company to be profitable. You might get a 2-4% raise if you're lucky. You are more likely to be denied a raise or the chance to apply for different positions in this punitive environment. HR write ups, a point system that is often unfair and inconsistent (i.e. again based on favoritism) and even simply applying for other internal positions can limit or prevent these opportunities. Overall a negative work environment. Garmin only cares about Garmin. Garmin only cares about Garmin. No appreciation for workers. Different departments run by different rules. Absolutely no communication. Only good thing is benefits. Benefits are pretty good Management is terrible, HR is worse, no appreciation for workers Facilities Not the place or Me. Micro Management Your looked at as Housekeeping not a Tech. Zero Training to grow The culture is hire and replace when the quite not to keep and grow Employees 4 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Vibrant culture, feelings that we contribute to the project What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Low compensation compared to other well-known companies Less opportunities to grow Worked for Garmin in the past and absolutely loved working there! Great, and highly intelligent and motivate teammates. Good culture. Amazing products. I wouldn't have left the company if Tucson hadn't proven to be such an undesirable place for my partner and I to live. I loved going into work and truly miss some of my coworkers there. Great people and great products Garmin is an engineering driven company. Many small teams working on a variety of great products. No politics. Associates are ranked for 3 areas, performance, service and values. This leads to great people working together to accomplish great things. Great place to work! Garmin is a fantastic company that encourages internal advancement. Great place to start a career. Management does everything they can to facilitate your success and development Solid working environment Although the direct salary pay is arguably under-market, you will rarely if ever be expected to work more than 40-45 hours in the Chanhassen office. The benefits are fantastic, and have easily saved my family tens of thousands of dollars over the 6 years I worked there. Specialized and challenging but rewarding Garmin is a great company and in the aviation piece of it are challenges and tough projects. Overall, the learning capabilites exist and they strive for constant improvement. Aviation background is a must and technical skills go a long way, but at the end of the day it's pretty terrific. ESSOP and 401K are excellent benefits Consistently put out great products Garmin continues to put out fantastic, quality, cutting edge products. This is an engineering company, and as such, they under value other areas. In particular SALES! Good place to work with supportive environment Decent pay with benefits. Work is challenging, but not over stressful. Supportive team to help one another resolve blocking issues. Periodic team building event. Good company Garmin is a good place to work. The people are good and nice The benefits are great They make you feel included The job is simple but different enough at times where you won't get burnt out doing the same thing on repeat. However the issue I have is that managers don't seem that important. I say this because before they can do anything they have to check with engineers who probably never even stepped in and did the job of another department to actually know how to properly do something. Like you can't say one way would be better just because you put some numbers together and it works you have to actually step in and do the job and learn from it. The other issue which is a big one is that even though Garmin has amazing benefits. They brag about it and say they care about employees and tell you about how great the company as a whole is doing, yet here a lot of us are struggling to get by and having to worry about paying a bill on time because Garmin continues to pay below a comfortable living wage. While one of their suppliers pays more and has better hours than we do even other companies in the area pay more than Garmin does. I'm struggling but they don't care. People and Benefits Pay and Engineers 2 Garmin is a stepping stone Don't expect much from this place. The pay is not great. I think it might be the lowest in the industry. It's really only best served for padding your resume. You will not feel valued for individual expertise. You will often feel out of the loop with end goal metrics. Company culture is good, Underpay Company culture , benefits and Management are really Good. 401k and Medical benefits are excellent. Employee discount 45% Compensation is not upto Market Standards . Great Benefits, Great Culture, Mediocre Executives Garmin's been around for a long time, and will probably continue to be so; plus for stability. Engineering experiences will be different between segments, but high stress is to be expected. As a whole, the company cares about workplace ethics, safety, and compliance. Upper management, however, values only the bottom dollar and shareholders. After the largest ransomware payout in US history, cyber security measures were knee-jerk reactions and overly restrictive; common sense industry-wide security standards are routinely ignored in favor of having an open LAN. Without a CIO, Engineering department heads are left to fight with IT heads over security practices and endpoint protection. Free coffee, Great benefits, Collaborative atmosphere, Job stability Draconian security policies, Forced use of personal smartphone, Unforgiving legal/HR policies, Everything is a mountain of band-aids Great Company with below industry compensation Great Company but the compensation is below industry standard. As a result I and many others on my team are starting a job search elsewhere to get the compensation we deserve. Productive and fun place to work This company could do a lot more with diversity and inclusion in upper management. Work is easy, training is comprehensive but the pay should be better for the manufacturing workers. great people to work with No schedule flexibility for manufacturing workers Good overall company Good company for you and lots of job opportunities. Company is always leading the market in all of its product categories. Good customer support. Great benefits for employees. Job security Some Supervisors dont have tactfullness Laid back management, good benefits, low compensation, I've worked at Garmin in the warehouse for over 9 years. I've stayed mainly because of the stable Monday - Friday schedule and the benefits package. The wage is fairly low for the warehouse sector, but the laid back management attitude is nice. It is difficult to advance in Garmin with out a college degree, especially if you want to move out of the warehouse. The basic lob functions within the warehouse are very easy and require little training, the people who step up to do the more advanced functions receive little to nothing for their effort, just the hope of a good annual review. Advancing in the warehouse, has little to do with your work output and more with "" fitting in "" with the clique. laid back management, stable schedule, good benefits low pay, dead end job w/out college or ""fitting in"" Headquarters in the center of the universe Garmin has a great culture and most employees are passionate about the products they develop and gravitate to a segment that meets their interests. While Garmin is a global company, they do a poor job of integrating sites and ensuring they feel part of the Garmin family. For Garmin engineers who work at sites outside of HQ or North America struggle to feel that their voices are heard when it comes to innovation or working on projects/products that are new. Outdoor active lifestyle and play with the products you create. Leadership is stagnent, a bit inbred and passive toward organizational change and decision making. Free Mask Some work their tails off, others gets to stay on their phone....others get to set in a chair and visit other lazy employees while the workers are caring their load, just depends who you are ... Definitely the Company takes advantage of the hard workers. Brings down morale Free masks, but only 1 day But try to wear it more than one day if all possible Not a high paying job at all, the ones they like get the better raise 2% if your lucky Great People, Great Environment. Pay not competitive enough. The job is fairly easy, sometimes it can be stressful when there is a lot on your plate and overtime is required. The pay is unfortunately low and it's hard to tell how to advance in the company. Overtime is unpaid at the moment but changes are being made to accommodate that which is good. The people at the company are really kind, friendly, and personable, possibly one of the best benefits of the job. The benefits GARMIN provides are really good too. Overall a good place to work however career growth for the long term is uncertain. Benefits, People, Flexibility Low pay, high turnover, no room for advancement Warehouse bld 5 is terrible Management is the worst I've ever seen. The work is fairly easy but the environment is awful. Only the people who have been with the company for over 10 years are comfortable. New people are not welcomed. No advancement opportunities. Loved the work week hours and benefits, but not work the mental exhaustion working with those people. Pay is mediocre at best, barely comparable to all the other warehouses in the area. A huge disappointment. Work at your own risk. Benefits, no weekends or holidays, easy work Management, no growth, toxic environment Love my job! I’ve been with Garmin for awhile and I absolutely love it. While it’s hard to find a place of employment where you absolutely love I have found one here. Benefits None Extremely stable and amazing benefits The benefits package is unreal. 5% 401k with no employee contribution. Then a 75% match up to 12.5% of your income. I haven't found a company that will do that other than Garmin. The leadership truly cares and are really good people. This is an amazing family company and has unparalleled stability. The only bad parts are the pay and the career progression. I'm highly skilled in my are of expertise and my base is just over $40k. The issue is that I'm skilled in the product market sector, but I do not have an engineering degree. Without an engineering degree, everything goes slower for you. 401k and Healthcare Pay and Career potential for non-engineer associates Culture and work-life balance makes me stay here Respectful and collaborative culture, excellent work-life balance, great benefits, ability to move around within the company to other teams. People are generally smart, passionate and humble. Most people put the company’s interests above their own. It’s a large company but sometimes still operates like a startup. It’s changing though. Cafeteria, on-site gym Sometimes feels too conservative Amazing work culture, awesome benefits, decent pay Garmin has earned its reputation not only in the industries that it serves but also in the market by respecting its employees. Garmin is one of the companies that take care of their employees very well. If you look up the company benefits, I'm sure it would beat almost every company out there. Amazing 401k match, health insurance options, ESPP plans, discounts on Garmin products, etc. They also have lucrative employee retention benefits as well. People are great here and always available for help. The company is 32 years old, not open to many changes, and does not take high risks when it comes to doing business. The only downside is the location and the pay. Garmin is not known to pay its employees a high base salary. The pay is sometimes at average or a bit below average. The bonus is a joke as well but overall, if you combine all the benefits, it's worth working for Garmin! Fortune 500, Work Culture is great, Flexibility, different segments to work for, 401k match, health insurance options, ESPP plans, discounts on Garmin products Base salary is low, bonus is a joke, not open to changes, undervalues candidacy, less growth opportunities Fast-paced workdays with lots of multitasking. Co-workers and frontline supervisors are very supportive. Just the fact that my commute is only 2 minutes without having to jump into the highway, is one of the biggest benefit I get from working at Garmin. Excellent precautions re COVID-19. Great culture Garmin has great benefits and culture. Great company to be a part of. There are great people at every level of the company. You are treated as a valued asset. Non competitive pay Decent benefits, pays lip-service to work/life balance. At the end of the day though, they act like a corporation. People tend to be friendly at Garmin. You get decent benefits (health insurance, dental, vision, 401(k), onsite fitness facilities). Bonuses are pretty standard and rigid with everyone generally getting the same amount regardless of tenure, performance, company profits, etc. - on average throughout my 17+ years there, we'd almost always get $200-$300 as our bonus at the end of the year. The company seems loathe to actually give associates monetary perks, opting as much as possible for little gestures like a ""celebration"" for campus expansion, local sports teams doing well, etc. where you get a speech from the CEO and a cupcake or something along those lines. It's nice, and non-monetary compensation definitely has a place, but Garmin leans heavily on it. I worked at Garmin for 17+ years, starting out in the entry-level position in Cartography (which requires a college degree), then being promoted up to where I eventually ended up as a Team Leader. Yet despite being there that long and being promoted multiple times, having numerous additional responsibilities, losing other Team Leaders (and having to take on additional team members and duties as a result), having to sacrifice personal time, consistently being under stress, etc., when I left employment there, I was still making less than an entry-level software engineer - I was paid in the $60K-$65K range. ""Hard work"" to my particular former manager meant putting work first at all times, and if you're going through tough personal times, that's just tough - you need to suck it up and do your work. And I actually did this for Benefits (insurance, 401(k), on-site fitness facilities), people Salary, work/life balance, schedule flexibility/remote work possibility, my former boss in particular Consistently put out great products Garmin continues to put out fantastic, quality, cutting edge products. This is an engineering company, and as such, they under value other areas. In particular SALES! Busy work environment but many good benefits. This is a good place to work if you like to stay busy! High workload at times can make the days a little stressful, but thats expected in a warehouse/shipping environment that ships nationally. 2 Great work life balance, but the work itself is bad As an engineer, I really like Garmin overall. The work life balance is great, and I think management tries to do the right thing in most cases. But at least locally, the work itself sucks and they don't seem able to get you into work that's fulfilling. Working in non-HQ offices is problematic too. For particular projects that are spread across offices, HQ doesn't really help satellite offices get the hardware resources or knowledge needed. Working at HQ is much more effective because there is a lot of tribal engineering knowledge and other offices don't get the same amount of support. Work-life balance Work itself isn't good, support at satellite offices is problematic 3 Good benefits stressful work Garmin is a stressful work environment with high pressure in the billing department. The training and support can sometimes be lacking. The benefits are very good in the pay is somewhat good for the work expected Lunch and incentives frequently High pressure and stress Work work work The salary is low for a tech company. The raise/bonus is NOT based on your performance or the company. The pay raises are below standard. Advancement is base on your direct manager's perception. The work is challenging and there is lots of it. work/family life balance, stock option, health benefit low salary, advancement Great benefits but low wages A typical day in Software Quality is comprised of a Jira board full of tickets that needed validation yesterday and attending meetings.The work load is typically heavy and you will be expected to verify and produce a minimum amount of defects each sprint or be reprimanded.Management does not provide much in the way of coaching in order to attain pay raises or promotions.There is a perception of preferential treatment that has never been dealt with. Wages are quite low even after factoring in location and the great benefits that are provided. The Garmin workplace culture as a whole can be fun and there are many ways to stay physically active.The most enjoyable parts of the job are great co-workers and fun products to work on. Great benefits and fun products to work on Depressed wages and no incentive for team work Company has changed Garmin used to be a family business and as such it was a pleasure to give it your all because you knew others had your back. As it grew however, more emphasis was put on profits and less on people. There are little to no advancement opportunities or a plan to get you to that next level and aggressive managers are eager to cull employees they feel do not agree or get along with them without warning. Highly encourage physical fitness, good pay and benefits Some managers are egotistical and self serving Alright pay, Good hours, Good culture pay can be better good coworkers, good management good benefits, holiday off, vacation time, best part is job isn't too bad to do. its pretty easy once you learn how to do it. Good work/life balance, terrible growth opportunity unless your are an Engineer If you're an Engineer, this is the place for you. Unfortunately I'm not an engineer. There is very little growth opportunity without and engineering degree. The pay is extremely low for the area. There is a fairly robust benefits package but unfortunately I cannot pay my mortgage and bills with them. Vacation, hours, overall work/life balance Very low pay Good Company Garmin is a good company to work at. They really help you can make sure you grasp and understand what is going on. They give employees the time of day and allow them to learn at their own pace . Laid back work environment with easy to get along with staff Laid back work place with casual dress code. Great benefits and good money. The supervisors are easy to work and will work for shift deviations of something comes up and you need time off. free lunch from time to time none Company is great Company as a whole is awesome. Management could use some work. Great benefit, 401k, stock option, awesome health insurance. Devices are great. Great bennies my days are rarely the same, something different or new all the time. There is always more to do than time to get it done. Focus on healthy living, work life balance Orientation If You’re Hired On For The Warehouse Is Very Misleading A lot Of Smoke And Mirrors So basically day one you set through an orientation and take a tour of the building you won’t ever go to this orientation is directly directed towards the employees at what I like to call the White House or Building 3 they feed you and tell you about yoga, ping pong tournaments, the great cafeteria, volleyball, the gym, taking walks, the importance of being able to relax and Gary and Mings vision of a happy work environment. Smoke and mirrors is all they’re telling you if you’re a warehouse employee it’s two completely different worlds and you’re an absolute number in the warehouse or building 5 and you learn that quickly. Typically it’s very easy money though I will say I’ve never seen more of a failure in a system than their warehouse so a lot of milk time so bring your cookies but they’re starting to veer towards an Amazon warehouse environment and regime. But the difference is the people who run the warehouse appear to be a little to small for their britches and aren’t built for management especially after the money they hemorrhaged in 2019 with unnecessary overtime that pushed them way beyond their budget but building 3 is out of sight so they assume everything is necessary which is really not absolutely no more production was made with their large amounts of overtime than if everybody would’ve been sent home on time. Also everything sounds great like they care about their employees which they care about the big boy building employees but theirs a lot of fine print that you learn that makes you realize you’re a number in the warehouse unlike what they promote your worth Good to start your career or if you are about to retire with good benefits Pros: good benefits, good products, Below are strictly for ERP IT - good to start your career, good if you are in your final years of retirement and don't have any drive left for work, good if you have passion for something else besides the work, you will get lots of time to follow your personal life goals, salary is not great but average based on the market If you are below mediocre at analytical skills and the ERP knowledge; just want to come at 9 and leave at 4.30; do not have any passion for work, then this is the right Company and great team (ERP) for you. If you are a good analyst then they will keep you as an analyst for rest of your life, but if you are pathetic as an analyst then you will get promoted if you can JUST do the talking Cons: These cons are strictly for ERP IT- No growth opportunity for the deserving candidates, All the managers suck up to the management so if you have different opinion you will be shut down 80% of the ERP Managers don't know the ERP system so if you are good a good ERP Analyst then god bless you with your review and growth opportunities You don't need to know the ERP to grow in your career, you just need to be able to talk in descent English (still there are some managers who don't even speak proper English and suck at managing people which will also make you wonder what got them to that position) If you are the one who can troubleshoot and fix the issue quickly this is not the company for you If you don't know Oracle ERP but know how to create the SRs to fix the issue and make it SEV1 and provide visibility to the Great work environment, has leadership issues Management has a hard time filling out paperwork on time. If you don't work on actual products your chances of being promoted are slim. Otherwise, it is a friendly and nice place to work with good food. Flexible work hours bad management Productive and fun place Productive and fun place. Would recommend. I worked in the aviation department, but there are 5 departments depending on what your desire is. Most people where I worked where under 30 years old so needless to say there are a lot of young people here. Good culture An ethical and hardworking company. For its size, it does a good job at making employees feel valued. Compensation is fair and allows room for growth. Good work life balance Garmin is a great company to work form. They treat their employees as humans and not machines and invest in their health and mental well being as well. Interesting products Handled incoming customer calls for support. Learned a great seal about fitness products. Very structured. The commute. Helping customers solve their issues. Decent Company Most people are great to work with. There are some backwards and outdated views by those in senior positions. Relatively flexible on work time and time off but not with remote work. Consistently put out great products Garmin continues to put out fantastic, quality, cutting edge products. This is an engineering company, and as such, they under value other areas. In particular SALES! Great benefits decent pay Benefits are fantastic but unfortunately you can't pay for bills with them be nice if they would match the enthusiasm fir them to the pay scale. Great environment to work in though. Garmin International Wonderful company to work for. Excellent management and benefits! HQ in Kansas City is similar to Google. Exercise rooms, cafeteria, thinking zone... extra 2 Nice place to work. Good culture, fair compensation, great 401k. Politics gets a bit annoying from time to time, but over all it's a good place to work. Good opportunities for growth. Great Hardware, Miserable Software, Gatekeeping coworkers My compensation as an intern was fantastic, and the building I worked in was very modern, comfortable, infinite coffee, etc. HR were very pleasant people. I shared an office essentially sitting back to back with my supervisor. It was a small box with no windows and those hellish fluorescent lights. I was given a task or two at a time, the location of the software repositories, and the necessary embedded devices to work on. Their C had no clear organization. No modularity. No consistent coding style. Virtually zero use of comments and no documentation. The ""documentation"" was asking my supervisor for some, to which the inevitable reply was something along the lines of ""Oh so-and-so down the hall wrote that. Walk over and ask him about it."" or better yet he'd recite some rat's nest of function calls and files to me as canon. Over the top compensation Technical debt Great people, horrible management, pay, job duties. Was a great company to work for but no pay or raises. Over worked with amount of duties had to perform. Wanted to give me a promotion with no raise in pay. Great place for work. Not a great place for pay. Seems like they consider a great place to work part of the compensation. It is a young company that got really big, really fast. So the structure is very flat and there is little to no room for advancement. Avoid the Call Center Unfortunately, the call center has been under bad management for sometime and employees are being treated like robots. Supervisors only want people who are C players. People who show up and do what they are told and don't try to do anything else. They have limited training opportunities to the Salem Call Center, leaving them high and dry for advancement opportunities. Good place to work This is a good place to work. The work environment is great and the people are friendly and the teams are more like family. The job has great benefits Growing too fast and is currently having growing pains I have seen several high level managers quit (some without another job to go to) due to being blamed for lack of producing when it is obvious they are under-resourced. Coworkers were great fun, there was an exercise room on site. Working for Garmin was a great opportunity, I was always treated well, and the pay and benefits were good. It was nice to learn troubleshooting skills that I still use today. The coworkers were the BEST!!! Most of the management team were outstanding! Strange culture. Coming in to work and working hard doesn't seem to be enough. Need to fit in or you'll get drive out. H R. Very questionable in my op Amazing effort from top. Unfortunately HR is poison. Couldn't stand the suck up culture and pressure to conform. Just wasn't for me. Great opportunity for some of you can be a yes man. Benefits, Training expectations reasonable Pay could be better. Management. H.R. Great if you're coasting til retirement I will preface this by saying I was in the PND department for my entire tenure at Garmin. From what I understand, the departments vary considerably from one to the next. The job is very safe to the point that it's even unlikely that you'll be promoted, let alone fired. The projects were basically the same thing over and over again ad nauseum. There's not a lot, if any, opportunity to learn new skills since, as I said, the projects are largely the same from one iteration to the next. This would be a great place if you're just looking for a decent paycheck and benefits. Poor management The management in the warehouse is underwhelming. The supervisors know nothing of the departments they are over as well as the dont care to know what you do. The ""coaching "" is a joke. Horrible Place Garmin is awful. Awful Pay at its finest. If you wanna make $13 an hour WITH a college degree this is the job for you. They also will overlook you for promotion. They would rather promote their friends oppose to people who actually have the experience. None Everything about Garmin is a con College rookie trying to play in the NFL A leading company for many products. Management lacks long term strategy in certain divisions. My division's focus is on 3rd party audit preparation and maintaining industry certifications. Customers come last. Especially during the production phase. You are on your own to make things happen like a superhero. Being a superhero is expected behavior and warrants an average rating during the annual review. Building your career is also a solo endeavor. Many work experiences are hard to translate to other companies in the same assignment. Good for 1-5 years of experience out of college then move on. Benefits, Promotes healthy life style, Beer at company events Inexperienced Managers, Ineffective business strategy, Can't maintain long term customer relationships A talented, friendly workforce. No discernable path for advancement. You will not work with a friendlier, more talented group of people. The workplace is very relaxed, but maintains a sense of purpose and high-energy, if you can appreciate how those two go together. There are a lot of groups from pilots to cyclists, runners, etc. which lends itself to a very active, healthy workforce. It is also a very young workforce generally. Garmin only suffers as most employers do in that there are no goals set forth for advancement. Management is very detached and it is hard to tell what activities, if any, will lead to promotion or opportunity. The benefits compensate for the lower comparable wage. As a place to work, I have nothing but good things to say. Don't work in the call center. I supervised people on the software support and customer service teams. The employees were great, but the contact center manager was horrible. The customers were usually good to deal with. Good 401k/Health - low salary and advancement - mngmt -- just ok Great place to have a job -- but for the for the most part, not a place to evolve a career. Several made the transition from intern to FT, but probably because they do not know better. The pay is below market, benefits are above market. But room to grow is 0 if you are at a mid or senior level. Lean structure which is good and bad, as it limits the advancement of good people wanting to move into other positions. Advertise internally that leaders are needed, but it is a bit bogus when there are no new leadership positions open. A good ""job"" to clock and learn early in you work-life, hard to picture it as a long term career of more that 5 years. Several senior engineers say that they stay there because they are satisfied with what they get....good for them. Great atmosphere, hands off management One of the best companies I’ve worked for. Plenty of room for advancement, but competition is high. Group functions with free food, and give away Garmin products. Management could be a little more involved, but I appreciated the hands off trust. Pay based on Olathe KS headquarters, not conducive with cost of living in Salem OR. Overall, great experience, and I enjoyed my time there. Group functions, liberal management Pay based on Olathe, Ks, not enough for Salem, Or Pay Sucks I worked there 7yrs+ pay increase 1-2% maybe if you didn’t get screwed out of 2yrs worth for the same issue. No recognition for those that don’t abuse the FMLA process. Good Insurance and 401k Horrible Pay Consistently put out great products Garmin continues to put out fantastic, quality, cutting edge products. This is an engineering company, and as such, they under value other areas. In particular SALES! Great place to develop my skillset Great place to develop my skill set. Everyone was open and ready to help me whenever I needed it. I hope to work there again someday. The culture was great for a guys like me. 5 Garmin typical day It was an enjoyable place to work. Had great co-workers and great benefits. Was challenging but fun. The hardest part was keeping up with customer orders. There were so many products, it created variety in what you would do. 5 1 Productive and challenging place to work. Work at Garmin is regularly challenging and rewarding. Management is supportive and getting to contribute to developing products that are used by consumers is rewarding. Interesting business A leading company in its field. management was poor and had their own click. Looked down upon lower level managers. too many consultants brought in to shake things up. maps management Hoped for better Garmin gets good reviews as far as a company to work for, and it is good. I just hoped for a better workplace culture. There isn't much team unity, comradery, loyalty, or social aspect. Basically, everyone is there just to punch a time clock. At least in my department, documentation, and sometimes design, is nonexistent, which leads to massive amounts of wasted time. If people aren't forced to do something, they won't. The culture is ""push hard and get it done"", which ultimately leads to having to redo things and than there is no clear design or documentation for the next guy. The amount of wasted time due to disorganization is amazing. Company benefits, work/life balance. Disorganized and lacks a culture where people care to improve the situation. Good benefits nice environment The job is stressfull by answering phone calls and emails at the same time. Worked 3 years with no pay increase except cost of living. Benefit package was very good. Working enviroment was clean Always cold and no pay increase Decent environment no advancement Garmin distribution is a decent starter job or someone looking to add a few years before retirement but if your looking for advancement a degree is all that will ensure your chances. There is discrimination there however depending on how you look or dress depends on if the management takes a liking to you instead of basing it off of your work ethic. I’ve witnessed a lot of good people not get selected for advancements due to the management selecting less qualified canidates due to personal preferences . Clean environment Bad leadership no advancement Oh Garmin, the sweet review! I recommend this job to those that are starting out in their career (from call center positions to engineers). I would also recommend to continue to look for better positions within/ and outside once you feel you may be burned out. I have been here 7 years, and have worked in 3 departments. Pay is mediocre although health benefits are amazing. A typical day is from start to finish on the phones. You have 2-15 minute breaks that you are required to stay within. The Attendance Program is super easy and resets every quarter. Do not get on their eye site, and never cross a manager. They will quickly remove you from their company. Over my 7 years at the OCC, I have seen numerous key star employees be let go and banned after years of excellent service, and for the most unbelievable shocking reasons. A few examples: social media postings, new management not taking to someone, notifying upper management of any dissatisfaction, and whatever you do, do not feel comfortable to take advantage of their federal program allowing medical leave. You will be scrutinized, even so. Be smart where you apply. Great company overall, better management is highly desired. You want to feel a manager cares about your overall success and builds you within. You are on your own, so attend training/educational classes and prove your worth to other positions. If you know someone who works here, you have a better chance of getting hired. I heard a reply after 2 months of my initial application. I followed up calls, and once I heard from them, it was time for the U/A and I started training the 3rd day. Benefits, Culture, Training Management, Changing their Culture, No worthwhile raises Decent Place to Work but poor job advancement Garmin has products that basically sell themselves, but you are able to build relationships with customers. The biggest problem is that the promotions that are from within are bringing in associates from different areas of the company rather than filling jobs from the experienced, existing teams. This is due to perceived pressure for diversity from upper management. Nice campus and good location Poor job advancement opportunities Great environmen and benefits Garmin was a great place to work. Company culture and work/life balance were good at least in my position. They're a community minded organization and provide opportunities to serve the community. I'd recommend it prospective employees. Benefits are industry-leading Not much chace for lateral movement within the company, in my experience. Great work experience Very relaxed work experience at Garmin for the call center positions. Ordinarily, call centers are very stressful experiences and there is a very high turnover rate. That is not the case at Garmin. You feel like you are a valuable part of the team from the get-go. Dress code is very casual which is great. Pay for a summer product support specialist was $13.50 per hour. Great work environment Its a call center job. Great place to work The people were great and very kind. It was a great, stress free place to work. The training for new devices were well planned and easy to participate. Active Lifestyle Company Consumer electronics company where an active lifestyle is encouraged; from cycling and running, to aviation and marine. Stable business diversified across multiple products and categories. Family Friendly Benefits, Stable with Low Volatility Production Cycles, Constrained Software Resources A good company to work for. Garmin is a good company to work for, but very hard to advance because of limited positions available. Raises are very little and not guaranteed. A lot of good old boys giving benefits to friends instead of qualified employees. Benefits Advancement Garmin it just like an office we clean computers desk a lot of etc This jobs are awesome I really like it we clock in work at the same time until first brake it take 15 minutes and w clean the whole building just second floor and w do as fast as w can make it up to our time but like as we did clean the room dest computers dust anything vacuum the floor wipe the table off with dowel w also have a card with anything on for cleaning stuff we also mopped the floor we do a lot of this in Garmin Provide lunches It’s an office Garmin Garmin is the cutting edge of GPS and learning the technology that went into them was really neat. This company has a cafeteria and a gym for the employees to use. The fast pace and team work makes for the work day to seem short! Garmin is very big on team leading skills and building safe and practical skills. everyone is treated very fair and it is a causal dress code for everyone including the CEO. Pay and Benefits Company that respects employees based on skill and performance Garmin advances specialists based on yearly job performance reviews and conducts in-house interviews to fill promotional positions. Raise are also based on performance which naturally encourages employees who like their jobs to continue learning and increasing performance and those that do not perform well or do not like what they are doing at Garmin will quit of their own volition without encouragement from management. Great people - Very busy days with opportunities to work with all areas of the company - No career paths for employees not in engineering - Ability to work remotely when needed Amazing Products and Great Place to Work Garmin is an innovative industry leader. The products are super fun and the environment laid back and collaborative. Leadership is open-minded and cares greatly for their employees. Great Products and People Too far from home. Great place to work Garmin cares about their employees. The benefits and compensation packages are nice. There are a lot of extra curricular activities they encourage you to participate in. They also provide plenty of training opportunities for personal and career advancement."
Central Mutual Insurance Company| Culture Central is moving in the right direction and looking to diversify the workplace. The work life balance is great with flex time. Great for a small town and the people are great. mainly okay, could be better This company seems very family like in most aspects. However, there is a lack of empowerment from supervision. Also, supervisors micromanage associates- even reading associates emails for no good reason. Good culture Values employee and family. Flex time with work at home 3 days a week. 37.5 hour work week. Prior to Covid very little turnover and many worked 30 to 40 years Good benefits and pension Limited advancement unless you can move 1 Amazing culture and opportunity for advancement Thoroughly impressed with the integrity and kindness of the people within the organization. Family type environment and I feel valued as an employee and as an individual. Culture!!! Pension, benefits, etc. Great culture, not enough direction. Great co-workers and company culture. Promotions are based on who you know and time instead of experience it seems. There isn't a lot of clear direction from upper management. Central is a great place to work! An easy to go to job with plenty of opportunity for advancement! The people are great and the culture and atmosphere are one of a kind. Training is thorough and coworkers are very willing to assist.

Vestmark, Inc.| Good place to work Vestmark has highly structured , process oriented teams. Team members are supportive and collaborate on day-to-day tasks. Management was doing a great job.

We do have some managers that have graduated from technical positions and are not necessarily managers by trade, But, as a whole, management is fair, supportive and proactive with their direct reports.

The company tries to foster a fun work environment and has several events throughout the year. For example, food/drinks for Red Sox and Patriots season openers, paint/game nights, weekly summer outdoor events, company-wide summer and winter holiday parties, and numerous other events. Salaries at Vestmark are competitive. We have great health insurance (low premiums), 401k matching, all market holidays off plus 20 PTO days and equity.

Several parties, several employee social events, good benefits Great product, great company I've worked at Vestmark for over 10 years and believe this is a great place to work. I've watched upper management steer the product vision to meet market shifts and demands and they have been right on target. The company has established itself as a leader in a space that is hard to break through. The leadership in Engineering is great. We do have some managers that have graduated from technical positions and are not necessarily managers by trade, But, as a whole, management is fair, supportive and proactive with their direct reports. Work/life balance is very good here. We don't expect the 'hero' mentality and if someone puts in extra hours at night or on the weekends, it's acknowledged and reciprocated. The company tries to foster a fun work environment and has several events throughout the year. For example, food/drinks for Red Sox and Patriots season openers, paint/game nights, weekly summer outdoor events, company-wide summer and winter holiday parties, and numerous other events. Salaries at Vestmark are competitive. We have great health insurance (low premiums), 401k matching, all market holidays off plus 20 PTO days and equity. The main area that needs improvement is cross-team communication and collaboration. There are lots of people in the company who have been here 10+ years and it can sometimes be difficult to let go of the ways of the past and make the bigger changes that will support the growth and scaling of the company. work/life balance, management, benefits challenges with growth and scaling awful management The Executive and Management team are mostly put in place by default of longevity with the company.

Team members are supportive and collaborate on day-to-day tasks. Management was doing a great job. It was unfortunate that I was part of the workforce that got laid off during the COVID period in 2020. I really enjoyed my time at the company. Definitely a great place to start your career and offers a lot of learning potential. Amazing team Thank you very much for the extremely positive feedback. We hear this often and are very proud to be considered as a Best Place to Work. Great company culture and benefits Great culture with strong collaboration amongst teams. Everybody is willing to put the team first and the company lives by their core values. Benefits are outstanding with very little out of pocket for insurance and BCBS covers just about everything. Excellent management team which values employee feedback and keeps an open line of communication. No huge egos to deal with or manage. Work-life balance, great benefits, interesting work, excellent management team 401k match, bonus program Agile team allowed to work on new technologies in order to make the application better Terrific team in an agile environment allowed to work on new technologies in order to make the application better. Cloud application allows for future growth Fun place to work Company is supportive of balancing personal life of employees. Monthly meetings provide an ongoing view of how the company is doing as well as the latest improvements of the product. A little-known, but very good company A place where employees are treated very well and where overall the consensus by management is to make it a positive environment for all employees. The challenge for the firm is to modernize the user experience of its platform which is very robust and powerful but complex to use. If/when they get that addressed, it will be great tech for the market they are targeting. Nevertheless, a really nice company to work for. Great culture, focus on employee satisfaction, company pays higher % of healthcare coverage than most companies Slightly lower salaries Great Job Culture There was no doubt that the Vestmark Community was the best I had ever experienced as an intern. This was the most inclusive internship that I had ever taken part of in my years as a college student. Overall, this was a great group of people and the environment was energized but not too overwhelming. V-Bash Gathering Management Poor managment Management does not support their direct reports. It's all about Cover Your Own Butt. Good Ole Boy frat mentality. Certain managers hold grudges and never let them go so you feel like you're walking around with a bullseye on your back.

KBR|" 4 stars What is the best part of working at the company? pay , you will always see it on schedule time. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Managing employees is the main thing people from different cultures What is the work environment and culture like at the company? depends on what part of the world you work in. What is a typical day like for you at the company? A typical day is like bankers hours with out the bank. Good Good place to work but probably going out of business. This company KBR that is use to be Honeywell they also used to let employees work from home during Covid Terrible Terrible place to work for the management was a joke if not family you would get laid off would not recommend anyone to work for them bad place for sure KBR is a good company. The longer you are with the company you are likely to excel. Work is repetitive in my field. I've learned as much as I can at my level. Workplace culture is overall positive. The company does a great job with inclusivity. Our foreign work force is always recognized for their hard work. I love that. I truly applaud the company for that effort. However, there are areas that can be improved. Consistent communication can be improved upon. Despite my friends from other countries, I’ve never felt like a valued employee. Adding clarity, I have never needed individual recognition, but I felt our department has had many successful feats without notice from the hierarchy. I know, I know, I just mentioned how our foreign workforce is lauded. After 4 years you can see the leadership's focus on results subsides the small accomplishments of one department. On occasion, the Managers/Supervisors commonsense indicator needs to be calibrated but overall, I think they are fair. The most enjoyable part is job security. They need these positions filled so you have some level of security. Again, I reward the company with a B+ which is still very positive. Pay; Ability to learn a lot; Networking; Mobility; Leadership not possessing leadership skills. Leadership not accurately interpreting company policy. Decent place to work Although not nearly as good as the old Brown & Root days KBR is still a decent place to work. Every company goes through changes and KBR is certainly no exception. Best company ever, Productivity,Fun,Good Managment ,Open minded Peopel KBR Company is one of the best companies in the world, it teach me a lot of thinks in my work as a begener, really good managment who give value to a skilled peopel,good culture,fun at work with a good coordination and cooperation on the work activities, type of company that i recomanded to anyone that need to inhance and improuve his working skills. Would be a great place but... KBR would be a great place to work if they didn't over work the good employees without compensation. Most of us work 55 hours or more but we don't receive overtime or comp time. Fun Great money fun work environment long hours stressful but always enjoyed the work working with the military is hard but well worth it I would definitely do it again Yes great company Great company to work for good benefits company takes good care of their employees overall good pay scale great hours an days of work heavy on safety Good People The People are good to work with. Open door, so you can talk to them as needed. You get the support you need when needed. Contract work could be adventurous. Remember that I worked in a War Zone Security was excellent even in the war zone KBR ,The USForces pretected us in every possible way they could,missiles would come in and around the base ,just remember that we workers were over there supporting the troops and America, the wages were very good,it was cold it was hot but remember that we made that choice!!! Meals, beds provided Long hrs, 7 days a week for 12 weeks then R and R Combo Welder Position They pay good, They Appreciate Good work, and they keep you on if you can test out a relocate. They care about employee upward mobility, if you will work at it you can win with them. I love that Company The Ideal Place to Work This company has the perfect work life balance. We have been able to operate remotely and that should not be changing in the near future which allows it employees to enjoy time with family. Great people I worked here for 7 years and became very close with many of my coworkers. I had plenty of opportunities to advance and management was always easy to talk to… Ehh They preach that the do the right thing and that is all about team work but most of the management only care about themselves and the people who kiss their butts. Flexible KBR is a great place to work ! Great team, flexible but target and achievements are monitored from higher up! Management and team members are willing to resolve any issue end-to-end. Offers 401K match, great health benefits, salary increments based on performance! You can get 200hours of PTO based on year of service and 400 hours can be carried over at the max. Very flexible on work schedules as long as the work was completed on time. Great place to work and plenty of management support. I never felt rushed, and the company is very keen on implementation of continuous improvement. Exceptionally good communications with management on a weekly basis. Flexible work schedules None Quality of the team I worked with -- one of the best teams I've worked with in my career I worked with a team of managers at KBR on a bid to manage the Strategic Petroleum Reserves for the US Department of Energy. Most of my work was at home, independent of the others on the team. KBR ultimately did not win the bid, but I thoroughly enjoyed my time working on the project. The leadership was outstanding, the culture was very much ""can do, no problem,"" casual, and results-oriented. While my time working with them was brief, it is still one of the highlights of my career. The pay, the leadership, the team I worked with were outstanding. I can't think of anything I didn't like. Great place to work to maintain work and life balance KBR is a great place to work ! Great team, flexible but target and achievements are monitored from higher up! Management and team members are willing to resolve any issue end-to-end. Offers 401K match, great health benefits, salary increments based on performance! You can get 200hours of PTO based on year of service and 400 hours can be carried over at the max. Revolving Door There’s no work life balance. Micro management is real. May end up doing work not necessarily hired for. Some work areas can be toxic. Benefits are just ok. Joke! Place is a joke! Everyone’s underpaid so Brad can make bigger bonus’s . Brad has a great sales pitch for what seems like a good thing, however after the hiring process it’s fairly easy to see the issues start at the front office and spread like cancer throughout the whole company environment. 4 stars What is the best part of working at the company? pay , you will always see it on schedule time. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Managing employees is the main thing people from different cultures What is the work environment and culture like at the company? depends on what part of the world you work in. What is a typical day like for you at the company? A typical day is like bankers hours with out the bank. Product and workflow combined training. I'm experienced working in the company Excellent workflow combined with essential training. Experienced working with the company. Met with the field of much-experienced personnel. I'm very pleased working with the company. Productive, casual but very focused teamwork. Small group, skilled workers. I have my hours arranged with my boss and if I need to work from home, I let him know my situation and he's been so helpful. The management will allow flexibility in working hours. They want you to produce, keep learning, and work together. There are some really great, knowledgeable, skilled workers at KBR and they communicate well. The hardest part of my job is probably the commute. KBR is actually all over the world, but my work location is about 25 miles south and I had to be cleared before I could work on site. The learning curve is high because the product is rather technical, but they encourage growth and learning, which is my favorite part of the job. I've learned a whole lot there and continue to grow each day. Everyone is very professional and very nice - they enjoy one another and working together. Benefits are some of the best you'll get anywhere and KBR encourages you to use them. Great atmosphere, culture, and benefits The commute Very stable and flexible The management is always trying to help and makes effort to make you feel comfortable. For the amount of work I wish pay was more but a good place to work if you are trying to have a stable job with good benefits. A lot of opportunities to learn new skills while working as well Flex hours, opportunity to be remote, good managers Avg pay. Not a lot of growth. KBR offers employees lots of benefits and a good work life balance KBR is a good place to work. They are employee focused and care about doing the right. Most employees can choose to work from the office or from home. little to no sense of community at the 2400 location I didn't feel a sense of belonging and didn't enjoy my work. Poor leadership in management. Everyone is always too busy to actually create a healthy work culture. Little to no social events or gatherings outside of work. NASA customer, covered parking, annual salary review workplace culture, no sense of community, management's lack in leadership, no clear opportunities for growth Great place to work Been here 4 years and it is a good place to work. I’ve been able to reach my goals and people seem to care what I’m doing. Of course the work sometimes gets mundane but that’s the norm with contract work Lots of bosses and little to none of leadership its who you know Started here earlier this year and saw an immense amount of red flags in my leadership heard from many employees and the characteristics of managers and warnings which is normal for most industries you cant please everyone but the amount of people was saying the same things was concerning. I quickly determined that my direct supervisor was toxic and spread that toxicity and narcissism around the team. Every morning I come in i see everyone is sad and depressed. People are here only to survive everyone's afraid to speak up for fear retribution and retaliatory behavior. I haven't been here long enough to determine if this is an entire company culture issue or if I am just unlucky to placed on this team. Unionized for most of the force Who you know not what you know Remote workers on a distant island As a remote entity supporting a major aerospace vendor, we have very little interaction with KBR management. So long as the customer is happy things keep moving along which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. There is always a collective fear that the contract will change hands or people will be let go once a project ends. Good First Job Good place to start, but not somewhere you want to stay long. There was good variety of projects and new things to get your feet wet in different areas of engineering. But after a few years the projects are mundane and don’t challenge you technically. You hit a plateau and don’t have much of a ceiling to grow. Management doesn’t do a good job at holding workers accountable and they play favorites so the same people get opportunities to progress and everyone else stays the same. They care more about burning contract money than keeping employees engaged and satisfied so there is often very little work to do as it is dispersed among way too many people. Also have to get outside offers to get any decent raises. Great place to work Was a great place to work. Only reason I left was because gas got so high. Just couldn't make it work . People and all I worked with was great. Just couldn't make the commute People Needed more people in the department I worked in High quality company with good atmosphere and organizational culture A little on the micromanagement side, but I felt heard and valued because of the flexibility and interest my lead showed. Lots of company communication that I wasn't really invested in, but the information was good and I could have chosen to get more involved with many projects Highly motivated leadership with lots of opportunities for engagement; reasonably priced benefits No job security Management - Upper management is terrible. They only care about the bottom line: lining their pockets with money. They hire tons of people and fire them at end of project. Good place to work I found my experience with KBR to be beneficial, between projects they were somewhat slow to respond, causing me to sit at home un-paid longer then I thought I would be. Not Acceptable pay Pay is very low. Managers are not technical. Depressing place with morally degrading salary and unsatisfying work. I would have left long time ago but I am stuck here. All I can do is write a review to warn others of this toxic workplace. Horrible place to work with low pay very low pay for skilled people. more managers/ supervisors than the actual workers who have no idea about technical tasks. workers want more pay not a cheap polo t-shirt and pizza party. more meetings than the actual work. I would not recommend KBR to even my worst enemy. somewhat flexible work schedule only due to covid a lot, see my review Teamwork I worked for this company for many years and the team I supported were awesome. When you work with a great team, it makes all the difference in succeeding in your job. Great coworkers Salary was not competitive Kbr I worked for Brown & Root (KBR) for over 25 years. I got time off when I had my children and when I had hospital Surgery. I even got 2 weeks vacation time. Best company company I ever worked for !!! Excellent Management, Great Culture, Plenty of Opportunities The middle management has a lot of flexibility afforded to them by executives, there is a culture of empowering your subordinates and not micromanaging. Very open and honest environment, never had problems with personal misconduct or EO. Good salary and benefits, management is clear and open about retention being a priority. The last few years they have made a huge push to hire younger, and more women, especially to get some more diversity on the hardware/software engineering teams. Perk benefits are also a plus, they offer travel matching, 401k at 4.5%, tuition reimbursement up to $8k per year, and they are great about maternity/paternity leave. Downside is that like many DoD contractors, you are at the mercy of the client. My KBR side supervisor was always understanding in the rare instances a client was particularly difficult about something. Process engineer Newark DE good couture. no job security. limited client. Not a growth environment. good for initial career 2- 3 years but not that growth potential for longer term. Projects are not steady. Frequent up and down. none. as above Auto Dialer Work was easy, 12 hr shifts 4 days on 3 days off. Management unorganized and doesn’t care about the workers, only concern is numbers. Overworked but the pay was good Pay, work schedule 4 stars What is the best part of working at the company? pay , you will always see it on schedule time.

Managing employees is the main thing people from different cultures What is the work environment and culture like at the company? depends on what part of the world you work in. What is a typical day like for you at the company? A typical day is like bankers hours with out the bank. Toxic environment, petty people The leadership has no qualifications other than who they knew in the company. The environment is so toxic. The managers have cliques with their favorite underlings. Backstabbing and pettiness daily. Bring popcorn. You’ll still walk out of the movie after 60 minutes. You only stayed that long because you thought it would get better. It didn’t. It got so much worse. Still no redemption arc. Experience, Learn how not to behave in a professional setting. Toxic, Low pay, micromanagement or lazy management, No in-between, Back biting and gossiping, Bullying from your leadership, HR is just as bad. 5 Overworked, stressed, and unappreciated in KBR Corporate Treasury Group - Houston, Texas The KBR treasury team is overworked, stressed out, unfairly treated, and underappreciated. The treasury team is a revolving door. The Management team either fires the employees or makes the working environment so unbearable that they quit. HR and upper management outside of treasury have been notified and they turn a blind eye and don't do anything about it. Even when there have been complaints, HR has chosen to not investigate by speaking to the employees that are still there. Upper management have been fooled - they drank the Kool-Aid. Every single employee that has left the treasury department have found other jobs and are so much happier - less stress, less of a workload, more time with family, and better pay. It's important to know your worth - don't sit back and work in an environment that is so unhealthy. Life is too short. Some of the employees that have left the team weren't honest when turning in their notice, which didn't help the team members left behind. This management doesn't care about loyalty, longevity, and dedication - none of this matters to the VP. This person is nice as pie to your face but watch out - very devious and calculated. Let's not forget the lies and made up stories that are fed to upper management and HR when trying to figure out the best way to fire you. They will use you for your knowledge and then find ways to get rid of you once they feel you are no longer needed. I highly suggest looking elsewhere before ever considering taking a job in this group. If you don't, remember, I told you so beforehand. 3 Good company I enjoyed my time at KBR. It was fast paced it was good team camaraderie at times it was a bit tense and stressful but overall it was a great experience. productive and fun working company Great place to work, with a lot trainings every week , friendly people, great working culture but job security is not guaranteed. I met a lot of great guy who support and motivate you which made working with KBR a happy place and a second home. Terrible place to work KBR upper management speaks team player, employees most important etc. all the buzz words that suck in people, the reality is far different! No charge number, out the door! Covid 10% pay cut, promised to restore last year… never happened except for upper mgmt! With no charge number no job there is no bench making it almost impossible to staff a job, so you are set up to lose out of the gate. Anyone who thinks KBR is a good place to work is drinking some interesting kool aid None Bottom line driven, insensitive management Great company to work Love my job been with the company for 10 years, it opportunity for growth and development. KBR is a diverse company and we are globally so you can find us all over the world. Great atmosphere to work in Job attitude here is focused on safety as the number 1 priority. While we deadlines and target dates to hit, productivity does not before safety. This is somewhat of a new experience for me as I come from the oil and gas industry into a manufacturing environment. Everyone here has contributed to making my transition a smooth and successful one. High turnover at McIntosh says bad management McIntosh kbr is the worst site of all.packaging supervisor are messy. The turnover of employees is high due to low pay and management. Anytime a company hires all the time for the same job role that tell you something about that job Plenty of overtime Messy management Worst Company EVER. Please Avoid for your own good KBR exploits workers like no others. Pays very little. no where near the salary mentioned in its profile page. Very little yearly increase (~2.5%). It hires immigrant students and h1b and exploits them. I am surprised why this exploit is allowed by US government. KBR works as government contractor and i see very low motivation in the staffs due to low pay. this is the reason the government job is so bad and takes forever to complete. i hope government does something and dont allow this low pay, low grade KBR to exist. Avoid KBR at any cost you will be much happy mentally and financially. 0 stars from me for KBR. Easy job but not a secure job Easy enough work making masks for 16 an hour but was only there for 2 months before the entire warehouse was laid off after contract with Honeywell fell through. It was a good place to work the people were great. I worked overseas in Iraq. The company was good to me. I work for 6 years, And I loved every bit of it. I was a housing coordinator for a year and a 1/2 in a Built-in coordinator for the rest of my time there. Cool work with laid back environment Typical day at work is laid back and no micromanagement. Able to get a lot done and feel as if my work makes a difference in the real defense industry. I was fired from the Company Overall a great company; However I was unfairly targeted which led to me being fired from the Company after 18 years of consistently meeting all goals and expectations. There were occasions that we share brefast,lunches and happy birthdays Awsome.. I had experience with B&R in the past. The last experience was last 2019-2020. It is a really good organization very professional. This time I felt my self very well been part of the teamwork, everybody doing their job. None lunch was avalable at these time. None. Worse place I’ve ever worked at. Treasury group. Revolving door. I worked in the corporate treasury group. That team and group is a revolving door. The VP/Treasurer will run anyone out and doesn’t care. You feel no job security and have to walk on eggshells when working there. I only stayed for 10 months and saw literally more than half the team quit during my tenure. Pay sucks and so does the VP. The bad thing is that senior management thinks she’s doing a great job. Run away! And don’t say I didn’t warn you. Nothing Everything Great place to work! KBR walks the walk. I have heard companies talk about work life balance but it was just talk, at KBR, they walk the walk! Great environment, great management team, great benefits, meaningful work, opportunity for growth, the list goes on and on! Administrative Specialist IV is a great role, however, after receiving a degree I just received a pat on the back, and keep up the good work. Great company, enjoy working there just wish there was more advancement and capability to advance in other departments. Many employees are leaving in order to get paid what they are worth. It was fun to work with KBR team It is generous company, with great pay, great appreciation, when you do your work with standard. Encourage, and appreciation are their daily tasks to give for employees. Great people, great pay and great atmosphere of team work. its an ok job its an ok job. I work in kuwait on the MAP-K project. management is not the best. the pay is good. working long hours and being away from family is kind of hard. I loved the pay as well as how they stand beside their customers or employees. I enjoyed working for this company because everything I heard about it, it was just that. I would work for this company again and again and tell otehrs 4 stars What is the best part of working at the company? pay , you will always see it on schedule time. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Managing employees is the main thing people from different cultures What is the work environment and culture like at the company? depends on what part of the world you work in. What is a typical day like for you at the company? A typical day is like bankers hours with out the bank. Recreation, pay, and the new faces you see daily KBR is one of the best companies I've worked for. If given opportunity to work this company, I most certainly would. I would strongly recommend this company to anyone that is seeking the opportunity. Great pay, Meeting people from around the world. They strongly focus on health and safety of the employee Vacation pacakage not all that good. 1 Can’t complain too much Company isn’t bad honestly. The benefits can use a little tailoring because the cost is a little high but the insurance coverage is great. The pay is really nice for the work life balance. Management is about 50/50 qualified. There is room for growth but the work force is older for sure. The average age is about 40-50 which is kind of strange but the place moves like a moderately oiled machine. Like everywhere else there is a buddy buddy system and good old boy network but hard workers do get recognition sometimes. You get what you put out mostly. Good benefits Union workforce Great work life balance Overall great environment Accountability is almost nonexistent for some people No cafeteria 1 Exciting project work but little job security Department managers did their best to keep their people and move them from project to project, but most of the work is going offshore. The work here is that either feast or famine. Good people to work with, exciting work, good pay Lack of job security Typical large defense contractor. KBR is not a bad company. There are a lot of friendly people to work with, and the company has a lot of work. The leadership has managed through COVID challenges with compassion and empathy. There is a strong focus on the health and safety of all employees and customers. Turnover seems to be lower than other companies of the same size. There are a variety of job opportunities ranging from entry level administrative to advanced, The company doesn't often go outside to hire in senior leadership and promotes from within, Friendly people Compensation is mediocre, M&A impacts the Forming, Storming, Norming, and Performing cycle, A lag in aligning strategy to vision like most big companies, You will need to be comfortable having responsibility without empowerment, Too many low-value internal meetings and a lot of focus on process for the sake of process KBR is a ""hit the ground running"" kid of company. They have a purpose and you, as an employee, are expected to help take on that purpose. I absolutely loved my time with KBR. It was always busy and I learned many new things and skills with them. Sometimes they listen to their clients over their employees. Still I would do it all over again in a heartbeat. Great pay Sometimes very long hours but not always. Great pay and benes but the management is atrocious Great pay and benefits but the management is unethical, unprofessional, demeaning, not inclusive nor equitable. Get everything in writing and document everything your first 6 months. Great place to work good pay people were great I love the schedule the days off for a lovely fast Pace easy way to move up everybody was cool and everybody was nice the commute was very short I love the location I love the facility facility was very clean management was outstanding Poor management Management needs to be on the floor leading by example. No recognition for those that are setting the example. Too far and few cost of living increases. Employee/management team is an us against them culture, not productive. Work/life balance Everything else Like family Keep in touch! Occasional turnarounds. Have nccer, safety council, Physically fit, Clean work history. Show up ready to work. Work safety. Listen carefully. Nice environment None Fun workplace Manny experiences encountered Electrical Q/A Inspections and repair by electrical shop. A very good experience working with management and co-workers Worked on electrical system and bring up to standards. INSCOM (G4 GIL) Korea INSCOM (G4 GIL) Korea If you don't want to work for the government, but still want to As a member of the union, job security is, well..secured. It takes a lot to get fired--like you really need to messs-up to do so. The leadership is top-notch in my opinion--mostly comprised of vets. This is great because direction is clear...unless you're unfortunate and get some incapable supervisors/managers.. Wasn't the case for me though. Love the work-life balance..PTO, Sick leave, personal holidays and 11 paid holidays! LOVE IT.. Never spent more time with my family compared to other employers. The leadership, at least supervisors will require some improvement..but then again, everyone else just needs to do their job and stick to the objectives of the day/week/month/year. work-life balance; union worker unless you're a supervisor and above lazy coworkers, you're part of the union, occasional inept supervisors/managers Gone Woke KBR’s corporate culture has gone woke in the last couple of years. Things like unconscious bias training are now mandatory. Alternative lifestyles are promoted, but traditional values are never mentioned. Work/life balance Woke I do not recommend working here This organization has a terrible onboarding process, they provide little to no information, training or guidance and you have to figure things out by yourself constantly but you are expected to deliver and perform. I would not work for this organization. Sets the stage well for good success at the job and the work. KBR is focused on performance, delivering the absolute best for the Client. From Top Management to the Line Worker in the Field, every aspect of the needed Job requirements are considered and tailored to provide for success. KBR works to keep their skilled workers satisfied and at maximum productivity. A Winning Formula. Working with good People. Everything provided. None Outstanding company Outstanding company with a solid corporate culture and good attitude towards employees. Good compensation, great atmosphere inside teams and well-established work processes. Compensation, professionalism The amount of workload is sometimes overwhelming Working for KBR In theory, KBR could be a fabulous place to work. In actuality, it is more depressing that not. Double standards are in play. Say one thing and do the exact opposite happens frequently. What's wrong for you, is ok for a ""friend"" If you are not the same ethnic group, then you become illiterate and are occasionally talked down to. Brow beating is a better term. It is an atmosphere where diversity and inclusion becomes subjecting and humiliation. Micromanagement is rampant. Retalliation is prevalent. Many people work many hours without compensation. Of course the leadership will always say, no one told you to do so; however, if extra time is required to complete a mission, usually that is a no no. Example, during the onset of COVID, many people, in order to complete the tasks at hand, worked 15 plus hours a day, only to be told, KBR would no pay over 12. We had a choice, mission failure or do the job. If you have mission failure, you are called in and humiliated. To avoid that, we just did the job. The blind eye approach of the Senior Leadership is what really becomes embarrassing. Perhaps they should try the undercover boss approach to see what is really happening... if they really do care. Of course, I am only speaking of the contracts I have worked on. I am sure somewhere there must be an atmosphere where folks are happy employees. There are also a host of extremely good leaders and employees working for KBR on project, I am sure where the atmosphere is very pleasant. Vaccines, food, laundry services, housing are free Transportation is almost non existent and what is available, many would never be allowed on highways in the US or Europe. Supplies, parts, take a tremendous amount of time to be purchased and arrive. Excellent company to work for The company turned my job into a career. Provides ongoing training. Additionally, the pay is great, along with the benefits. My team is the best, from management down to me. Safety and Zero Harm is the culture. Work environment, pay None Great place to work At the time I worked there what I noticed most was the amount of over all experience there was for all the disciplines. They could engineer and build anything and it was great to be apart of the team. Lack of integrity when it comes to leadership. I have worked for KBR for 10 years. During this time I have found that when issues arise that point out the failures of management, the company does not take the necessary steps to ensure that the ones pointing out the issues are anonymous and more importantly free from retaliation. I have personally been involved in this and it left a big stain on the company from my point of view. I enjoy my job but the hassle of having to be careful of what you say will be a looming concern. Please take this into consideration when applying. Flexible hours Lack of integrity of management Long hours but excellent pay. KBR was a great place to work when I was employed there. Advanced training, excellent benefits, and awesome leadership were a few of the things that stood out. Safety was a priority within their business culture from the CEO all they way down to the Logistic Warehousemen. KBR specializes in Military support such as MHE equipment, communication devices, Military vehicles, to government issued PPE. Benefits Long hours 4 stars What is the best part of working at the company? pay , you will always see it on schedule time. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Managing employees is the main thing people from different cultures What is the work environment and culture like at the company? depends on what part of the world you work in. What is a typical day like for you at the company? A typical day is like bankers hours with out the bank. Decent contracting job to get your foot in the door Shipboard is what you make of it but as soon as you leave the states you are basically non existent to the company as we seen when the pandemic hit it only confirmed our statements of how things where being handled 2 Terrible company Terrible company and company management not much room for growth lazy personnel are allowed to grow as long as they’re in the in crowd Egotastic management None Everything 3 2 Great Company to work for. The managers care about they people they bring in will fit in with the companies culture. Interviews are panel, they move quickly to hire. Onboarding could be better but I think they are working on it. They do give you the tools and training to be successful. Pay, work/life balance, culture Contracting world companies are coming for the employees so retention is a problem. Great money and travel experience Good company to work for international work. Working on a military base in a foreign country and having the opportunity to work along side foreign nationals and other military members. Great money Work everyday because its all about the money Good pay and hours, not great environment 3 day weekends, every other week. Optional overtime was offered. Management was kind of joke. Changing things every other day, and never really having anything set in stone. Great company to work for, productive and professional all the way Great company to work for if you are willing to sacrifice been away from the family, pay is great and easy work, Safety is the Number one priority for everything no matter what. If you are a team player and can follow rules and adapt. Welcome, this is the company for you. Salaries Limited Vacation time Worst job experience ever. I regret ever taking this job. My start date kept getting pushed out further and further away from the initial start date I had expected to start but by that time I had already given my 2 weeks notice at my previous job and didn’t actually get to start working for a almost 3 weeks until my last day from my previous job. When I actually got to start, I found out that I was completely on my own at the Honeywell facility I was sent to work at. There were no other maintenance workers around that I was expecting to work with and and my manager worked in a different state where I was. IT also never got my log in credentials set up for my first day so for the first 2 weeks I was doing absolutely nothing. There was no clear goal of what I was supposed to do the entire time. Pay was good. Lots of free time to look for a new job. Everything else Good pay , Decent work Good pay , got to learn a trade and help me down the road in other jobs. Must be a road warrior to keep busy. Met a ton of good people along the the way. Pay, benifits Away from home most of the year . Sometimes fun place to work I really don’t have anything good to say well the only thing (Good Pay) but they don’t listen their employees they don’t want to do anything to protect them from Covid. Good pay Short breaks, didn’t care about employees Draconian Environment Draconian Environment. Supervisors of software development were NOT former software developers. Requirements for projects were vague and incomplete. No clear chain of command. Not a good team environment. Daily Food Trucks Draconian environment Good while it lasted. Great pay. Great schedule. Got to grow and get the experience as a machine operator. Would have still been there. A few locations including the one i was in laid everyone off. We did get a month notice.. Schedule Short breaks Too Much Outsourcing! It seemed that once a position was vacated in Houston, you were only allowed to replace that person with someone from a high value engineering center such as India or China, unless it was a senior management position. Then they would fill it with one of their cronies. Pay was reasonable and some are really good people. Too many layers of management, not enough people doing the actual work. Enjoyed working at KBR I had a great manager which was always available when needed. Good team work in my group. Staff meetings were informative on what the company was doing, ie new contacts, changes etc… Work required alot of overtime to meet customer needs, but was a good place to work. Good work life balance. None to mention Great Company with a terrible 401k vesting policy I enjoyed my time as a KBR contractor. However. It is completely unheard of for contract labor to have a TWO YEAR vesting requirement before you qualify for a single dollar of the matching funds. Worse. While I understand using vesting as a carrot to get people to stay............having that vesting rule apply to when the company loses it's contract is just ridiculous and shameful. I realize that contract labor is a small segment of KBR's overall mission and their vesting rules are designed for the whole company. But, they simply must revisit. Flat out. If you are being offered by KBR and they have a re-compete inside of 2 years of the hire date, you're crazy to take the job if you want to use the 401k. Solid Salaries and Management 401k vesting policy is comically bad well structured, helpful It is a very well structured organization. The team was very helpful and shared information across the team members. Good knowledge base that you're able to access to get directions for you work. decent job It was good until the contract was cancelled. On your feet for 12 hours. Shift was rotating weekends due to pitman schedule. Had to adjust my schedule with school or other obligations on weekends. good pay on feet for 12 hours Easy money Easy money for the pay. But very hard in the growing phases of the company. Company closed after 6 months. Everyone was cool at the work place. Managment was also nice. Loved KBR As a former employee I really loved this company. I worked on the Government solution side of the company. Great people, always had a great time at work. Best job I ever had in my life. The people and culture Had to deploy overseas at times but it was still fun No benefits or paid vacation Overall good Environment to work. Is several layers of politics. Good sense of safety. Not a lot of room for an advancement. Good challenging workplace. Interesting, Smart Coworkers Very interesting, talented coworkers. Lots of bureaucratic rules, but that probably comes with the territory when working on government contracts. The work is very interesting and lots of opportunities to work on projects that interest you."
Belcan|" Great company, salary was good, great benefits, opportunities for advancement Belcan was a great place to work. Management was strong and coverage from the Recruiters was always there. We had a strong Administrative staff to support us and our customers. It was a very experienced group of people working at Belcan where everyone was able to focus on their primary job responsibilities, overall it was a great place to be employed, great Healthcare, vacation, paid holidays, etc. 2 Friendly & Professional I enjoyed working for Belcan. I got the opportunity to work in a friendly, professional environment. All my colleagues were cooperative. They were always there to help me. I learned a lot I learned a lot about technology working there. I enjoyed the perks and the incentives given to those employees who really perform and of course I am one of those employees. Great job! This is a great job! I cannot explain how much I enjoyed working there. The company provides exceptional pay and benefits and the supervisors are very attentive and very understanding. Friendly people A great place to work and get valuable experience. A lot of friendly people work here and everyone is very willing to help you understand your role and wants to see you succeed. Truly enjoy working here I truly enjoy working at Belcan. Leadership is exceptional and the high quality of my colleagues enables a productive and positive workplace environment in which an employee can grow their skills while remaining highly productive. Company is like a rollercoaster First you're getting good money then your realizing you have no time off to do anything you need to next their cutting your hours so that you can only get 50 hour but still use you for 10 days straight No complaints They never gave me a decent raise in the 5yrs I was with them. I will say the benefits are great, HR is responsive and really came through for me in regards to my short term disability. Opportunities for mentorship It might take a second, but make sure you find a mentor here who you can really connect with. It will make a difference. An honor to work here This is a well-known, prestigious company and I’m honored to be a part of the team, especially for as long as I have. Great stepping stone Contracting through Belcan is a good networking opportunity to get your foot in the aerospace door. Decent benefits and work/life balance. Working at HQ is an odd environment though. Very fun place to work Belcan is such a growth-oriented company. They offer so many different incentives for employees and work hard to make everyone feel appreciated. Love the diversity Loved how diverse the environment was. If you're talented and can add to the company, that’s what they care about. Nothing else matters. Very warm environment The managers here are some of the kindest, most dependable people I’ve met. Their leadership skills are so good that you almost start to feel like you’re a part of a family. Conflict-free zone Usually HR can be stressful, especially at such a big company, but it never was at Belcan. I learned a lot here. Useless work at a company that does nothing This company does absolutely nothing of note. The work is purposeless, there's not really anything to do half the time, management is terrible, very low pay for an engineering job. The only good thing I have to say are that the flexibility is half decent. Positive experience Honestly, Belcan is amazing. I have truly, truly enjoyed my time working here. And that’s all I have to say! Requires some adapting I didn't initially fit in with the company, but I can tell you that it absolutely gets easier. Give it a few months to settle into a routine and get to know how the company works. Decent place to work I've worked for Belcan a few times. Pay was decent but not necessarily competitive (especially compared to other contract work). Benefits were mediocre. I really like the people I worked with, they were the biggest plus. Management seems to pick favorites, I was definitely given opportunities for advancement while I saw other hard workers not given similar chances. There are many groups in engineering that really allow you to find a home to things that peak your interests. Core work hours were 9a-3p and as long as you got your work done and hours in you could come and go as you please. You could also work 4 10 hour days and take every Friday off if you want People, work flexibility Pay, benifits Opportunities galore Belcan is different from past companies I’ve worked with because of how many different employment paths there are and how many opportunities we have to advance through the company. It’s a big growth/development vibe. People I love all my bosses and it has been great working with them. I also work well with all my piers. I love the jobs and our clients. The support staff is also good. Great company, salary was good, great benefits, opportunities for advancement Belcan was a great place to work. Management was strong and coverage from the Recruiters was always there. We had a strong Administrative staff to support us and our customers. It was a very experienced group of people working at Belcan where everyone was able to focus on their primary job responsibilities, overall it was a great place to be employed, great Healthcare, vacation, paid holidays, etc. 2 Easy workplace Not a bad place to work. There is not too much pressure job wise. There is no training. Good thing is there is no micromanagement. There is a good flexibility in schedule. Pay Very busy day here always. Learned you must demonstrate perfect behavior. Management doesn't reward its workers much but will confront you on issues. The workplace culture is good. Hardest part of the job is being torn down by Callers, and management. The most enjoyable part of the job is the pay and bonuses. 1 Supportive workplace Very supportive and gives ability to learn a lot. Flexible work schedule, pay and benefits aren’t great, but team was great. Opportunity for remote work due to Covid. It was fine I loved my last manager she was awesome. Otherwise not my favorite place to be, not a lot of opportunity there in my opinion. Good to build my resume after graduating. Worst place to work I would say for juniors or even mid level engineers , this company doesn’t care and won’t care for your growth. There’s no diversity or culture at all and pay is so minimal. Great company with great benefits Great PTO and benefits package. Schedule is flexible if needed. Office is nicely updated and easy free parking. Coworkers and managers are supportive of career. Complete failure to deliver on any promises. 0 job security. they lose a contract you lose your job. There was no good part of working for Belcan Belcan did not live up to it's promises. I quit a job because Belcan extended an offer for more money, Belcan representatives insisted that when this job runs out they will put me on another job immediately. That was a lie. I worked a week filling out paperwork and doing different corporate training till it was time to go onsite for the customer. the second week I was terminated because Belcan lost it's contract with the company. I was left high and dry by this company. you should look elsewhere for work. Average Continuous extension contract work. No offer of pay increase for any extension. Minimal support besides payroll obligations. Duties are not too technical. Awesome pay horrible understanding of human needs Awesome company if we can get better understanding between office and foremans. Pay was amazing but the hours were slavishly mandated. Water was scarce at times and so was toilet paper. 13 hr shifts 13 days in a row 1 day off the repeat. 4 stars What is the best part of working at the company? My direct supervisors were very personable and good mentors. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? The contract that I worked on had very minimal and pour instructions. This led to a lot of repeated work. Good work experience with low pay I’ve greatly enjoyed my time at Belcan. Management has been wonderful and I got assigned to a project that has given me the opportunity to gain mass amounts of knowledge. The big downside is the lagging market compensation. Work/life balance, flexible schedule, culture Low compensation Sub-contract work only No promotions/advancements. You are assigned to different positions when your current role/contract runs out. Low pay - similar to other contract firms. Some gaps in communication filtered down from corporate to their remote facilities. Some flexibility in work hours. No advancement / low pay. strong management support best part of this job are the managers. they take the time to tell you what needs to be done and trust you to get it done. yet they seem interested to teach/train/demonstrate how to improve your skills to find the same success they experience as a result of their efforts. so far at only 3 months in i am feeling this will be a good fit. Shady Leadership Management creates Statements of Work out of thin air, and keeps employees funded year after year. This might sound positive, but the work isn't real. There is no actual product or result being delivered to the customer. Often, myself, and many of my peers, would go the entire year without any guidance, or actual path toward completing deliverables. December would come around, and management would scramble to make up information in the system, to make it look like we had completed all of our tasks. This is a terrible place to work if you have any interest in developing skill or character, or if you have any shred of ethical dignity. Easy money to sit around doing nothing. No value provided to customer. Bad leadership Favoritism with family and friends they have them working on something their not experienced in and paying them like other hard experience workers that have to do the job for them Managers are not worked expired just school and to know your job u have to get your hands dirty at some point Horrible culture Leadership only cares about themselves. Business continues to decline as more programs continue to be lost and no new work is won. It’s a sinking ship People really cared about me there. Everyone was friendly, managers occasionally take you out to lunch. Very accommodating I worked here for over 4 years. I was able to move up within less than a year and everyone was very nice. Pretty relaxed work environment, and no strict dress code. Flexible with family life, I left early multiple days a week. I miss it! Management often took me out to lunch Only if you really need a job Only a place i would entertain if you really need a job and understand it has a bad work environment with low pay and bad management. Promotions are based on who you're related to or who are friends with. Not based on work. Company will lay off employees at the first sign of an overhead charge code and then try and rehire them when billable again. Used to be family run but turned into a corporate nightmare. No job security The are very slow to reply to your questions even if time sensitive. The company doesn’t care about their clients, it more getting people to get commissions. Don’t try to reach the manager for claims or conflict. He/she will response to the 3rd party favor. Great co-workers. Good company to work for. Benefits are good. Some positions can work from home. Open door policy. Management and coworkers are fun, hardworking people. Valued as an employee. Positive environment. great co-workers no benefits for part-time Great company, salary was good, great benefits, opportunities for advancement Belcan was a great place to work. Management was strong and coverage from the Recruiters was always there. We had a strong Administrative staff to support us and our customers. It was a very experienced group of people working at Belcan where everyone was able to focus on their primary job responsibilities, overall it was a great place to be employed, great Healthcare, vacation, paid holidays, etc. 2 Leadership takes no ownership over projects. Training is literally non-existent. Leadership will not train employees, citing a lack of time and money. Most team leaders will not take ownership over projects that they manage. The environment is extremely dull. There is no room for advancement. Leadership consists of a few people that have been there for a long time, and refuse to let anyone else advance. The best part of the job was that no one paid any attention to me for the first 4 years I worked there. As soon as I started speaking up about the treatment of employees, and the lack of training, leadership became hostile. No one is checking the quality of your work. Hostile leadership. 3 Great People! Pros: Culture, work/life balance, flexible hours, great projects to work on, people are exceptionally friendly. Cons: Pay, job security, current CEO and a few other managers have NO CLUE!! Culture, work/life balance, flexible hours, great projects to work on, people are exceptionally friendly. Pay, job security, current CEO and a few other managers have NO CLUE 4 1 Boring Didn’t know it but was Roped into a job I was overqualified for… need more challenging tasks to match my background, education, and experience! As well as no advancement. Flexible work hours but very poorly managed Employees arrived at varying hours as each selects their own schedule. The work environment can be very noisy at times as there are no cubicles, instead work was performed in a large open room. Many low level managers were not capable of basic management functions. One example is that some workers just socialized all day and got paid for it. Most projects undertaken allowed ample time for completion but occasionally there were tight deadlines which required working more than 8 hours per day. Upper management only dealt with the bottom line and filling empty spots with workers despite those chosen often being poorly qualified. Annual pay increases were so small it was a major embarassment to the company. When the budget tightened up, workers were layed off to save upper management personnel that were really not essential, they were just paper jockeys. Work Hours were selected from 6 am to 9 pm, very flexible Extremely bad management at pretty much every level Loads of work, no days off If you’re here for just the hours/money then this is the place for you, if you’re trying to actually move up in a position and make a name for yourself it’s not going to happened. 7/12s, breaks No days off Great company to work for In my tenure with with Belcan I have learned so much and have been treated with all the respect that one expects from their employer. I encourage an aspiring IT professional to get their foot in the door with Belcan. Flexible hours, supportive management Compensation is below market standard Great place to start a career. Opportunities to grow and learn. Great place to start a career. The biggest perk Belcan offers is their flexible scheduling. They really do a great job accommodating individuals schedules. As long as you got your work done, nobody really complained. Management genuinely seems to care and does their best to support the team. The culture and employees are fun and enjoyable to work with. Pay is somewhat competitive, pending experience. Great work atmosphere, good benefits, caring management Pay isn't as great as some others Non communicative management. Lack of training and poor management communication. Many of co-workers were very toxic to the work environment. The best part of the job was the flexibility. Productive Lack of support from management on production floor. Most of the engineers are very interactive and professional they will help the technicians as much as they can. Lack of support from management on production floor. Empty promises; not focused on safety; impatient They make you believe it’s a great company and they care about your safety. They promise training but they have you learn from other coworkers and don’t give you the appropriate timeframe to learn. There were many times that I had to work with my respirator on and could not see because I require corrective lenses for my vision. I went through their means to get the inserts for the respirator and prescription safety glasses and it took more than 3 weeks to get them. You would think that vision as a chemical operator would be one of the priorities for the company, especially when you need to see hazard labels and make sure the paperwork was correct. It’s more about who you know. If you don’t make the “right” friends, they will alienate you and watch your every move to find anything you might be doing wrong and focus on it. I always assumed that work was about doing your job and not about making friends. Overall, this company suffers from lack of training, poor management, impatient towards new hires (unless you have a family member in a higher position), disregard for safety, and the need to expedite safety equipment for people that require corrective lenses. Starting pay is not worth it, for the type of work you do, dealing with harmful and hazardous chemicals. There are better entry level jobs out there that pay better. Pay half your meal (only beneficial if you work day shift), weekends off Limited lockers, need to focus on safety, impatient management, lack of training Great flexibility and work/life balance Great for right out of college and getting lots of experience on different projects. Awesome work/life balance and flexible hours plus overtime. Coworkers who were great about helping out and teaching Flexible hours Not the best pay They were unwilling to give me an increase in salary. The management leadership left a lot to be desired. Management was unwilling to negotiate salaries after working there and proving your knowledge of the job and deserving of a raise. Was offered a FT job with the contract (Lockheed) I was working on. Micro-management Not a good environment for contract work. As a contractor for Belcan I wasn’t considered part of “the team”. I was contracted to a company in my home state through Belcan. Belcan was nothing more than a means to get my paycheck. As a contracting firm they want your paycheck and that’s it. Not one care is given about your work life or working conditions. The only time I ever heard from anyone at Belcan was when I was hired and when I was laid off. I had to spend my own money when working out of town. When it came to being reimbursed Belcan employees would not help fill out the forms for reimbursement. Almost as if they wanted you to give up on trying to claim your expenses. If you absolutely need a job, work for them. If you have opportunity elsewhere, run. It was work Absolutely no benefits. Part time remote work, issues with firewall restrictions Remote work was great, sometimes access to required information to the job was hard to get, due to firewall restrictions. The freedom to work the hours I wanted was fantastic. Good Work Life Balance for Aviation Industry I really enjoyed working here and found it to be quite a supportive environment for young engineers. With my young family I was able to archive a good work/life balance. I felt that most leaders wanted to see engineers succeed, and put people into positions where they were best suited and gifted. Benefits were fine, but since I am younger, I did not need to use them much. They did have an educational benefit which was nice. Interesting work with good work life balance Sometimes it was a pain to work from home, but it was doable. Great people. Exciting work. I worked there as a designer. The people were great. The work was fun. The only drawbacks were really the pay and benefits, but that is to be expected there. Fun work environment, but not much room for advancement Fun work environment with solid management, but always felt like you were looking over your shoulder at the end of contract to layed off. Also, not much opportunity for advancement. Relaxed Atmosphere A typical day at work is like a regular office job. Piles of engineers in cubicles. Super laid back atmosphere, most of the time people aren't running around with their hair on fire. Middle management is severely lacking as most managers are old engineers hired from within the aerospace industry who have no idea how to manage people or projects. Pay is low and raises are small, but you will only experience as much stress as you impose on yourself. Set your own schedule, no BS office politics Poor pay, Lack of competent middle management Super unproductive in my experience I interned at the phoenix office. We were hardly ever given work so spent the majority of the time just sitting around doing nothing. And the work that we did have was super tedious and boring. I dont think i learned a single thing during my entire co op. On the plus side, we went remote about halfway through the co-op so we got paid pretty dang well to just sit at home and do whatever we wanted, so that was really nice. Management sucks at communicating, we had to change course so many times in the work that we were doing due to a lack of communication with another Belcan office Pay, a lot of down time a lot of down time, horrible communication Not people first Horrible place to work because they didn’t take a serious threat seriously and instead fired the victims. They were more about profit then people in the end Great benefits and great flexibility Motto people first but definitely not Great company, salary was good, great benefits, opportunities for advancement Belcan was a great place to work. Management was strong and coverage from the Recruiters was always there. We had a strong Administrative staff to support us and our customers. It was a very experienced group of people working at Belcan where everyone was able to focus on their primary job responsibilities, overall it was a great place to be employed, great Healthcare, vacation, paid holidays, etc. 2 Good company Assigned to upcoming job. explained details of pay, time keeping and safety. Management was directed through contracted employer Work place culture was non-stressful Hardest part of the job was dealing with out of town contractors who needed guidance on the aspects and safety pertaining to the task assigned. When you and the workers can go home at the end of each day knowing you accomplished the tasks assigned and all tasks were performed safely. It is a good day. working with them is comfortable None 1 Great if you're independently motivated The management never holds your hand or tells you what do. When you're on site, the responsibility is yours so if you can get work done you'll be fine Independence Little to no communication Great Co-workers/Management but boring work My co-workers and manager were great. They were all supportive for new workers and will help you learn as you are getting used to things. Maternity leave is only a week so thats bad but they do have flexible working hours. Flex hours, great co-workers Short Maternity leave, boring work Good place to work This is a great place to work if you are starting out your career. I had the opportunity to work in Boeing’s Ridley park office. The only problem I had was the low pay, lack of benefits and high turnover. Great environment to work in. Belcan is a great place to work if you like a fast paced project oriented environment. Management team is helpful and provides direction for team members. A lot of work for pay that is not competitive for the industry There was a big shift in focus after owner passed away and company was sold. A lot required and compensation wasn't that great. They did have a good employee recognition program. Work is interesting and environment at office is great. Competitive salaries - challenging work - professional intelligent coworkers - remote work available - consistent with benefits - contract work available - flexible hours Great company N/a Great work/life balance Management is very supportive. Everyone is extremely nice which I need to emphasize. I have worked at many places in my career, and I have never before worked for a company where the kindness and supportiveness is so pervasive throughout the organization. My only grievance would be that the office environment is a bit archaic and lacks the latest in ergonomics. Flexibility Office ergonomics its a job great place to collect a paycheck and do nothing. If you are looking to advance your skills look elsewhere. If you are just looking to sit around and do nothing this is the place for you. Great Place to make a new start or to get ahead in a job field. Great benefits especially if you have a family. You can grow with this company but if your not comfortable with working hard or working every day or getting OT time then this isn't for you. Also great pay especially if you know a certain trade. OT time and OT pay and great benefits and positions for growth and Can be hot in the summer and alot of OT depending on position that your working in. Poor response to COVID Was a good company to work for prior to Covid. Laid off with no warning, days after winning a productivity award. They are posting my Previous job title but when I call about coming back they say I am too experienced! Remote Low pay for experience Used to be good, now not so much Used to be good for new engineers or retirees. Aerospace is down now so, not so good. This company was bought out by new owners and then hit hard times. Not sure about their future. Low stress Low pay Good company with on site training Great company to work for. Alot of experience and opportunities for advancement. On-site training of topics that relate to work. Well stocked vending & break rooms. Flexible work schedule (start-stop times). Great balance of experienced coworkers, on site training for advancement. Contract work meaning fluctuating workloads (funding) Recruiting company No benefits but good response to flexibility with covid but thats due to Bayer enforcing it. Way under paid for the quality and expertise of the work. Minimal holidays off that don't always coincide with Bayersm holiday schedule Steady work Under paid a job you got comfortable in and regress After the acquisition of CDI the place went down hill, incompetent people from CDI taking lead positions at Belcan when they shouldn't have been brought along to Belcan. mediocre place with a blah atmosphere Low compensation, relying on one customer too much. work place was great, I wasn't managed by Belcan but by the company itself, Belcan manger had a very hands off approch The work was great, Belcan left us alone but everything else sucked about them. I worked there for more then 9 months before I met the acct manager for Belcan. Information was passed on very slowly to Belcan employees, we where the last to find out we were being furloughed like the day before it happened. We found out from other contractors. did have a direct supervisor that was Belcan No communication with employees There is nothing good to say about Belcan Management is HORRIBLE. She was one of THE worst managers I've ever worked with. She could only do things 1 way and if you ventured off ...she was not nice. Swears she's a Christian and that she has her boss in her back pocket. The women were very clickish. Felt like I changed schools my senior year of high school and had no friends. Seriously...they would go to lunch and not even ask you. Nice Christmas Party Did I mention that management is horrible? Great place to work, especially as a new grad in engineering I had a great experience working for Belcan until I was furloughed and later terminated as a result of COVID-19. My personal experience was positive and my boss was very encouraging and tried his best to get his team in a position to excel. This was my experience, but it may differ from location to location. Job security (contractors will be laid off before the customer's employees) Job is very stressfull for little pay Working at Belcan as a CSU tech is extremely stressful. Your ticket queues can quickly get out of hand. Everything at Belcan is based off of a metric. When you are expected to work more than one job you will also be required to meet a certain meteric when working your tickets. I think this is counter-intuitive to Belcans belief ""People first."" It just becomes a competition on how fast can you close your ticket. When you get hired at Belcan be expected to work more than one job. You may get hired on as a field tech, but you will be expected to work out of the remote techs queue. All of the tech leads here are doing 3 different jobs; they are in the leadership position, they are working as field technicians, and working out of the remote queue. As a field tech the pay does not match the amount of work you will be required to do. They are dissolving more CSU positions even though the work load is increasing. The benifits are also not great. The deductibles are extremely high, and you only have two options. One is a subsidiary of blue cross blue shield, and the other is one Belcan made up. The one beclan created requires you to pay the full amount of your doctors bills up to $1,200 before insurance will being to cover it. It was cheaper for me to go to the Healthcare market pay a high premium, but only be required to pay a co-pay. The Belcan healthcare benifits would have put me deep in debt. The only plus to here is that they are generous with PTO if you request time off you will usually get it or if you are running late they will work with you. There is a nice work to life Generous PTO, good work-life balance, teamwork pay, benifits, work load, stress Frenedly Interpersonal relationships Not much money, but reapid changes in order of work that keep it interesting. Some management aspects tend to be flown by the seat of coorprates collective pleated pants Great company, salary was good, great benefits, opportunities for advancement Belcan was a great place to work. Management was strong and coverage from the Recruiters was always there. We had a strong Administrative staff to support us and our customers. It was a very experienced group of people working at Belcan where everyone was able to focus on their primary job responsibilities, overall it was a great place to be employed, great Healthcare, vacation, paid holidays, etc. 2 N/a The company was great. I really enjoyed working for them. They made me feel welcomed. The managers are very kind and respectful people. I recommend people to apply Beware..Dont work there You never know what you're building. The engineers are horrible. Constantly changing the schematics. Sabotage is very real here. Honestly I don't think the engineers know what they're doing. Pay but not worth it Where do i start? Not a good place if you want growth They had way to many improvements that needed to be made for their employees that they were not willing to take care of. Definitely a boys club atmosphere was that way since the day I started A job with a lot of security - couldn't go to certain areas without badging privledges Sometimes you had to walk on eggs for fear of being reprimanded by mother company. It just a placement company working for a much larger company and they didn't like 'job shoppers' taking the work away even though it was a necessary evil that Belcan had to be there - there was plenty of work most of the time, especially if you looked for it. Supervisors were pretty flexible easy to obtain time off and such for personal issues Work environment was tense at times Work/life balance is excellent. Management performs the right level of guidance in general. Allows for independent thinking without too much micro-management. The worse part of the job is the office physical environment. The desks and chairs have a very old look and feel to them; the ergonomics leave much to be desired. Flexible work hours, available gym Required to be on site constantly with no opportunity to work remotely Always treated well and felt respected Always treated fair. pay was reasonable. People are polite and respectful of others. Good managers and very helpful. Office and work sites are in good locations. Flexible non The flexibility of hours is great. Awesome place to work. Belcan has been supportive the entire time I have been with them. Hours are flexible, benefits started day 1, and the people are fantastic. When the pandemic started they immediately started looking for ways to have us work from home. Flexible hours Sit at a desk all day Loved working for Resa The most enjoyable part of the job was my manager and coworkers. Also enjoyed the flexibility of my job. The hardest part of my job was the lack of jobs to recruit for. Not a place you would recommend to others The benefits at Belcan were abysmal. I stayed with them because, in the beginning, there was flexible scheduling. The pay started very weak, but after three years it was better. Once the schedule became very rigid. I lost interest. Also, getting paid straight time for overtime should be illegal. Then overtime went away entirely. I would have to do some soul searching if I was offered another position with this firm. Good Place to start a career Good people Good to Average management Decent benefits Sub-par Salary Great opportunities to gain experience Belcan is an outsourcing company, good fit for recent graduates to gain job experience or for semi-retirees looking to leverage previous experience for flexible working time. Flexible. Straight forward. No corporate nonsense. Excellent company for someone who just wants to just get their work done and not worry about team meetings, mandatory fun, or corporate double-talk. As long as the work gets done, you can pretty much do whatever you want. Keep the customer happy, and you will be left gloriously alone by both colleagues and management. It was all ge When ge was done, so were we. One manager at ge got mad at belcan and eventually belcan was gone.they were replaced by another contracting agency who hired many of the same people who worked at Belcan...and we eventually became even more short staffed. Decent pay And benefits Understaffed People First? No, Profits First This is a company where the ""yes man"" does extremely well. The majority of leadership (over 80%) consists of older white men. Concepts like ""innovation"" and ""diversity"" are foreign to them. The benefits are laughable and the overall culture is toxic. Some people get lucky and end up with a team of good people, but that only goes so far. Belcan claims to be an industry leader, but does not compare to REAL industry leaders in terms of culture, benefits, and potential for upward mobility. Good work environment Flexible hours; casual dress; good variety of projects. But I'm sorry I offered this review because Indeed won't let me carry on without at least 150 characters. Great friendly management Wonderful friendly staff willing to do anything to place me in the right job. Managers are always giving me the materials I need to complete my job in a timely manner. a recognized industry leader A global engineering industry leader, I work for BELCAN supporting engineering and technical programs beginning in 1987 coming out of technical college. In 2018 I returned to work for BELCAN supporting the aircraft engine business segment in Cincinnati Ohio. BELCAN believes in a work-life-balance culture that supports my lifestyle. Big Company Belcan has mainly focused on acquiring other companies to gain a bigger market share in the federal contracting space. There's not much room for concern for employees. Company is changing to a less mechanical design corporation The mechanical design work is leaving, there is no one with the right expertise to manage and aquire new business, so I am looking for something more fulfilling. Belcan Contractor at Bayer Crop Science I work as a contractor Biologist for Belcan at Bayer Crop Science. I was told upon hiring that Bayer tended to hire contractors directly to Bayer very quickly, and that I would be getting great experience. I was not told that most contractors work for 5+ years without ever being hired, or that we are only making a fraction of salary compared to most comparable full time roles. There is also no sick leave or vacation available. The management at Belcan is extremely unprofessional. You are undervalued but expected to carry production workloads and be hard working. Good company Good contract engineering firm Contract ended way too early after being pulled by Honeywell. Management was great and reimbursements for personal credit card expenses were expedited quickly"
TikTok|" Fun workplace but too competitive Hi, my experience in this company was nice, I was feeling energetic, enthusiastic and very motivated. They expect a lot from you, you give 100% next time you have to give 110% otherwise you're not working well! They try to compensate this with remuneration, and gifts. However, all you want is progress in your career and in this company even if there are possibilities you have to expose yourself to the maximum give 200% out of 100% because giving everything is not enough until you will burn out because you pushed yourself to the limit for nothing at the end. Because if they need you they use you, when they don't need you any more they will put you aside. You will leave Burnout 100% from here 2 Productive and fun place to work It is a place where everyone belongs - regardless of nationality, ethnicity, gender or socio-economic levels - and offers a vibrant buzzing atmosphere that celebrates trends and embraces diversity. TikTok has become a marketplace for ideas around the globe, transcending boundaries to create a diverse hub of content. Productive and Fun Place to Create Content Tiktok is very engaging and by far one of the better social media platforms to be recognized as a content creator .I love interacting with my followers. Very engaging you have to have 100, 000 to really see any residuals 2 stars What is the best part of working at the company? It used to be the culture. There are no best parts of working here. I guess the best part is you can say you work for TikTok. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? They overwork you, and promise you promotions, or chances to grow. You will put in countless hours on a project, or build out implementation proposals and they overlook you, or take your work and get credit for it. There is constant change to the guidelines on promotions, and how to become a leader, or how to move up a level. They expect you to meet your metrics when there is absolutely no work, and you are rated poorly on your performance reviews because they only look at numbers and not contributions like they say they do. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? The work environment is, you better be friends with management if you want anything to work in your favor. The culture is they don’t care about your life and work life balance. There is no team morale. We don’t talk all day, unless it’s about high volumes in the queues, or what we are doing wrong. There is no team building, conversation, jokes, nothing. You clock in, work in your queue, receive messages from leaders on why your status and numbers are low, micromanaged to the extreme, and then clock out feeling worse than you did clocking in. What is a typical day like for you at the company? We have huddled that are mandatory thag no one ever talks in. We are told the same information as the day before and the same information that is posted in chats. You Terrible Nashville Management For content moderators, this is a high-stress job. You will be expected to meet certain goals that are very difficult to meet. QA expects all moderators to know all rules at all times, but only half of those rules are written down anywhere. QA will create new rules, and count them against you even if you broke them before the rule was created. It's even worse for contractors. Several contractors were let go because they were working two jobs to pay their bills. I was contracted as a team lead. They ended my contract not because of performance problems (my team frequently outperformed all other teams), but because the leads that were not contractors complained about me. It didn't matter that the complaints were unjustified. Total mess don't come here Absurdly bad communication: no one knows what's going on when where or why. No vision beyond user growth. Constantly reorganizing company structure both without prior notice and without after the fact explanation. People leaving in troves (almost 1/2 of marketing team apparently quit) Oppressive culture with people regularly silenced for voicing opinion. Zero transparency for corporate policy. Zero interest in personal or career growth - only interest in what's ""best for the company"" Long, unpredictable working hours, with meetings scheduled around Asia time zones. NOT AN AMERICAN COMPANY! Almost 100% of senior leadership sits in Asia—despite ""headquarters"" being in LA. Total cluster disaster. Go anywhere else! Hey Amazing! This place was the best place to work at. When I started I wasn’t sure if I would be able to make it but here I am, three years later! Flourishing and growing! Social Media Influencer As an influencer, I am a contractor. It's a fun lifestyle and definitely has helped open opportunities to other jobs! Pay is okay, I hear they're going to start paying more through the tiktok pulse program. I am excited for new opportunities. Fun and creative company to work for Very easy to gain followers on here you get paid monthly so you have to wait a while to get your income but it's definitely a great and easy way to make that extra cash. Work at home/fun to do People on the internet can be mean Company doing exceptionally well bu extremely stingy in compensation One of the worst toxic culture I have experienced working in a tech company. The company suffers for cognitive dissonance where its culture byetstyle and so called flat management culture is only company policy on paper. Reality is sourly the opposite. Decisons are still being made in China even for the smallest aspects. Alot of management in Dublin are simply spinless yes men and women and many are actually very incompetent and hardly aware of the basics of the projects they manage. 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Creative outlet What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Payouts are hard to get Minimum paid raise A lot of great people to work with, managers are nice, but there is no pay transparency and it's very difficult to get pay raise despite the inflation. Smart, passionate coworkers; terrible management; no paths for advancement The people who work there are intelligent, ambitious, passionate, and dedicated. The work is exciting. But the company is severely understaffed; the organizational structure keeps changing; mid-level managers have no idea what they’re doing; and top-level managers are too busy to assess or train their direct reports. The work-life balance is the worst most people have ever experienced, even at a tech start-up, with the majority working 14+ hours each weekday plus Sunday afternoons and evenings. The culture is TikToksic. Fast growth company with lots of opportunity. Good pay and perk. It is hard to working with the peers in difference time zone. I base in LA, due to pandemic lock down, we were working from home, I start my working day at 8:30, I talk to my colleague in NY and Sao paulo in the earlier morning. I also prefer to deal with ""system job"" or work out my daily work plan before 10:30; Usually, I cascade down some task to team and spend some time with my team to make sure they crystal clear understand the ""in and out"" of task and get sufficient resource and support to accomplish their job. I always get take advantage of lunch break to do some exercise (Go to gym or 7-8 mil running) before 2 pm, My schedule always pile up with lots of meeting. From 6 pm - 8 pm it is time to liaise with my counterpart in Beijing. Toxic working environment toxic working environment, gaslighting occurs regularly, leadership right now is lacking. while the salary can be considered competitive, the company isn't at a stage right now to be able to foster a safe place to work. Good pay if you want to hustle and deal with frustration The compensation and a big name on your resume may be the only good part of this job. The actual work was boring and confusing, not applicable to future roles, and overall lacked training or direction causing immense frustration. Working with a global team and dealing with time zones since majority based in China is also a headache. tik tok Tik Tok is a fun new innovative app that allows you to share your ideas through video clips put together. I like to make them during my free time because it is fun Interesting place to work Working there it's like hanging around your family. It's a free-for-all you can do whatever you want. Go play bingo then come back Go to the beach then come back Lunch Lunch Not an amazing company Where do I start.... Moderation teams have awful schedules. We are asked to work on a rotational basis and cover different shifts (yes, like any other vendor). Oh, and forget about thinking on holidays in the within 2 -3 months because you don't how your schedule is gonna look like by then. Onboarding was poor and nothing close to what you really do in a daily basis. I spent more time in the general onboarding with icebreaker and ""fun"" activities, than in the training for the job I was hired for, and when I went live I noticed how poor the training for my role had been. Many people is so confused about the processes but I don't blame the moderators because things in the company are new and constantly changing. It is super messy. The daily tasks are boring and repetitive, nothing amazing. There is a lot of hype for this company but honestly it is like any other badly structure company or like any other vendor in terms of work life balance. Benefits, salary, people Schedules, management Jskw was very nice welcoming nice good people Yes Remote work (also known as work from home [WFH] or telecommuting) is a type of flexible working arrangement that allows an employee to work from remote location outside of corporate offices. Toxic culture & no work life balance Tiktok is an exciting place to work but is probably not going to be anyone’s long term home, unless you enjoy being overworked, underpaid and under-appreciated.

Do not recommend, but I can only speak regarding the Nashville office. Job is boring and staffing agency is misleading. a typical day at work what you learned management workplace culture the hardest part of the job the most enjoyable part of the job Work from Home. No benefits and terrible schedules. 10 2 Fun place to work at I really enjoyed the environment if the place. I definitely don’t regret working there. I never felt stressed or anything like that. Great company in my opinion. Free lunch 1 7 It will drain you Stayed there for almost 3 years. If you are a hard worker. They'll take advantage of that and rely everything in you. Even things outside your scope. It'll feel rewarding at first but not worth it for the pay. Advancement is doable but expect not to get a raise. There's a high attrition rate especially on the leadership side. The backfills for these positions do not care about people at all. Seems like institutional knowledge is not valued by the new management. High in work place politics. It's very apparent that no one trusts anyone. Health and dental benefits are pretty decent. See review above. Great experience Learning a lot about the earl life scenarios. Management works great from top to bottom. Work life balance is maintained. Not a stressful job. Would recommend all Amazing opportunity If you're in college, become a campus rep! BEST program ever. Significant pay, amazing management and flexible times to complete your work. Also opportunities to advance your career. Compensation and hours None No life balance and weak management There is a severe management lack of experience and work hours are insane range from 12 and above a day and be ready to work weekends. Also no career path or personal growths. No life balance Fun workplace, office is cool, management is meh I loved the people I worked with but management didn't have social skills, they can't communicate or even look you in the eye when talking to you. You never know what's going on, so you literally find out about things through the news. Free lunch, cool office They take themselves too serious, didn't feel there was room to advance. Fast pace working environment Fast pace working environment, competitive pay, everything moves pretty quickly here. Culture is dependent on which team you are on. Overall team working really efficiently. Good to learn good benefits, free canteen, gym, snacks. easy to learn, lesson good environment, and culture no work-life balance need to speed up your own life to survive free lunch, dinner short breaks Great Place to Work TikTok provides you with all the skills and items you need to be successful. They give merchandise to help promote their brand on campus and have a great work-life balance ideal. It is always fun to create content for assignments and they pair you up with other representatives as well. Fun Culture Fun place to work Innovative and creative place to work. To be different at TikTok is to be valued. Every person is pushed to think outside the box and work as a team. They are fine I think the company is a little sloppy at times with goals that are near unreachable, although outside of that they are fine and mean well in most of their endeavors Fun workplace but too competitive Hi, my experience in this company was nice, I was feeling energetic, enthusiastic and very motivated.

Productive and Fun Place to Create Content Tiktok is very engaging and by far one of the better social media platforms to be recognized as a content creator .I love interacting with my followers. Very engaging you have to have 100, 000 to really see any residuals 2 stars What is the best part of working at the company? It used to be the culture. There are no best parts of working here. I guess the best part is you can say you work for TikTok. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? They overwork you, and promise you promotions, or chances to grow. You will put in countless hours on a project, or build out implementation proposals and they overlook you, or take your work and get credit for it. There is constant change to the guidelines on promotions, and how to become a leader, or how to move up a level. They expect you to meet your metrics when there is absolutely no work, and you are rated poorly on your performance reviews because they only look at numbers and not contributions like they say they do. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? The work environment is, you better be friends with management if you want anything to work in your favor. The culture is they don’t care about your life and work life balance. There is no team morale. We don’t talk all day, unless it’s about high volumes in the queues, or what we are doing wrong. There is no team building, conversation, jokes, nothing. You clock in, work in your queue, receive messages from leaders on why your status and numbers are low, micromanaged to the extreme, and then clock out feeling worse than you did clocking in. What is a typical day like for you at the company? We have huddled that are mandatory thag no one ever talks in. We are told the same information as the day before and the same information that is posted in chats. You Terrible Nashville Management For content moderators, this is a high-stress job. You will be expected to meet certain goals that are very difficult to meet. QA expects all moderators to know all rules at all times, but only half of those rules are written down anywhere. QA will create new rules, and count them against you even if you broke them before the rule was created. It's even worse for contractors. Several contractors were let go because they were working two jobs to pay their bills. I was contracted as a team lead. They ended my contract not because of performance problems (my team frequently outperformed all other teams), but because the leads that were not contractors complained about me. It didn't matter that the complaints were unjustified. Total mess don't come here Absurdly bad communication: no one knows what's going on when where or why. No vision beyond user growth.

They expect a lot from you, you give 100% next time you have to give 110% otherwise you're not working well! They try to compensate this with remuneration, and gifts. However, all you want is progress in your career and in this company even if there are possibilities you have to expose yourself to the maximum give 200% out of 100% because giving everything is not enough until you will burn out because you pushed yourself to the limit for nothing at the end.

Blizzard Entertainment|" Great Company Culture Blizzard was definitely a positive impact in my life and my courier. The company is well organized, respectful to employees and offers amazing benefits. Benefits Work weekend 4 Amazing work environment, team and culture, low pay My experience was incredible, and I’m absolutely thankful to have been able to work there, but the pay for the cost of living when they expected us to return to office was just far too low for the exponential rise in rent in SoCal. Ultimately decided to go back to school, wish I could have stayed but I don’t want to struggle to pay my bills for the rest of my life. Low pay, low advancement opportunities Pay was horribly low. Culture was fun for awhile, but soon the bad outweighed the good. Absolutely no advancement opportunity; a single position would open every couple years. Challenging and abusive customers, high volume, and high metric expectations. No family balance; having children was borderline impossible due to being required to work weekends or nights with no leeway. Okay for a starter job, but don't expect to make a career out of it. 0 stars if I could Blizzard is a hack company that doesn't deserve business or your hard earned cash. They'll just lock you out of your account and leave you nothing. Honestly to see how far this company has fallen is tragic. At the very least I was hoping to keep playing games I payed for, but even that wasn't possible. Seeking refunds for my purchases. none Dont ever work here It's as bad as all the other people say. Don't come in thinking you're gunna enjoy work every day. It's a business that does not care about the customer or the employees. Bad company This company doesn't care about its employees, it clearly doesn't care about the customers, I've seen it in almost every game, they false advertise their games, and release half the game upon official release, they openly screw customers over let alone the employees. I have no words or memory/recollection of the last time ANYBODY was satisfied with this company, to a point where there wasn't even question if this company has redeemed itself for its uncalled for, bad service and lack of care towards ANYTHING. It was fun while the experience lasted but never would I ever again. I could write a few detailed chapters of all the things that are wrong with this place but everyone’s experience is their own and if that’s a risk you want to take to find out, so be it :) Some of the people you meet there can be enjoyable, small merch perks Difficult to advance in career, Low compensation for industry, Lack of management skills from many managers/leads, They hire from a temp agency, They have several temps yet don’t treat them the same as their employees but make them do more work. Too many knuckleheads in charge I worked for Blizzard for six long years. It started off great until the culture completely changed. What you read in the newspaper is true and what is worse, there are people like that still waiting in the shadows. Work here if you are a fan of the once great company, it will look good on your resume. Good work life balance The stories you read online and the newspaper are just the tip of the iceberg... it is much worse Blizzard had incredible employee care and TONS of FREE Stuff/Events, but its still a Call Center and your job will revolve around the customers There are two sides to working at Blizzard, and which side is more important to you will determine if you have a good time there. First is the company/culture itself. My time was from 2012-2016 and I only left because I had to (moved), I didnt want to leave. The company side loves to make its employees feel like they matter. Some of these things are like: Usually 2 big events (outings) in the year where they rent out places (like an entire Main Event or Dave & Busters), and 2-4 events where they provide food and drinks with 60-90 mins to check out some ""stuff"" (cant say per NDA), and plenty PotLucks, team outings, and even time to play the current games/expansions so we are up to date on the in-game knowledge to better help our players. Being a Call Center, you can dress how you want, you can eat at your desk whenever (but you cant leave the desk unless your on lunch/break/bathroom). I personally kept snacks in my bottom drawer. During my time there, the place was fun and very great. However the otherside of this coin is the actual work itself. Its a call center, so your usually juggling either Phones, Live Chat, or ""Tickets"" (email support basically). Tickets are usually your most relaxing time as you can listen to music/podcasts, just cant be watching movies/shows. Make sure your still working and meeting metrics, and Ticket time is the best time. Phones are a loot box. Sometimes you get cool people, sometimes VERY upset people, and sometimes people who dont know what a keyboard is. its a grab bag but thats part of the job. Live chat however, is where it gets very stressful. Great work experience Place encourages learning and developing their employees, fellow employees were great people, and enjoyed the job. Major con is the pay, but the work was easy. Always looked to promote from within. It’s just another 9-5 job I had always heard how great Blizzard was in it’s prime. However, under the Activision umbrella, it felt the same as any other job I’ve worked in. The was a strong sense of favoritism when it came to advancement and raises. If you weren’t available for every event and knew how to placate to the right people, there wasn’t much of a future or growth in the company. Nice people, decent pay, benefits available Too many meetings, management is not reliable, designers / dev do not take feedback Very political Not a good place to work. Current news on the company should be all you need to know. Horrible culture and hardly any opportunity for advancement. The company likely won't be around much longer. Started out great. Declined once politics became involved. Good co-workers, poor management tactics to keep pay low All of my co-workers were nice, good people, and I got along well with them. There were, however, a lot of barriers to a promotion that did not seem merit-based. There is some validity to California's suit against Blizzard for having a frat-boy environment. Blizzard management also used their name brand as being compensation in itself to pay their QA Department (and likely Customer Service Department) less than a livable wage. Free overtime food, relaxed environment and dress code Low pay, promotion favoritism, too much overtime Great place to work overall Very supportive. Great projects. World renowned company. Need a little more focus on innovations. Software infrastructure has gotten overly complicated over the years, since there were so many projects and each project was unique. Pay is ""low"" b/c of the ""Blizzard tax"" -- everyone wants to work there, so they don't have to pay as much. Great projects to work on if you are on a game team. Plenty of perks. Free lunches during ""crunch"". Some managers weren't good, their infrastructure has become overly complicated since there are so many projects. They ask for your thoughts on something and why you think that thenwonder why you are all over the place? Its not fair. Being there for 5+ years and told that I could come back to work make sure you get it in writing like I should have when I left ON GOOD TERMS,I wish I did. They love and appreciate good work. I left due to illness figuring that if I left on good terms it would be better so that I could concentrate on getting well to getting healthier. The HR lady said that I would be able to work again and my time would take up where it left off as if I had never left and my time there had never had been interrupted and then I could start working towards getting my shield that would go with my sword that I already have. Blizzard is a large dysfunctional family that I love and I miss so I want to get back in there ASAP. I can hardly wait! Free lunches, free gear, meeting new people, opportunities Short breaks, having to learn to adjust to things you normally abhor (certain odors, music, etc.) Losing core and identity Slowly losing company values while parent company is making more decisions. There are many cases of people getting promotions due to a spot opening, but they don’t fit criteria. Then others with the criteria are sidelined. Most employees genuinely do care and are great to work woth Low pay, corporate when it saves money but relaxed/carefree in places it should be more corporate Don't Do It This is an absolutely horrible place to work. Unless you are willing to go out drinking with the managers after hours or publicly berate others or simply keep quiet when you see people doing unsavory things, you would not fit in here. The pay is not commensurate with professional experience, but instead, experience with either flirting with senior directors or going to party with them. If you are willing to wear tight clothes, you might be promoted. So many. Where do I start? A sinking ship / all-time low morale This is not easy to write as Blizzard has always been my dream company and I am a huge fan of their games, but the company is a sinking ship. Been with them for a few years and the first year was amazing and exceeded all expectations for what one imagined what life at Blizzard would be like. But in 2020 it all started to go downhill due to constant changes and overreach from Activision. It sounds good on paper: they are trying to streamline things across the global company but the vision is unclear and implementation is horrendous. Certain decisions coming from the top (c-suite) make no sense with no explanation and I’ve seen it drive people out in droves. It’s heartbreaking for me to note that everyone I know at the company has left or is actively looking for a new job. And these are people who bleed blizzard-blue and never dreamed of leaving! And don’t get me started on the horrendous practice of hiring everyone as a contractor and extending their contract every three months with the promise of conversion. Contract life is cruel when you are forced to work 18+ months without access to benefits or PTO. No matter how you try to beg/convince upper management that you need to convert someone, it can never be done. And those who are hired as full-time are paid insultingly low. It’s impossible to hire great talent if we are unable to pay them competitive rates. I’m depressed to see such a great company fall but all I can do now is appreciate that I was able to experience the good times and hopefully bring that inspiration to my next job Great team members, fun products, D&I employee networks Horrible corporate leadership and management, rushing new process/tech implementations which has created chaos, everyone is leaving The People are better than the company My experience with this company is two fold. I enjoyed my coworkers, but not the woke PC culture that tended to permeate the management culture. My coworkers were very awesome people. The kind of people you'd like to game and chill with after work. The only problem, is that we were all tired from work and usually didn't hang out. The people I worked with were the best thing about working at this employer. The company itself and the lack of morality where it counts, tended to be the worst part of working for this employer. Good coworkers The company allows for the censorship of individuals in communist countries, while pushing a woke agenda globally Great culture, but lack of growth First let me start off with stating I am not disgruntled. Quite the contrary. Blizzard Entertainment helped shape me into the type of employee I am today. The people I worked with every day made the workload digestible. The workload however is mundane and highly repetitive. It wouldn't change very much from the day to day life. Show up and clock in. Send the same responses countless times for the same reason/requests. The biggest thing I learned there was how to communicate effectively. Unfortunately, that didn't help with advancing in the company. They will say that you own your career, however you get locked in one department and have little opportunity from moving out of that department. The pay scale was absolutely abysmal when I started. However several employees made a huge fuss about being underpaid and they bumped everyone up to a more suitable pay band. Close enough to a living wage as you'll get currently for an entry level position. You'll still need a roommate or two to offset living expenses. Management is going to be hit or miss. It ultimately depends on if you get along with them and become friends. But if you direct supervisor doesn't like you personally, you'll have a bad time working there. Upper management was completely out of touch with reality by the time I left. They were so focused one profitability and money, they lost sight of the company's mission. To provide an epic gaming experience with epic customer support. They found that automated support is more cost effective than having the human element. Decent pay, great benefits, great culture, tons of free stuff no room for advancement Blizzard died long ago Once Blizzard merged with Activision, its culture died off. Game Masters were met with extremely low pay and terrible working hours. Morale is low, every manager was essentially demoted and forced to work tickets on the floor. The company doesn't care about its customer service department or most of its developers. Benefits are okay, but constant fear of layoffs and constant hiring freezes keep everyone with a negative outlook. You essentially get paid in Blizzard swag and then its taxed as taxable income. The old Blizzard is long gone. Steer clear of this place. Pay, benefits, hours, morale Great Company Culture Blizzard was definitely a positive impact in my life and my courier. The company is well organized, respectful to employees and offers amazing benefits. Benefits Work weekend 4 Once great now lost Blizzard was a superb creative-driven company. ""It will ship when it's ready"" was the motto. Now Activision has turned it into a heartless money-driven shop. 1 Stable and Stagnant The legendary reputation this company had for being an amazing place to work no longer exists. The work/life balance is good, and is appropriate if you have a family to support. However this is just another huge corporation that operates as such, and not the small family atmosphere it once was. This will all depend on the team your placed with. I’ve heard being directly on a game team is most fun, and everything else will be miserable. Career growth is non-exisistent, as you will only excel if you have the proper alliances or leave and come back (very typical way of climbing the corporate ladder). If you seek professional growth, I would advise to look elsewhere. If you need a steady paycheck, they have plenty of revenue. Just mentally prepare yourself for the brain drain. Swag Poor Management, Lack of Career Growth 1 Steer clear, you don't want to work here Horrible company, bad ethics and bad morals. Upper management has zero spine since the Activision merger. The Blizzard culture has been completely destroyed for many years now. abusive Blizzard does not care about their employees. They are one of a number of companies who treat people like equipment. They're also the kind of company to judge people by superficial demographics instead of merit or character. They don't care about people, which is a problem because the company and the customers are all people. At the end of the day, that's all there is. Amazing work campus Blizzard has a top notch facility, on site cafe, food trucks, gym, yoga, massage, volleyball court, basketball court, continuing education, library for digital and print media, and doctor visits. Their culture is super laid back but at the same time everyone puts their 110% forward. exciting I was interviewed on Skype for the job as a Concept Artist and got selected for a short term job. I was part of a team of of 18 people. I got a lot of experience working with such a popular studio we have. Productive and fun workplace its the video game industry I really enjoyed the culture of the job as it fit who I am especially with one of their core values of ""Embrace Your Inner Geek"" which is to be yourself and that is something I think is important that we all have lives outside our work and to remember many people have similar interests and its not a negative thing. Good environment but no opportunity for growing Any special events, traininigs, or opportunities offered by Blizzard are only to those that are permanent employees not contractors. Meeting qouta is strictly pushed and those not meeting it are at risk of getting laid off. Good food, nice coworkers, good pay Incredible culture, incredible people, and always a new challenge! Blizzard has always been one to put culture at the forefront of what they do. By allowing, and acknowledging, that every single employee brings something unique to the table, Blizzard has always been a place where sharing ideas and promoting open communication comes easy. This is the driving factor for me staying with the company for such an extended period of time. As for the next best thing? It's their ability to never accept the status quo as the norm. Blizzard is always looking for ways to raise the bar for both the employee and customer facing sides of the business. This has lead to a workplace where the ability to adapt to change and consistently learn & grow is crucial to success. There is not a day that goes by where the job doesn't provide a new challenge or experience. Fun working environment As the Facilities Manager I manage a professional team of individuals that assist me with the maintenance team, and facilities for all of our national retail locations. Amazing company Blizzard is a great company to work for. They are really good to their employees, and their benefits are amazing! I would definitely recommend becoming part of the Blizzard family if given the opportunity. Life changing and full of joy The most enjoyable part of the job is learning upcoming features and working together as team to make the game better. The culture was great, I never felt ignored. Great company to work for, care about their employees, work/life balance is great. Blizzard is a very good company to be at, the experience gained is invaluable and they deeply care about their employees and communities. Managers give their team room to flex and be themselves. Hardest part about blizzard is that while they try to promote within, moving around different teams is hard and there aren't a lot of programs supporting that culture, so to move up, it's likely that you must leave for that experience. Productive and overall great place to work. Creative environment with a lot of resources and freelancers, I have always felt that Blizzard Delivers a high level of service and make the highest quality projects. Nice environment It was a very nice environment, with great coworkers.quick and easy to understand assignments specially for big events such as blizz con. Would really recommend this to people Fun place to work but doesn't pay Working at Blizzard can be a double edged sword. It is a fun place to work, but you will not make near what your peers make outside the company. Blizzard recognizes this, but just consider it a part of working for them. Great Place to Work The people you work with day to day are amazing, it is a great company to work for and you have a great time doing what you do. The perks are great too. Time spent working for people who hate you. Blizzard has inside political ideologies, if they find out you don't fit their world view they will attempt to manage you out, if that fails they let you sit in stagnation with no opportunity to move up or transfer to other departments. Good benefits otherwise. Fun co-workers. Clueless managers who are obscenely out of touch. Activision screwed up a good company when they bought Blizzard. I had heard about how great it was to work for Blizzard for years from a friend of mine that worked there. Unfortunately for me, by the time I got there Activision had already sunk it's claws into Blizzard. Basically, the Activision bean counters took over and turned a good company with a positive soul into just another company without a soul. Cool place to work, but you work for less. Everyone wants to work at Blizzard, which means, they do not have to pay as much to get employees. It is a cool place to work, but on the downside, team inclusion can be difficult, depending on the personalities you work with. This is regardless of your race/gender/preferences. HR is poor at helping employees with complaints. Occasional free lunches, bonuses, great work environment Poor pay, Activision, game teams only respected teams Great Company Culture Blizzard was definitely a positive impact in my life and my courier. The company is well organized, respectful to employees and offers amazing benefits. Benefits Work weekend 4 Highly Recommend, but very Situational Within Blizzard, there are many different groups and sub-groups. Many of them hold very different dynamics, but overall, Blizzard is a great place to work. 1 2 Blizzard Entertainment was incredible, highly recommend. Incredible people, incredible executive staff and overall amazing place. It has so many amenities and privileges. No where else has a so many Corgis in one place! 3 8 Great people. Tough work load. Very meeting heavy and poor work/life balance. People are amazing to work with and the culture is enjoyable. Lots of perks provided but tough to take advantage when you work all the time. A Fine Place for Ambitious People Blizzard is a fine place for outstanding people. The atmosphere is ""implicitly competitive"" -- relaxed and welcoming, but hunger for praise is rewarded. Blizzard is the most supportive and stable environments in the video game industry. Some disciplines are under-represented at a team level. Support for cultural diversity is strong. Growth Encouraged, Nerd Culture, Diversity, Casual Workplace Stress, Transparency, Strategy Great all around working environment Worked there for a limited period in my life and left due to school. But truly amazing hard working individuals and I am glad to have said that I was apart of this team at one point. Very little ""CRUNCH"" time when it came to game releases Worked on a project for months and had it eventually scrapped What other gaming companies should strive to be Typical day consisted of answering numerous emails and tickets, and going in and out of meetings. I improved upon myriad work skills, from Microsoft Office suite products, to time management. I learned a great deal about hardware and software, asset management, contract negotiation, software compliance and more. My managers were all wonderful, and I would love to work for any of them again. The culture is unique in how much passion everyone held for the products that were released. The hardest part of the job was managing last minute ""fire drill"" type requests. The most enjoyable part was working with a company I have admired since I was a kid. Blizzard Blizzard is a great place to work. Fun projects, great people, great benefits in Irvine, CA. The hard work pays off when you see the worlds you have created and the audiences you entertained. Great Benefits, great projects Little work/life balance Not the best time to ask Was part of the ""Blizzard 800"" group that was laid off in Feb 2019. Did not expect to be let go. Many folks who were laid off had been there for many years and were dedicated and talented. Blizzard is a great company to work for Working in Blizzard CS has been a pleasure. The company believes in its core values and uses those to drive everything that it does. Within CS we have driven ourselves to be the best in our industry and in Customer Service in general. We may sometimes make the wrong decisions but we learn from our mistakes and move forward. We accept that mistakes will be made and we encourage everyone to learn from them. That is why Blizzard has moved the needle on what is expected from a game companies CS. Blizzard forever set the bar for Company Culture Never before have I worked at such a fun company who truly embraced and embodied their core values, as posted on their website. Even though I was working in a call center taking support calls, we were still a part of the company and got a lot of the perks. If it weren't for the low paycheck, people would stay forever, and many had been there for many years even when I got there. If you ever get the chance to apply for Blizzard, I highly recommend it, despite recent struggles and the second, recent round of layoffs. It is full of incredible people and geeks and nerds from all walks of life. They take care of their employees, and while the opportunity for advancement is very challenging (because everyone STAYS there!), it is absolutely worth the experience. Being a part of such a cool gaming company that lives and breathes its amazing culture The support staff were paid a low hourly wage Customer Service Representative at major Video Game Company Work 4 hours taking tickets. Have an hour long lunch. Then another 4 hours of tickets. Co-workers are fun and enjoyable to talk to. The company pays low but expects high quality. The incentive is that there's a certain prestige for working for Blizzard. Working for a Video Company Micro-management, constant change in expectations, no room for advancement Hello I'm just typing this here to get past the required number of characters so that I can continue with what I was working on. 150 characters is more than I thought. good enough. Looking for a 13 dollar an hour job in Austin working customer service? Laid back place to work, metrics are EASY to reach if you're not an idiot. No drug test, no hassles. Show up, do your job, and enjoy all the perks of working with Blizzard. Fun place to work Blizzard is heavy on gaming culture. The place feels more like college than an actual job. This leads to people staying around longer than most companies, which ends up bottle-necking advancement. The company pays low but expects high quality. The incentive is that there's a certain prestige for working for Blizzard. I'm just trying to skip these reviews I'm not a writer, so I am not up for writing all of these reviews for public scrutiny (I should've misspelled that one, huh? Just to see if anyone caught it). Foundation is cracking - used to be amazing Blizzard was a dream company to work for a few years ago. Since then, there has been a great deal of change. It is still a great company, but there is a very high risk that this will slowly decline over the next few years with recent movement. That being said, there is also a chance it will bounce back better than ever with fresh perspective and new blood. If you're open to the risk, stop on by - you might love it! If you are looking for steady security, wait a bit before considering Blizzard. Great benefits, gorgeous campus with amenities, employees are excellent humans and professionals See above Working for a legendary game studio Within my 9 years of service, Blizzard Customer Support has grown into a well-organized, intelligently-run department. In my role, I was given a lot of opportunities to make a difference in the organization. It wasn't always easy, but my teammates made it much more bearable. I left the company happy and in a position to pursue other options safely. Given the right set of circumstances, would absolutely rejoin the Blizzard family. It's a great company and culture to work in. The people I worked with were great. At least in Customer Support, the hours can be rough on personal life, since the need for our presence covers all hours Fun and Amazing company People are great, laid back culture, everyone can grow and learn new things. It's a fun workplace environment with endless opportunities to connect and develop meaningful relationships. Blizzard Entertainment is an awesome place to work I have been working with Blizzard Entertainment for a while now and they take very good care of their employees, vendors, and guests that come to the sites. They have great incentive plans and all employees enjoy working for the company. bring dog to work, wear whatever clothing I want to wear Nothing that I have found so far. Fun Fun place to work. Blizzard is family oriented and you get decent swag and perks. Unfortunately they have a compensation problem that they refuse to fix so they are bleeding top talent to competitors. Great Company Culture Blizzard was definitely a positive impact in my life and my courier. The company is well organized, respectful to employees and offers amazing benefits. Benefits Work weekend 4 Fantastic culture and great place to work I've been at Blizzard for over a decade and I've truly enjoyed my entire time here. It's helped me grow immensely, even beyond my current role, and provided me numerous challenges and opportunities along the way. The benefits are outstanding and the pay is fair. The people are what has really made this company feel like home over the past decade. I would truly recommend it to anyone as a fantastic place to work and an opportunity to look for. 5 6 Great place to work for the experienced Pros: - Great workplace with a lot of passion - Much more casual and nerdy - Awesome job stability with good benefits and nice compensations/discounts - It's Blizzard! Cons: - Like all game companies: less pay and lots of overtime. High passion & dedication are expected - Promotions are difficult; better to leave and gain more experience elsewhere, then reapply back - You're required to work Blizzcon (once a year 2-day convention) - Inter-department communication isn't great; many teams have a very solo mentality. 6 Good placer to work Good place to work. Boss is more like a mentor than a boss. He carries the load with you and doesn't hesitate for a second to stop and help you if you are struggling. He will do anything in his power to keep you productive but not overwhelmed and he is very understanding. The job is not easy, lots of complains and situations you wish you could say ""just play the game and use google"" since we need to solve ""how to do quests"" situations to players and World of Warcraft has a few thousand quests. Other than that, the job was not fun but the bosses were so cool that you don't mind the work at all. No wonder these guys are so famous for Customer Service. Higher pay rate for CS Contracts come and go based on the game they are releasing, once the game is out and settled they will let every new CS go. Amazing. Amazing people, amazing company. Every team has their own culture. The most enjoyable part of the job was the daily interaction with fellow artist and coworkers. Not Bad But Over-Hyped I have worked at Blizzard Entertainment for close to eleven years in Customer Support. Though the job itself is full of introverts and encourages you to focus on your work, it is the extroverts that receive all the promotions. They do promote from within but any degrees earned, past experience, time already worked at Blizzard, none of that matters. You get one shot via an interview for positions that you may wait years for an opening to come up in and if you have any kind of interview anxiety, you will not get that promotion. Working in Support is a nightmare. Most of the people who work there for any kind of extended time end up with neurological disorders. We have military vets that did fine in combat that end up with anxiety, we have a large number of people that end up dealing with depression. You face customers that dehumanize you, scream at you, and basically hold your career hostage through the almighty survey system. These are customers that are basically addicts to video games and if you have ever dealt with an addict that is denied their fix, then you have an idea of how they can be. There are often Staff that cry on the job from the sheer amount of abuse that they take from customers and because we have to sweet talk even the most meanest customer for a better survey rather than tell them what actually needs to be said, you have to ignore the constant fight or flight instinct telling you to either run from this customer or fight back. I do not care how mentally strong you are, you ignore this for too long, and your body and your mind will strike back at you. Free products, great benefits Low pay, entitled customers, terrible metric system, terrible promotion system, unavoidable and unreasonable amounts of unecessary stress, out of touch management, promotions given to extroverts and work cliques Overall fun place to work This is a fun place to work. Everyone generally gets along with everyone else. The culture is awesome and I couldn’t ask for a better place of employment. I hope to remain there for years to come. Able to bring pets to work, benefits, company discounts, we have our own Starbucks!! Nothing. Great people to work with I have never felt so welcomed on a first day. Staff is very fun to work with, laid back and get the job done. Everyone loves their job and is very nice to each other. Staff is treated very well. Downside is that it is only part-time. Free lunch on event days, stocked kitchen, fun environment. part-time, on call. Great place to work I had a great time learning from my peers. Everyone there is friendly and what a great culture to be a part of. The best part of working at Blizzard is the people you work with. Let your inner geek out Everything Pay inst the best Fun business to work for Between Customer Service and Tester, the work place was a very relaxed place of business. Many hours were spent working with customers to bring resolution to their said issues. Plenty of opportunities to make more than your base pay Mandatory over time in excess can be taxing Wonderful place to start! If you love W.O.W. this is definitely the place to work. I loved my job so much when I started. The people I worked with were wonderful, and most of them were really accommodating to my situation. I went here right out of high school and the only reason I left was because the pay didn't meet my needs as an adult trying to move out. Loved every second of the job, just wish they paid more. Blizzard Ent Typical work day consist of pulling tickets and resolving customers' issue. Tickets are resolved in a timely manner. What I learned was how to work with a team and always ask questions if needed. Management was average I never talked to my team manager because he quit the day I hit the floor. Workplace culture was fun. We all work in a office and talk to each other occasionally on breaks and lunch. Hardest part of the job is having to deal with irate customers who is stubborn to listen to your recommendation. Most enjoyable part of the job would working at the cube and listening to music or podcast while resolving tickets. relaxed work enviroment underpaid, no career advancement Great place but depends on which team/dept I think the department I was in was just bad. Bad upper management who gossips and tells other staffs compensation...he just didn’t know how to actually guide the department as a whole. The rest of Blizzard has many intelligent and hard working people. I love the company and projects we work on but I guess the department just didn’t work for me. Overall Good Experience From an Overall perspective working in the Customer Support department at Blizzard was a good experience. I appreciated the day-to-day interactions that I had with the leadership, and my peers. Like many places, you will get out of it what you put into it. Great work place to work Blizzard Entertainment is a great place to work, and I would recommend it for anyone (entry level to senior level). The company takes time and listen to employee feedback as it does with player feedback, and that's huge. Excellent benefits, company cultures Salary can be more competitive Love it Loved my time with Blizzard and my Blizzard family. They treated us great. I was sad to leave but life happens and it happened here so It was time to move on Great company HORRIBLE employer Experienced engineers were required to punch a time clock. Management was completely inept, poor treatment of women, extremely low pay, high turnover. Managers haze new employees and will yell in meetings. Human resources is NOT an advocate for the employee. Long hours and NO recognition for the work done. Blizzard games are awesome Inept management, very poor environment Smoke and mirrors People see the public image of Blizzard. The real internal image is like a butcher shop. People like the products, but don’t want to see how it is made. Arrogant managers, directional challenge directors and VP is the foundation. It is the passive aggressive you expect from the cliche movies. Managers don’t know how to motivate, mentor(makes them look bad), or manage people. The workers spend 75% playing than actually working because the company pays you 75% of the job market. HR has to send out reminders to all employees of hygiene requirements. Free alcohol The people you work with Great Culture, No love for temp QA It's great if you are hired full time but if you are contract QA they will pull the contract early. Lots of office politics and people playing WoW during work shifts. Temp QA picked up a lot of the slack but were harassed by full timers. Sad experience for such a great company. We were brought on and told after a year we'd be hired full time and then laid off after blizzcon. perks office politics, non commitment, deceit Good! I would not say the best place i worked but one of the best because of the other workers too they was to much helpful too me when i was wrong to something or my manager he helped me a lot! Good, collaborative work place. I definitely would recommend it for anyone interested in getting into the art field. It is a great entry level job, but there isn't much opportunity for career advancement. Great Company Culture Blizzard was definitely a positive impact in my life and my courier. The company is well organized, respectful to employees and offers amazing benefits. Benefits Work weekend 4 Best Summer Internship I could ask for I interned at Blizzard Entertainment in summer 2017. Right off the bat, I got to do work which mattered to me and inspired me, and talk to incredibly smart and passionate people with various backgrounds and journeys in life. More importantly, I felt that I was greatly appreciated for my work and who I was as a person all throughout my time, and I had never felt so fulfilled before. I would 100% recommend this internship and company again, and again, and again. Work culture, smart and passionate people, Blizzard games Lack of communication between departments, duplicate work 4 2 Productive and fun place to work - Good place to learn and grow. - A company that is always leading the charge to the future. - Leader in E-sports. - Team cooperation and cohesion are excellent. Free Blizzard Games, Free BlizzCon Ticket. N/a 4 Great Place to Work! During my time at Blizzard I learned values that are instilled in my work philosophy and is invested in building up internal staff. It is a fantastic atmosphere and would recommend Blizzard to anyone. Great place to work My time there was fun, fulfilling and wonderful. The people were great, the environment was fun and energetic. Management tends to shift a lot in vision, going from having a lot of slack to micromanagement, but they have learned from the experience. Ok place to work The culture at Blizzard is awesome. Great place to work. However lately Management is at an all time low. Bet besides that people there are passionate about the company and their products Great Benefits Bad Management fun workplace fun workplace, would recommend. Compensation is low, advancement options are also low. good benefits, lighthearted environment, good company culture too. Blizzard can be stressful I worked for them for 2 years. I had a great manager in the night shift. He was nice, but the morning manager was not nice, and micro managing. I hate Pays ok Micro management, drugs are okay among the young people Excellent place to work Wonderful place to work, great people and culture. We pursued many interesting projects and had a lot of freedom to explore. Salaries are a bit below average but that is made up for by the people/environment. people that are on your team are great to work wth people that are on your team are great to work with, however the responsibilities to pay scale is way off. There are a few perks to working there such as free games, and game time for WoW. great co workers not enough pay for the work required Awesome Place to work! Blizzard is a very chilled place to work. I enjoyed working there. The Atmosphere is relaxing and there are a lot of amenities that are offered, such as a gym, massages, and even sword classes. Video game company Game Master Position Work tickets, take phone calls or engage in live chats. The game becomes part of your job as you strive to support a sometimes toxic and unforgiving player base and fulfill inane requests or defend policy. Free game time for Wold of Warcraft and lots of free video game stuff, but the pay was well below industry standard. This is not a job for people with an active family life or who are the soul income for a multi-person household. This is a great job for a single gamer who is passionate for Blizzard Entertainment products and has time to devote toward it. Free video games and access to Blizzard products and exclusive items. Free video games don't put food on the table. Fun place to work Great place to work and filled with many like minded people. Be wary though, Blizzard HR department is an absolute joke, filled with unprofessional and laughably slow individuals. Do not let them or the recruiting process shape your image of the company. Awesome place to work Amazing culture and very competitive. Management was a little too serious and performance was too strict, at least in customer service. A truly inspiring culture and workplace, with a focus on quality. Fun and Dedicated Company Culture and Rewards, with LOTS of WORK!!! This company is a dream come true to many. It is dedicated to it's employees, and provides ample moves within the company. Plenty of Upward movement for those able. There is a lot of internal competition....lots of Masters in their craft. The best skills you can have are ingenuity, problem solving, thinking outside the box, and Imagination. Ability to learn new skills and master at applying them. Depending on your department, may be easier or harder to move up, due to the volume and desire. Also, some of the other necessary qualities are, social skills, as you will need to be able to appease the higher ups and get on their good side. A lot of buddy buddy system in Management. Lots of Concerts, events, anniversary celebrations, record setting and record breaking. Gaming and Beta testing of Games. It's well worth it and the company experience itself provides you invaluable Title Credit Worthiness for other companies. Free Lunches, Discounts and Free Company Items, Health Insurance, Friendly and Fun environment. Work can become burdensome with OVETIME, 60-80hrs, Some positions are poorly paid compared to upper tiers / cost of living Job of your dreams Amazing culture, it will easily be the best job you have ever done. The only snag is getting in and keeping your position. Cuts are made from the temporary staff suddenly and without notice. Amazing People, Great Work Environment, Amazing Benifets, Break Room Hard to get in Fantastic company that makes great games. Without a doubt one of the most fun places I could imagine working. They do their best to take care of each and every employee and truly love games. Their products are second to none and I was proud to work on the games I did. The hours can be a lot when a game is about to launch, but to be fair, this was several years ago and this practice might have changed. New Company New company. Needs to work out the initial new company kinks. Once that has been established will be a good company to work . Pay is lower than other oil field positions. Good to start out at. Great place to work I would go back to Blizzard in the future for other opportunities. Great campus and people. Everyone is passionate about what they do and it's great to have been part of the Blizzard family. I will be back. Nerd culture galore with a professional and innovative atmosphere. Working at Blizzard Entertainment was a true grasp of great company atmosphere. A typical day involved daily meetings and/or emails of the tasks for that day, with a vast amount of freedom to go about the aforementioned task in any way. Whenever I was faced with a problem the upper management swiftly answered and helped me get past it. The culture is overflowing through every corridor, with many customizing their cubicles to better fit their ""nerdom"". From a glance you could see others interest outside of the company which made relations between co-workers easier. Their is also a multitude of events happening to get you more involved with everyone else. Their was nothing truly challenging about the job, except perhaps having to leave. The most enjoyment I found about the job was getting hyped with the atmosphere and in awe of what these brilliant minds create. All in all, Blizzard Entertainment is by far one of the best places to work with many benefits and even free swag. I was honored to be apart of the company for as long as I was. Free Swag, Friendly Coworkers, Gourmet campus lunches, near-weekly events. Honestly I cannot think of much... Absolutely the best environment and co-workers To start, there was nothing wrong with the job. It is customer support. You answer phone calls, you answer tickets, you help solve customer's problems. Management is great, job growth opportunities are outstanding. I have almost nothing bad to say about working at Blizzard. I do want to focus on the work environment though. It is the friendliest place I have ever worked, and possibly will ever work at. You get to dress casually, you get to talk to fellow reps who are working right beside you about anything. Movies, games, hobbies, anything. As long as you still focus on your work and do a good job of course. You can decorate your desks with whatever you want, you can have a very friendly and down to earth relationship with all of your co-workers, even the ones in higher positions. The one bad thing is that it is very difficult to actually use your sick time, as you have to meet a strict criteria of what counts as 'being sick'. Due to it being essentially a call center, you are susceptible to getting sick. But you have to use your paid time off for it, as the sick time will almost never be used.

Shure| Good place to work People are very passionate about the products and take great pride in them. Overall company cares for their people. The facilities are great. However, they are very slow to change. Most of the team works well together and help each other out. The company is good and improving on the benefits side, they could be a little more competitive on the pay side of things. Advancement seems stagnant and some co-workers check out for most of the day and have you cover their work. Solid Company with potential growth A lot of people are passionate with the company's brand and products. The best of the company is yet to come.. There is a lot of opportunity as the company is investing with the strategic plan.

Innovative Innovative and fast-growing company. High quality products. Excellent company culture. If you are a musician the culture will suit you very well. The pace is quick, but it is exciting. Absolutely loved working here This place is awesome. People stay here and there is seldom an opportunity for hire. The company is small but grows at a slow pace. The people are very smart, friendly and helpful. Would love to return. The workload is cyclical. When there is a great need they use contractors. Great place to work for. Contractors are used instead of hiring Amazing Great people and a place to work. The job environment is fantastic and everyone does their part. If it wasn't a contract only position I would've stayed. Awesome Place to work The environment at Shure encourages its employees to give their best effort. They treated their interns with respect and made sure to show appreciation for our work, regardless of how trivial some assignments may have been. At the end of the summer, the interns were asked to give presentations which summarized our experience at the company. These presentations were all back to back for an entire day, and were organized by department. I was impressed with and grateful for the excellent attendance of full-time associates of all levels who were eager to see what the interns had done for their respective departments. Loved it, and will be forever thankful for that experience. Family Oriented Compassionate staff Mostly in preventative maintenance on hvac,plumbing, electrical, lathes, mold injection machines.

The products are marketed through music instrument dealers and sound contractors. Good place to work People are very passionate about the products and take great pride in them. Overall company cares for their people. The facilities are great. However, they are very slow to change. Rotated contractors through quickly Contractors only kept for the minimum amount of time for each project. Training was limited to exact area of need. The larger system level viewpoint was not presented. Testing was outsourced to India. Challenging Management left contractors in the dark Shure's Internship Program is very well run. The internship program helps introduce the interns to the company and all its different functions and allows them to learn and grow while gaining valuable experience in their field. 2 OK place to work Every company I ever worked at were good places to work. The work was almost always interesting. The work environment was always friendly and helpful, everyone worked together, there was never any animosity or backstabbing, the people are the BEST! Productive Environment It's great to work with at a place where everyone knows what they're doing. There are a lot of engineers who work for Shure, which creates a nice environment and adds to the culture. Breaks Very good people but management is unfair The products on that company is super and the finance is very stable. The people there are probably the best to work with. The only issue I can see with that company is the upper management. The unfairness is the common theme through out the company. If you are the hand pick one, you can do no wrong and will be set for life there. If you are not, there is no advance opportunity for you there. Good stable job unfairness happy work with shure shure company is very good to work with and fun and co work is very nice to work with.shure alway tell employee alway costomer come first and happy and fun Toxic working environment When left my previous job to join Shure, to be convinced I was promised many things that in short term I could see that were just false promises, between them the respect and life quality that didn't exist. Instead of this, there were a lot of bad things, that I don't want even recall to say here - this is just the tip of the iceberg, and such things didn't happen only to me. The saddest thing is HR knowing about this kind of behaviour and just closing their eyes and letting things happen, only because sales targets are being achieved. The company has great products and great professionals, but unfortunately the company needs to re-evaluate its concepts and pay more attention to the human resources, avoiding them to suffer harsh behaviour from certain managers. Disrespect, working WAY more than was set, public humilliations, etc A nice environment to work It is a nice environment to work. The engineers and the developers are friendly, easy to work with, and ready to provide professional help. Free donuts. Sometimes free lunch. Reasonable break time. Productive place to work. Great learning experiance. It was a great place to work, They just decided to move production out of the country therefore eliminating quite a few jobs. Great place to work It was great place to be. The people were very fun. Positive area to be around if you love music. The products they sell are the best in the industry. Challanging atmosphere None Fun workplace Excellent internship experience for 3 months time. The best workplace culture I have ever experienced. Excellent team members to work with as well. I felt truly blessed to have worked at Shure for 36 years plus. The corporate culture of continuous improvement was well supported and nurtured. Typical day at work: review MRP messages immediately; spend 1/2 of my AM on the production floor; prepare for production meetings PM; review capacity reports for work centers I planned and scheduled; finish day on the production floor. What I learned: ownership; proactive mentality; continuous improvement mindset; corporate core values that one can use in his personal life. Management: supportive of work force; family friendly company. Hardest part of job: New Product Team leaders wanting to compromise corporate and plant policies. Most enjoyable part of job: Enjoying a strong relationship with production staff. Fairly predicatable work day expectations; supportive management. Outsourcing direct labor jobs and jobs that support direct labor to Mexico and China, refusing to recognize the marketing value of MADE IN AMERICA! was a good place to work for awhile I worked at the wheeling facility for 8 months as a temp. I enjoyed working the first shift with overtime. The company phased out the production area and turned it into a finished goods area. Management decided to let the production people with severance packages. Instead of hiring the temps permanently they rehired their production staff and let go the temps who were already trained in the finished goods area. management didnt care about the temps a lot Good place to work Shure is a good place to work that makes industry leading products. Decision making at Shure is generally done through consensus that can both be good and bad. Shure offers a good work/life balance. Good atmosphere fun place to work It was a fun place to work, with a heavy influence on music. They lacked in compensation though. I also wish there was better direction or room for growth. SHURE - An Inspiring Work Atmosphere I found it inspirational to work at Shure, in light of the Company's many achievements & world-wide respect. It was a very clean environment to work in. My typical day was filled with Customs related Job Tasks. I found Shure Management to be spirited, friendly & open-minded to new ideas. My co-workers were helpful. The hardest part of the Job was any Projects that needed to be completed in a concise & short time frame, due to Staffing Shortages. The most enjoyable part of the job was the Projects I completed, plus exposure I gained to new aspects of International Business, such as The C-TPAT Program. Job Kept Me Quite Busy Contract Job Only Fun work environment with a lot of creative people I will refrain from specific reviews out of professional courtesy and my position within the company. Creative work environment Good place to work for A very good environment to work for with well management. The benefit is unbelievable. The work hour is flexible to employee schedule. Team lunch ocasional assigned too many teams at once Muy buena Empresa y muy recomendable. Los anos en que yo trabaje para la Empresa Shure Incorporated fueron los mejores anos, dure 27 anos porque el ambiente de trabajo era muy bueno, tanto laboral como con mis companeros, aprendi mucho durante tantos anos, al principio fue un poco dificil porque no sabia nada, pero poco a poco fui aprendiendo . Fue una lastima que cerraran la Empresa porque el trabajo se lo trajeron a Cd. Juarez, Chih.Teniamos todas las prestaciones de Ley (Aseguranza, Vacaciones, Dias Festivos, Fondo de Ahorro, descandos 2 al dia. Fits people who love changes Shure paid the employees very well. The management was interested in changes. The means used in my prior department included constently changing employees' tasks, constantly changing the work processes, constantly changing application softwares, constantly changing working culture. Only one thing was constant there- change. If you love constant changes, then you belong there. 401k air conditioning system Good place to work People are very passionate about the products and take great pride in them. Overall company cares for their people. The facilities are great. However, they are very slow to change. Valuable and respectable team work environment At a team work environment, every one need contribute their best and work hard for the company. Their motivation and enthusiasm need be valued and respected by the management. any difficult can be overcome at this work place. flexible work time Work at home 3 7 A fast paced company that allows you to work independently and with a great core of colleagues. The education I received working for Shure Inc. for 8 years had been exceptional. My position varied, from working with the Marketing Dept, Engineering, Graphic Designers, The Logistic Dept, Accounting, along with the purchasing departments Sourcing Specialist and Commodity Managers. Using the SAP system I placed P.O.'s and maintained all information requested by management per our job. I worked daily with suppliers and our 3 manufacturing plants to make sure all material would be on time and to keep inventory levels down. I worked with the Commodity Management team to maintain cost quarterly. We all worked as a team which allowed us to provided information to upper management that would benefit the company. Working with teams on projects was the most enjoyable part of the job. Friendly and Productive Easy to learn and work Friendly and helpful people Approachable management Best company I ever worked for! Employee friendly. Professional and helpful atmosphere. Some of the best technical talent I've ever had the pleasure to work with. Family Feel Organization A fun organization to work for that does have a family like feel. Run as fast as you can' Stay away from this place and RUN! This is a terrible place to work! In my department, people smiled in your face and then stabbed you in the back! Management showed alot of favoritism and were only looking out for their own welfare and keeping their own jobs. Sorry I ever worked at this company and glad to be gone! Nice building Too much work. Rude coworkers. Poor management Very solid and mature company to work for. Shure has been in business for a long time so its processes are well-defined and standardized. This mean the training for new employees was very helpful and easy to pick up. Learned a lot of new processes. Most manufacturing were moved out of country. Global exposure with a very complex supply chain. Private company, long-standing (founded in 1925), in transition. Interesting market orientation: sound delivery. A very good place to work A very good place to work I learned a great deal about acoustics good pay Great people, great company Shure is a great company to work at. They are located in a brand-new beautiful building, the people are friendly and laid-back, they make awesome products and they take care of their people. It's like having a second family. I heard rumblings about pay being slightly lower than other companies, but for audio enthusiasts (70% of the people who work there are musicians) it seems absolutely worth it to me. free music events, great products, casual environment, relaxed atmosphere premier audio company in the world Management is not forthright in anyting they do to steer the company. This permeates the company all the way to the executive VP. Extremely restrictive atmosphere as far as maneuverability within the organization. the control is enjoyed by only a handful of people. Many people in managerial positions have no idea what their job is great product line management is not forthright with it's associates Production zone allways clean,secure and nice. Experienced coworker help each other with their knowledge, help manage troubles every day following rules, and training coworkers, newones or from other deparments. The hardest part of the job was finishing on time, and the most enjoyable part of the job was finish with quality goods. anniversary party, heath insurance. Best Company In the World They care about the employee FIRST! They are very flexible, have the option to work at home. Got the opportunity to travel to different tradeshows. Great benefits!!! Great atmosphere. great discounts Good place to work People are very passionate about the products and take great pride in them. Overall company cares for their people. The facilities are great. However, they are very slow to change. Most of the team works well together and help each other out. The company is good and improving on the benefits side, they could be a little more competitive on the pay side of things. Advancement seems stagnant and some co-workers check out for most of the day and have you cover their work. Solid Company with potential growth A lot of people are passionate with the company's brand and products. The best of the company is yet to come.. There is a lot of opportunity as the company is investing with the strategic plan.

Casual dress, game room, multiple kegs Bottlenecks with advancement, too many software engineers 2 OK Place to Work Mostly nice people who care about your success, but easy to get burned out on trading, especially in a market with no trade. 2
Home Depot / THD|" ok place to work good co-workers but the schedule is all over the place different hrs each time and days pay is too low I use a forklift, reach lift, and order picker daily 5 1 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Great people What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Some associates don't do their work load What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Accepting people and low stress What is a typical day like for you at the company? Very Busy, helping customers and packing down items Easy Very easy job to do , pay was okay , the environment is always good there , it’s just one job to show up and get the day by.. and the breaks are always good Awesome job Loved this job. Didn’t love the pay so I had to move on. Benefits are awesome but the hourly pay is too low. Otherwise the Home Depot is a good place to work. It was a very fun work environment. Laid back and relaxed. Mid Tier Retail Job There's much better jobs that pay more for you to do something more fun with less strict and more fun managers and coworkers. Most people that worked here were pretty miserable and every task done was horribly boring. The pay was the only thing about this job that kept me there for as long as I was. Productive and fun workplace I love working at the pro desk. Some days can be stressful and some customers can also be rude as any other job. My experience at this job was great and has many benefits. Fun work environment Great for part time work. You get to meet a lot of people; coworkers and shoppers. You learn alot about home improvement and gardening. It can be hard to work during the summer if you have to be outside. Met Very labor intensive. Understaffed most of the time. But can be very fulfilling with what's being done. Store side appreciates what the MET team does. Lunches offered monthly. extra days off for holidays at times understaffed Corporate America Typical….hire as few people as possible and jam them with work, complain when work not done. Good benefits with bonuses twice a year. Buyer Beware! A good first job MET was my first job, and it was pretty straightforward. You basically went through the isles and made sure everything was good and did the seasonal set-ups. It got boring, but it was easy. Management wasn't bad, and we got free food, so that was nice. The culture of Home Depot as a whole, though, can feel like high school. All and all I enjoyed my team. We were like a family! Hard work decent pay I would consider this a temporary job if your just looking for decent pay but it's really hard work mostly unorganized and your based off of performance even when there is an obvious lack of work on the companies end so you'll still be evaluated on not meeting Performance when your working hard doing several jobs to try and meet this unrealistic expectation. Great staff team. Management listens to your concerns, This is a great part-time job for students, the flexible schedules help accommodate the working mothers and their kids school schedule, the staff and customers are super, and last but not least the Success Sharing. Great place to work The management cares about who you are and what you do for the company. Work with great people. It’s just a hard time to become a full time employee. Productive Managers and supervisors are helpful and nice! They are good at training if needed, but also alot of computer training. The garden was very busy in the summer but fun. Terrible. Though THD is a great learning environment for retail, product or fitness, fellow workers all experience the same issues. Management, underpaid, irregular schedule, and understaffing. THD in Salem is stressful. They are understaffed, so it would make sense for it to be stressful, but management and overworking puts the icing on the cake. No one wants to work because they schedule too much or too little. No one wants to work because management drops their problems on associates and expects them to do more than what they are paid for. Management will criticize you, follow you, borderline stalk you to complain about you, but won't do their own job. They also enjoy threatening associates if something does not go right in their department. In the end, find another THD. 30-60 minute lunch Management, Understaffing, Underpaid, Over Worked, Irregular Schedule Fun workplace Very enjoyable job, I worked there for almost a year and enjoyed my time there. The company is very helpful to its associates and my managers were very understand and compassionate as I was a single mother when I started working there Productive and fun I didn’t expect Home Depot to be this cool. But they care about your time and work hard to fit the schedule. I would recommend working here. Pay is competitive. Retail employee Managers weren’t understanding, wanted to write you up for anything. Tried to move up but was stalled each time i asked to get trained on forklift. Ultimately left because was too stressed out about job. Managers are terrible Managers are awful and only care about what customers need rather than their workers. Managers will do anything a customer wants and workers are treated bad by everyone else. A decent experience overall (so far, anyway) I’ve been working at Home Depot for a few months now. I’d say that it’s a generally decent place to work at. My coworkers are friendly and helpful, the majority of us actually do our jobs, and the customers are generally fine. In this review, I’ll mainly be mentioning my little gripes about working at my specific store, by the way. I do wish that we’d get a little more support at front end because the head cashiers are sometimes nowhere to be found when you need them (either in the back or across the store doing whatever). No one checks up on us, and the managers seem to not care. The head cashiers also expect you to be able to hold your own by yourself at self checkout/the registers, even though you’re super new. They give us newbies a little bit of training, then we just dive straight into being behind the register/self checkout with no help unless you holler at them/other cashiers for it. It’s not that hard, but it can get busy, there’s many things to remember, and at least half of the customers are super needy. And half the time, the different departments’ phones are busy or they ignore our calls. They sometimes ignore or don’t hear overhead calls, too. Oh, and they (the store itself) really want you shove Home Depot credit cards down customers’ throats. I can’t sell them to save my life because most customers don’t want more credit cards, or they already have a Home Depot credit card. As for management, I pretty much only see them when they walk past us at front end to go to or from the back or other aisles by front end. One of them (if you’re unlucky enough to be spotted Ok work place Home Depot was a good place to work. The people were friendly. I like helping the customers and the managers were friendly. The store was clean and I have no complaints ok place to work good co-workers but the schedule is all over the place different hrs each time and days pay is too low I use a forklift, reach lift, and order picker daily 5 1 Fun but they have favorites You’ll meet great people but managements have favorites. Pay is ok but u get a bonus at the end of the year. They are pretty strict with coming in late or calling off and it’s difficult to get the days u want off 1 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? The friendly customers and staff What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Under paid and understaffed What is the work environment and culture like at the company? You look out for your self. You are thrown on the floor with very little training What is a typical day like for you at the company? Picking up trash from night crew. Assisting customers and trying to explain why we don’t have what they want in stock for It's not bad but could be a lot better. It is a pleasant place to work. But they are always short on staff which can create stress at work. Also there is a lot of favoritism. Some part time employees get offered full time positions immediately (secretly) while others only get a few hours per week who have been there for months. Nice co-workers. Some of the managers are really good. Schedualing, sometimes you don't get two days off together. And you may have to work 6 or 7 days in a row. Fun and learning environment Learned a lot about the company, both Operations and Retail side. Dealt with customer service and special services request from clients. Fun place to work, management gives back to their employees and are always doing events for the associates. Company Success sharing Bonus Sometimes understaffed Not bad Easy job, good pay. Answering phones, returning items, and placing customer orders was all I did. Aside from customers being rude sometimes that’s at every job. A good place to work for job security. Working for the home depot is overall a good place to work. Depending on what department you're working in you have to be somewhat physically fit in order to be on your feet all day. Also be willing to work weekends on a 8 hour shift. The benefits are amazing and the pay is decent. You can easily move up in the company if you are willing to learn more about the business. Pretty cool workplace I’ve worked at two Home Depot locations. Both have been pretty good, the only downside is the scheduling isn’t that flexible. Your schedule is put out dang near 3 weeks ahead and it’s hard to get shifts covered. Poco amigable no llevan protocolo Una empresa que no te ayuda en nada,y tampoco te apoya Most people seemed happy. Had a good fair nice Manager. Supervisor was OK. Pay every two 2 weeks ,3 blocks from bus line. Young population, very clean . Nice place, clean ... Fun workplace. Low pay I really enjoy working at Home Depot as a front end cashier but the pay was too low so I had to move on and find a better paying job. I really like my co-workers but management was a different story 3 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Working with flowers. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? New manages with little experience looking for power. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Employees were considered less important than customers. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Meet with a wide variety of people providing information about different types of plants. 4 stars What is the best part of working at the company? They are understanding when it’s an emergency and you need to leave and it’s like a family not a business. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Having to do multiple jobs because of people not wanting to come to work What is the work environment and culture like at the company? The environment is friendly for the most part and busy What is a typical day like for you at the company? Very busy with the lines going out the door If you are not the managers favorite,there is no going up for you This place is like highschool. Management does not care if you have too many tasks on you. They only want results. If you are not the managers favorite, there is no room for moving up wards for you. Flexiblity Cliche groups overall a company is a company. overall it wasn't a bad job for the 7+ years. you do have space to grow, you just need to know the right people. Pay was ok could be better for being there for so long and all the work they pile on you. great team low pay Ok Management seemed to cater to full-time employees, and somewhat disregarded part-time staff. Overall a decent place to work with reasonable pay and expectations. Other employees are courteous and helpful I like working with the public and asking about their projects. Customers are grateful for the extra time spent with them. It is always nice to engage customers about their projects Overnights I enjoyed working there management worked with you if you had a second job. They also were helpful when you had problems or issues with other co workers and or problems, Good atmosphere Somedays not enough people for the amount of freight Good people bad management Management like to pick favorites. The friends of the managers get the bonuses and ability to practically be untouchable to most or some of the company rules. The other workers on the other hand are some of the friendliest people I have met. Ok place to work if you get along with your managers. Because one manager didn’t like me, they all didn’t because during the weekly manager meetings he would talk about me & my work ethic. No motivation to do well if your managers are always trying to find something wrong in your work. Enjoy job when not pushing credit cards on people - Worked with me to accommodate bad shoulder, waiting on surgery. Do not approve of the ""pushing"" of getting new credit card accounts. Good atmosphere overall. Most enjoyable part of job is learning new things, helping people solve problems. ok place to work good co-workers but the schedule is all over the place different hrs each time and days pay is too low I use a forklift, reach lift, and order picker daily 5 1 Good workers beware If you want a job where you can spend your whole shift just standing around doing the bare minimum, this is the job for you. If you want to work with a management team that works with you and not against you, don't try here. Nothing is worse than working for a company that makes you take monthly quizzes and preach SOP, but conveniently forget all those SOP when asked why others aren't held to the same standard they are holding you to. If you go to management about harassment.. expect to be given the run around about taking action, expect to be lied to, and then expect to be fired. The good: The company itself isn't bad. You get a bonus twice a year depending on your store's sales. There is the ability to move up. Work and life balance is like any other 8/40hr workweek. If you are working overnight then the 2 days for 1 day worked might get confusing and needing adjusting to. Everyone's experience is different. This one was mine. 1 Nice place to work Good company, good management support. Do what's expected of you and all is well. Work environment is busy and hectic most of the times. Fellow employees are nice and helpful. You have the opportunity to take thirty minutes or an hour lunch break. Dress code is too diverse. 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? The respect for each other. And food, lots of food! What is the most stressful part about working at the company? When it's understaffed but still the management still try their best to help the staff on a daily basis. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Like a family. 100%. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Busy. Especially morning shift. Enjoyable work environment It was a good place to work at, management alway available to help if needed, and good coworkers. Compensation its not so good whatsoever, recommended for students as a pastime job. work environment pay Pretty good for an introvert I love working from home and not dealing with customers in person. It’s an easy job and really slow at night . The cx can get really irate but we have a department that deals with that . Training was good but you really learn the important stuff on the job . Decent benefits too. I just wish it paid more . Don't recommend The management sucks. They don't tend to understand. You have to remind them that you won't be able to come on a certain day and they still forget. They don't care about you. They overwork you and sometimes make you stay longer hours. Free lunches Makes your day stressful 3 out of 5 If you work hard and do your job (not common these days) you have nothing to fear. Home Depot gives good benefits that you would expect from a large corporation. As an OFA I ran laps around others doing WAY less work for the company knowing I got paid the same, which was a bit demoralizing. Good Benefits and willing to work with your schedule (most of the time) Pay could be higher for how much the company makes Bleeding Orange The company itself has a great message and really wants to advocate for the employees more than anything else. Unfortunately, some people get caught in a store that has lost that message along the way. Retail is a different type of beast but THD can really support you and take you places if you let it. Benefits, bonuses, stocks Expensive Health Care Management lacking Not like it used to be. Not really any teamwork anymore. Management doesn't manage like they should and a lot of things happen here that should not. Work didn't have to be fun. But employees shouldn't dress clocking in. Na Good place to work Good people good No room for growth Busy Lots of training Good location Safe place to work Feeling of accomplishment Staying on task The customers make it fun. I love working at home depot the only downfall is they hired a bunch of new people and cut all the hours of us who worked there a while. I love how well we all work together. Puppies Bad hours Great place Great place to work they have games to play on break like basketball and arcade games which I thought was really cool and they also have employee meals they provide great training the only way you will not succeed working at Home Depot is if you don’t put in the work on your part.I learned the importance of coming back from breaks on time while working here. They are understanding of family issues arise in life at home. Está bien para empezar un nuevo trabajo Tiene un horario temprano pero no hay equidad al momento de asignar tareas Hard Working job , Concentration on customers needs Most of the time Customers needs help on locations of items , we direct them very nicely , sometimes if we get a chance go with the customer to show them the direction of the Particular Dept . Ask them to open an account with home depot credit card & tell them the benefits of opening an account . 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? The people you work with They have become friends What is the most stressful part about working at the company? It gets very busy. Often you are working with minimal staffing What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Environment is good. Culture is like most big companies They expect you to work and to do your job What is a typical day like for you at the company? packing out product, customer service, answering questions 4 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Close to home, part-time schedule. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Belligerent and condescending customers. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? High school. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Ranges from fast paced to boring. 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? The benefits! What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Cleaning up after other associates! What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Good people and strange supervisors What is a typical day like for you at the company? Costumer service and unload and load trucks,, stocking heavy products Generally overworked and underpaid, but has variety/autonomy High turnover, lack of training, and lack of spare time make this job a headache of responsibilities concentrated on the few experienced and competent workers - so much to be done, and a decent amount of willing workers, but so many areas that receive no formal training and never the spare resources to train newer associates on these, so they are left to a few people or simply not done at all. However, in my case at least, I was granted near-full autonomy in how I chose to spend my time, since there was always so much to do. Picking lumber orders, gathering returns at the SD, key-receiving customer orders, making phone calls, re-arranging staging locations, going through reports in the training room - for tasks of equal urgency, I could pick and choose what I wanted to do, which was quite nice. Compared to the absolute monotony of cashiering, I would still choose this position. Final level of compensation was 21.50 / hour, but with biannual bonus figured in, it was maybe closer to 23. Typically worked 45 hours a week. Variety and opportunity to learn Stressful and frustrating, underpaid overview Depending on the store you work at will depend on your overall experience. I absolutely enjoyed my job cause the entire store was great and never had any issues. 4 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Great people to work with What is the most stressful part about working at the company? No stress during any shift. Good managers What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Really excellent culture. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Be on time. Help customers. Feel good ok place to work good co-workers but the schedule is all over the place different hrs each time and days pay is too low I use a forklift, reach lift, and order picker daily 5 1 Productive and fun Best company I've ever worked for. Great pay and benefits and lots of room for advancement. When it comes to the freight team specifically, you can't beat working at night. No customers, store to yourself, sweat for 8 hours and go home. Love it! Management was nice and the people were great to work with. The culture is really unique compared to most retail environment's. I loved my co-workers as they help get you through the day. Part timers could only get so many hours through out the week. Management was fair to me, but I can't really agree with some of the time policies they implement. Decent incentives for part-time workers. Pizza party's every now and then were nice Hours can be flaky Customer service number one priority Very organized and number one priority is the customer, which is great for the store but it also means constantly must be doing something. I like fast paced,busy environment so it was great for me but if you are not motivated it will not be a good fit. Management is lacking If you want a job where managers actually provide help and feedback this isn't the place. The only good thing about this job is that its fairly flexible with your schedule if you have another job or school commitments. Managers are either MIA when you need help, or are piling on work for you to do when you're under staffed. Stressful but simple job very overworked and understaffed… no one made you feel needed yet i was constantly asked to stay longer/pick up shifts due to understaffing. there were employee appreciation days etc but of course that’s all corporate It was a good environment but very hard to get a full time position The compensation was minimal compared to the amount of work expected. Management needs to recognize the people that shine and want to make this a career Fun workplace, but stressful a lot of the time The people were fun to work with. Management wasn't terrible but not the greatest. Hardest part about the job was meeting their impossible sales goals. Go elsewhere. Worst job ever. Incompetent and ignorant supervisors play favorites. Expected to work nonstop for poor salary, 50¢ raises and bonuses of less than $200. Team member gets away with threatening co-workers. Any normal employer would of fired the worker on the spot. This one received a reward! Training consists of being dumped in front of a desktop computer. No oppty for advancement or career path. If you like working in an environment where you're constantly monitored, hard work goes unrecognized and people who don't do anything are rewarded, then this is the job for you. Wonderful place to work Been with THD for 10 years. Massive room for growth and development. Consistent pay increases for associates and management. Strong, inclusive culture in Monroe. We work hard and play harder. Understaffed Too much work put on your shoulders while supervisors and tenured employees sit back and relax. Same people get recognition at monthly meetings while the true workers are pushed into the shadows 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? Their is nothing good working for Home depot. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Not a thing What is the work environment and culture like at the company? The work environment is poor and same for culture. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Very stressful. Productive and repetitive I unloaded trucks and stocked shelves overnight and it just got to be so repetitive and boring. We were a high volume store so there was a lot of freight to unload and stock most nights. Management didn’t really care for the employees. Every night we’d get told about how sales goals were crushed while having to beg for so much as a gift card for our work. Manager never around You can’t found a manager, they always in the office, they don’t want to come up to deal with the issues!!! Everyone is doing what ever day want, because they know that the manager they are not around Work was fun but hard. Underpaid Co workers we’re helpful and friendly, the work was hard always short staffed even during holidays. Not enough hours or pay. Website never right which causes arguments between customers and employees. Co workers Management I highly suggest working for Home Depot if you hate yourself. They will not care if you’re sick and dying they will clock you out before calling anyone. (True story) Depot I worked at is a great place to work as long as you roll over and let them over work, under pay you and degrade you no matter how long, hard and well you work for them. Do not go into Home Depot #6549 expecting managers to care about you or your well being. They expect you to bleed orange and die for the Home Depot. Mandatory breaks on 4+ hour shifts Get chewed out for taking your breaks. Fast paced Lots of responsibility comes along with the service desk. Being nice can cost you with certain customers. Overall a fun place to work and meet people. 4 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Flexibility schedules What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Finding out of stock product What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Great employee relation What is a typical day like for you at the company? Lots of walking , customer service is number one ! They talk about a ""career"" but it is a lie. If you are willing to betray your ethics, morals and are willing to suck up to management then go on. It is the classic ""good ol' boy network. Performance is not rewarded. You must be one of the ""in crowd."" Great Place to Learn Money was not great compared to same job title at other companies, but training is better than most, as long as you are open to it. I received a lot of in depth training that helped propel me into my career. Ughhh Pay and benefits are good. Management sucks and preaches about safety they don't care about. If you care about your safety, and care about your mental well being, run the other way. ok place to work good co-workers but the schedule is all over the place different hrs each time and days pay is too low I use a forklift, reach lift, and order picker daily 5 1 customer service Good company to work for. Management gets involved and associates are appreciated. Good benefits and flexibility. Safety is enforced and company is very focus on improving constantly. 1 Goods days but lots of angry customers Customers calling about problems with orders, stores calling for issues with customers orders and placing orders. Having to call vendors and delivery agents and be on hold for long times. Lots of angry customers who items are damaged or delayed. I couldn't take it after so many rude customers. fun place to work, though understaffed My time at the home depot I worked in lumber, was pretty fast paced through the day but chilled out towards closing. Only negative I can think of is contractors coming in and being rude to staff. contractors Productive and very demanding So far so good and i am enjoying working with home Depot. Career development is a priority. High level stakeholder. Work priority is key. Encouragement and guidance. Decent work place I would recommend working at the Home Depot as a first time job or someone looking to produce some part-time/ temporary income. I would consider it as more of a stepping stone. There isn’t much room for advancement due to signs favoritism at my specific location. 2 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Pay was on time What is the most stressful part about working at the company? The store I worked at tolerated workplace harassment. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Toxic. Older female associates were treated by male department supervisors What is a typical day like for you at the company? I reported to work on time but never knew when I’d be able to leave. Managers always play favorites for promotions If you have any interest in moving up, you better kiss up to your asms, or you'll just be left in the same spot you're in until you leave that dump. No raises, or recognition. pay is decent Very cliquey. Managers like who they like and promote their ""friends"" Workers are often treated as children, especially in monthly meetings. Pay is competitive for the area. Overall not bad Management is pretty good at communication, makes it seem like the job is meaningful. Aside from customers not being the best at times, the job is not at all that bad Great company Great company that offers great benefits and tries to create an environment that is easy to be in. I would recommend working for The Home Depot. They are a great company. Decent work I worked as a freight associate. I was on the unload crew which meant that I unloaded trucks. Then we would all put the freight away on the shelves or the overhead storage. It was very physical work. The pay did not reflect the amount of effort needed to perform the job. Started at 12 an hour and eventually, through the company raising it's minimum slowly overtime, ended at 15 an hour. Better, but not a lot. Frequent breaks, Good management Pay, Corporate I felt appreciated by my peers and by my managers. Culture is solid. I’m blessed to have worked for THD and able to retire from there. They talk about culture, then follow it up with actions. They care about their customers, associates, and your families. They stressed a home/work balance. I loved my time there. Compensation, schedule, people, growth opportunities. None It's alright If you're looking for a pretty okay place to work this is it. Nothing special, very average underpaid career. Management can be hit or miss. Over all, okay. Great coworkers, friendly. Extremely anti-union. Spreads misinformation 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? The core values are upheld and growth is promoted What is the most stressful part about working at the company? The ever changing processes and procedures What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Even virtual you have a sense of belonging and connection. We take care of each other. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Log in assist customers and chat with peers all day! I would tell people not to work there Used to be a good company to work for but now they could careless about the employees. It's all about money, less workers & more work. Longer u r there the more they take advantage of you. 4 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Knowing I am doing something for people ,who need it. Ang my quality speaks for itself What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Dealing with alot of attitudes What is the work environment and culture like at the company? It's calm at time,but you can tell ,who take pride in there job. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Just doing my job . Not much else to say Productive and fun workplace Good job for a high school student. Hours are flexible and work is easy. Customers and management are very friendly and will help you with whatever you need Working alone and hours I like working without someone over my should. It gave me opportunity to make job my own. However, I could not get use to working overnight and sleeping during the day. I believe it was because of spring of year and more light hours than dark Fast paced, room for advancement Monday through Thursday 10 hour shifts mornings Weekend 12 hour shifts or nights 10 hour shifts available. Pick down aisles with electric pallet jack. Hard to make numbers when given small work assignments. Good pay, lunches provided occasionally, Will start you seasonal and if you make the cut they hire you on. No store discount but if company does well in sales bonus are given. Management wants numbers they expect you to pick 1 minute per transaction meaning once at location should only take you one minute. Human Resources team are helpful and Happy assist. Overall good company if you stick out long term, be ready to work fast, get out on time and make friends. Nice people and laid back atmosphere I actually really loved working here but couldn't even get 30 hours. Average 20 a week. There was a lot of other employees also asking for more hours. At least the max for part time. But nope. And they steadily hiring new people everyday. They would advertise to get new people. I couldn't pay my rent with 20-25 hrs a week..and I got kids I can't work 2 jobs. So I quit and got a full time job and better pay at Amazon.."
State Street|" Great Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire. 3 It's very stressful and the pay is below average As an associate who had been working there for 5 years through 3 different roles, I can tell it's a stressful place to work. Maybe a nice place for new graduates but please move on after one or two years. Great workplace Great workplace. Accomadated work from home, great benefits, great coworkers. If you have the opportunity to work for this company, definitely take it. Great People Work life balance is great. Very understanding managers. The benefits are excellent. The technology is still improving but they are going in the right direction. team working environment What stands out about working at State Street was it's team work mentality. Everyone that I worked with were willing to team in a good team atmosphere 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? Really didn’t enjoy the culture What is the most stressful part about working at the company? They don’t train you well, What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Very old school & doesn’t pay enough What is a typical day like for you at the company? Stressful could be better It's about who you know here. It can be difficult to get promotions if you do not know the right people. Certain managers are easier to deal with than others. A lot of office politics to work through depending on the department. Is known for its toxic environment Good: Decent for entry level, building your network Bad: however workload is unreasonable at all levels. Management not supportive. Company became very siloed and employees were pitted against each other instead of cross collaboration and knowledge sharing. Irresponsible and Mismanaged Talented applicants and candidates should stay away from State Street. Don’t waste your energy and talent for a company that is being managed by old timers/boomers. They will not recognize your work and are clueless on the long term vision of the company. Any skills and experiences that you picked up elsewhere will be diminished. If you’re desperate to accept a role here; don’t use your personal time to work extra hours in the hopes that you‘ll be appreciated. Senior management are constantly finding opportunities to lay off resources (us) for short term benefits (their sweet bonuses) without considering the long term impact to the company. Also, management are pushing employees to go back to the office. They basically disregarded the majority of workforce that do not support it based on a recent survey result. If a State Street recruiter market the job as remote or hybrid, make sure to get it in writing before accepting the job. Busy, but manageable. Your experience is largely dependent on what team you’re on; but overall a positive experience. Pay could be better, and layoffs can be a problem. There’s also a disconnect between senior management and everyone else. Great learning opportunities but stressful Very stressful to work here and the culture is not conducive to being happy long term. People stay a long time because they find something that they are comfortable with and it pays fairly well (but pretty flat in terms of growth). Layoffs, forced curve ranking of employees State Street continues to force managers to apply forced curve ranking of employees which is clearly aimed at setting up layoffs. Managers are forced to rank individuals as below expectations even if not an accurate reflection of performance. This practice has caused attrition well beyond the point of causing operational problems yet it continues, probably because upper management always is looking to pull the trigger on additional layoffs whenever their quarterly earnings don’t look good. On the plus side, there are many great people at State Street who do everything they can to treat their people well. Upper management however is doing major damage with this fake and outdated forced curve ranking requirement Good managers, friends and work wise its very nice however we wont get what we work here Good managers, friends and work wise its very nice however we won't get what we work here apart from that everything is fine Productive, Educational, and Compensation This corporation is run extremely well and rewards employees who want to “work”! Your extra efforts are recognized and appreciate by management. The management team enables you to excel through training and educational opportunities. Great place to start a career Great, laid-back culture. Hard work is rewarded and the managers I had really cared about developing and supporting their reports. Overall, this is a great place to work, especially for entry-level employees. You will learn, meet a bunch of great people and be given as much flexibility as you need. The only con is the compensation is very low for most positions. Not great Very strange and semi-hostile culture. A great company to get your start in banking but make sure to look for other opportunities elsewhere so you have options. It's ok Good benefits. Advancement opportunities if you apply yourself. The work is pretty dull across most departments. Also can be long hours depending on the business unit. It's a fine place to start a career. Eventually you'll feel chained to a cubicle It’s okay If you don’t have money and you work paycheck to paycheck to pay the bills you get treated differently and looked down on. Most of the staff was snobby. Nice people but outdate pay grades Overall, difficult to get ahead. Outdate pay levels and still stuck in old ways. Technologically they are behind and the workload is a lot for 1 day. people are nice health and dental benefits; pay rate stability Great place to start a career and learn how to work for a living and gain skills that you utilize throughout career. Excellent opportunity for different career tracks and great training and resources for professional development. Terrible training watching people do the job and then being sent on your way Is not ""training"". Calling out your mistakes in front of the whole staff, while still new is not ""training"" Consistent hours Poor training Great Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire. 3 Good Pay and Benefits Depends on the office what the turnover rate is due to elections. Not a lot of advancement opportunities. Work/Home life is hard to balance during sessions. Great Learning Experience Good benefits and great first job. Plenty of room to grow. State Street offers a wide variety of careers. Set goals and a motivated person should have many opportunities. See below 1.0 Management is willing to lose the talent at hand but won`t retain/promote it. 2.0 Staffing issues due to 1.0 will lead to some folks working more than others. 3.0 Lack of reasonable pay structure and bonuses. 4.0 The only benefit is to get their name on your resume. Have to fight for raise The work atmosphere was challenging Management was biased toward minorities I had to fight with my manager anytime I had my review My department was finally outsource to India Flexibility hostile work atmosphere Productive pay does not reflect the amount of work done you work as an associate but get paid as an intern. Good Team Great Learning Less Politics Believes in Growing Together Could be better Benefits, and PTO were good. The pay was under industry average. The culture would vary depending on the team you fall under. It was a good stepping stone. Good people, fairly flexible, hybrid environment Low pay, can be difficult to move up depending on the department you're in. Ok Ok for what it is but not really fulfilling unless you love sending navs out nightly. Could probably pay more but really for what the work actually is (pressing buttons in a macro) why would they? typical sad cubicle job Building looks like prison. workers are there only for paycheck. typical 9-5 cubicle job. Not for me. although I really enjoyed working with my kind manager. But the job and job setting and culture is not one I would want to spend my life working in. Interesting work and environment A good group of people to work with. Projects are interesting and beneficial to increasing your skillset. Management is always willing to provide access to new opportunities. Education and expansion of your skills is always welcome. State Street Use to be an Amazing Company, but has moved backwards in last 20 years Move more and more jobs overseas, lower pay, benefits have dropped. Most people are great to work with, but more and more people do not stay long. Company no longer takes care of all its employees. Emphasis on Lower Cost Locations in India, Poland, etc... Ability to work from home as needed for many years Lower Pay, Benefits have decreased Good place to learn It's a good place to start your career . And it wholly depends on the team you are alotted to. Some managers let you work a lot with high pressure . And some don't . So it depends mainly on luck which department you are put in . Try to get into hedge funds and private equity financial reporting Many excellent colleagues, major projects and initiatives under resourced System of policies, outside compliance and legal framework is extremely complicated by nature. It can be very arduous to try to simplify/change processes. Remote and Hybrid work model Health plan is high deductible, pace of progress is very slow at times. outsourcing has ruined company culture have work for the company for over 15 years. have worked with a lot of great people during my time. senior management doesn't provide any kind of support. pay is ok if you have been there for a long time or come from the outside. outsourcing has made everyone's job more difficult. The IT dept is the worst its over been in my career. Overall I would not recommend working here They don't care about people. Their goal is to overwork you at the lowest pay Many people left due to it's a toxic culture environment-male dominated-hyper competition, constant reorg and new system projects. They pay little and don't have raises, but they will continue to give you more and more of a work load and ask you to take on tasks outside your job description and even hours. It is a miserable place to work and that's why I'm also leaving. It's a job Culture is toxic, discriminatory against women and minorities. They say good things but in practice none of it's true Good company Old but good one. Won’t learn the latest tech but you will work with good people and not be too stressed out. I think it is a good place if you are not too ambitious and want good life balance amazing amazing! i love working here. such a fantastic environment to be a part of. i would definitely recommend working here as i love it so much and it is an extremely productive workplace. everything nothing Highly dependent on team and management. I was fortunate to be put on a good team with good mangement. Unfortunately there's a lot of bureaucracy if you want to get anything done. Upper management is slow to adapt to new technology. It went Downhill and fast. Not even close to the place it was 15 years ago. Was a wonderful place to work in the early 2000's now its just out of touch and they overwork the people they have while management does nothing and makes 10-100x more for no real value. none all Don't bother unless it's a stepping stone for your resume. Constantly overworked, stressed out, toxic environment, and people get promoted based on looks and favoritism. Whenever we ask questions on why something is done or what this report is, the generated answers always seems to be, ""don't worry about it, just punch in the numbers and run the reports."" Hardworking place Tough and fast paced Lots of works and tasks U need to be quick learner to suit the team International exposure Open communication Supportive environment Great Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire. 3 Fugf Decent job and pay is extremely worth some of the hard work they make you endure while working here it is possible that you won’t be able to have free time a lot No Work/life balance The work/life balance isn't great. Overworked and barely take lunch breaks. Upper management is always micromanaging their employees. Overall this place is ok Outsourcing outsourcing outsourcing Company runs in spite of itself. Constant rotation of departments, jobs, and the constant fear of jobs being outsourced make for stressful environment. Overall Good Great culture, but they need to focus on hiring people and rewarding current staff instead of cutting costs. They have not back filled positions leaving people overworked. Productive and Fun Good company with good benefits, Good Work Environment , Supportive Management Great work life balance, diversity, professional growth Company 401K matching at 6%, increasing vacation time with years of service, overtime pay at time and a half Opportunity for internal mobility - Flexible work arrangements and WFH was common, even pre-pandemic Productive and Fun N/a Very stressed work environment with little flexible time management. It's a good place to work for people who does not have kids or is a caregiver. Because of lack of flexibility very rigid environment. The work load is excessively and there is never enough people for the work load. Pregnancy can be very traumatic because there is no special accommodations the expectations is unrealistic when facing all the discomfort and extra self-care. The stress that some pregnant women go through gives a feeling that people are upset at you for being pregnant. The stress seems to be directly causing early contraction some days. Not a good place to go through a pregnancy. Flexibility for vacation should be plan to allow people to take turns for holidays vacation. Or hire more worker to have enough coverage so the workers are not over work and not able to have enough times to travel for the holidays. The blocky days should be dealt differently maybe by giving incentives. Because not everyone needs to travel during the holidays, some people only needs to celebrate locally. We are people working with people consideration should be made to life and family. Values the individual and family because the work atmosphere is very important. Increase productivity creates better place to work. Nobody wants to be working someplace where you are not value and appreciate. The work load in some case is excessively too much. When the preparer are all salary there is not limit and restraint on working time and the expectations is clearly states that working all day all night all weekend is expected to get done! This is not right and does promote s an healthy and equilibrium A grinding work environment Not the best place to work, as most are already aware. The pay is not great, and the work is quite very extensively repetitive. I would not really recommend. Fine Place to Start Out Fine for entry level work. Below average salaries. Not much room for advancement. Day to day tasks are typically mundane. Working with multiple internal teams both onshore and offshore makes it difficult to accomplish anything in a timely manner. Management Intern I enjoyed my time as an intern. I learned a lot of different skills. However, the team is too busy most of the time and I end up having nothing to do. Its an ok place to work. work with intelligent coworkers, friendly too work can be dry at times hours arent too bad difficult onboarding process while remote challenging to train when remote Company expects 24/7 working life Company expects long hours and does not respect your time off as they expect weekend work and will call you while on vacation expecting you to work a full day and still charging for time off Good bonuses. They offer retirement planning and education No work life balance. You are expected to work 24/7 in all job functions., No pay raises you need to negotiate the pay you’ll want up front. Good people work here Great 401k matching, decent benefits, HSA/FSA, backup childcare, the works. The people are nice which is always a good thing. Some teams have heavier workloads than others. The Great Resignation has impacted the company too. Benefits Terrible work environment, terrible work environment and terrible compensation make State Street a bad place to work There is a reason people are constantly leaving, and if they are not leaving, they are being laid off in droves. Terrible management has no idea what they are doing, the work environment is horrendous and everyone is just miserable the whole time. It was such a disaster to work there. Also, the pay is more comparable to retail than to other banks. Occasional free Red Sox games, free access to the MFA Everything else Okay place to work It is a good place to learn but there is poor pay and work/life balance. IT systems are outdated which makes accomplishing different tasks difficult. Benefits, learning opportunities Pay, long hours, outdated IT systems Great place to work Great place to work, Tuition reimbursement, ability to advance career, Manager was great, great location in Boston, near shops, near train, work/life balance. You are just a number. Stay away. You are just a number. Managers lie to get what they want. No ethics. Work is given out without complete requirements. Requirements constantly changing based on the time of day. Upper management very unorganized. Don't trust anything they promise. Look for something else. Easy commute Poor pay, poor benefits, a manager will say anything but will not back it up with action. Low pay, low mobility, nebulous expectations Benefits used to be fantastic, but they've been whittled down over the years. There's no standardized promotion schedule, no standardized raise schedule (not even to beat inflation), no accountability or transparency. Salary is below market, but further below market for some. No internal investigations into pay equity or fairness. There is so much turn-over, that positions rarely have a standard set of expectations (be ready to be ""adaptive""--perform 2-4 roles for the same salary). Performance reviews are performed by the managers, with little to no employee input, with no clarity on standards. It's a free-for-all, and largely dependent on budgetary constraints. During COVID, the expectation was to be constantly available, and at short notice. Sales teams under a lot of pressure. Support teams shrunk. Flexible work arrangements but that’s the only positive. Company is offshoring everything to India. Only cares about saving money, not about producing quality service to our clients. Upper management doesn’t respond to employee questions/concerns like they used to. SSB used to be a great place to work, now I wouldn’t recommend it to an enemy. Flexible work arrangement Job security, pay, lack of bonuses for 3 years now, broken systems. Monotonous work, decent pay, good benefits & PTO Monotonous work, decent pay, good benefits & PTO. Day to day experience really depends on your direct supervisor. There are good people working there. The company is large enough that there are always open positions, movement within the company is supported. Good benefits, Pto Monotonous work Too big to fail Poor processes and poor management. No formal documentation or onboarding. No real accountability. Constantly reorganizing rather than focusing on process structure and discipline. People want to do good job Lacking structure, poor management. Health benefits worst of any company I have worked for. Great Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire. 3 Great local managers, good pay and benefits, bad CEO I enjoyed the people worked with directly. Did not trust executive management. They only care about today's stock price. Layoffs whenever they saw the price drop. Great local managers, good pay and benefits bad CEO and executives Okay place to intern Mundane work culture, everyone seemed bored of their job. Not everyone was friendly. Dreaded going into work everyday. Below average pay and strict corporate culture. Large company, Nice People (mostly), decent pay, Flexible environment, Inefficient management, Too slow in everything, frustrating often Enjoyed my time in the company with some good people who have been there for several years. They are nice , helpful and understand the constraints of the organization. New management coming from outside expect a lot but are not able to navigate the organization that is complex and be supportive of the people to achieve the goals. Blame goes around easily than taking responsibility. Felt many a time that the senior management bites more than it can chew and the employees are always working too hard ( in pockets) to make their manager happy but in vain. Flexible, respectful culture, decent compensation Too many conflicting priorities and inefficiencies, managers surround themselves with sycophants State Street Started My Career Grateful for the opportunity to advance and transition my career from law enforcement into financial services. Be advised continuous layoffs so always be on the lookout for opportunities. Constantly understaffed Teams were constantly understaffed which resulted in longer hours and high stress of among remaining team. It was hard to maintain a work life balance. Company has changed, no longer enjoy working at STT Overworked, short staffed, high amount of stress translate into difficult working at STT. Company has lost focus and does not appreciate employees feedback. Health benefits expensive and providing minimal coverage, same as other custodian Banks. Lack of clear direction at CXO levels... Salary every two weeks Short staffed, Indecisive, outsourcing jobs overseas, benefits expensive Not terrible not great Overall working there was an ok experience. The majority of the time there it felt like I was a glorified button presser. The compensation was also very low compared to similar companies. Good Place to work Great place to work. I have no issues working here. Everyone is awesome. Great staff. Not too stressful. Team work environment. If you ever need help with anything someone is always willing to help. Remote, Work isnt too hard low pay Good work environment / poor pay - State Street is a great place to work if you like fast pace environment. - The Company works on Inclusion of all people. - Very good training program - The company support women and mothers in business. However, the pay is not competitive. Horrible pay. Excellent training, inclusion, support women and mothers in Business. Very bad pay Captive Good comapny to work for. Great perks. Free cab.. cancelcsb and you will b given 3500 pemnth above CTC. Good hikes good managers and lastly good teams and high class tech strong teams Free lunch No cons Good start place Good job for right after college. It will look good on a resume down the road. Most people move up or out after a year. Every Friday we had cake because someone was leaving. Experience Stress Good overall gain Good place to gain some knowledge but difficult to move up within the same department. Compensation was the biggest issue compared to similar positions in the industry. Knowledge to be gained if you try and work a little extra to acheive it Comoensation was weak compared to other places and internal growth was lacking Worked with great people-Fun Office I worked at a satellite office in CA. The office management was awesome. The people I worked and interacted with were amazing. I started in entry level and worked my way up the corporate ladder. I worked in the company for many years because there were so many challenges and opportunities for me. One of the best places I've ever worked! Professional atmosphere, casual dress code, advancement opportunities stressful month ends Future outlook for the company is great The goals set for the next 5 years are very innovative in nature. They are working with new technology and implementing new automation tools to better improve efficiency. Opportunities to learn something new Compensation does not match the market Not forthcoming with information in a timely manner. No work life balance to speak of, but they try to pride themselves in it when it really is non- existent. They tried to show support for those not comfortable commuting and working in The office, but they also have an agenda to get x amount of employees back in the office by a certain date, but they don’t disclose that to the employees. Sr. Management operates like old countries used to, the kings and queens get the riches but the workers and employees are the one’s who do the bulk of the hard work, but they aren’t well compensated for their efforts or the 60 to 70 hour weeks they work for a mediocre salary. None Work you to the bone and then get rid of you. Funny Co worker It is really really easy to move up at this company, You can become a vice president pretty quickly. Pay is pretty awful and raises are also awful. Good starter job. Good work/life balance I have been able to grow with the company. Pre pandemic I had a scheduled work from home day and when pandemic hit, I was already familiar with working remotely and the transition was seemless. Unfortunately many jobs are being offshored. Flexible work schedules, not much equality Many departments have flexible work arrangements, but not all managers are flexible. There are still many silos that exist, so one just has to put their best foot forward and make the most of their personal experience. The company offers many training courses to stimulate growth (career and personal), but your networks may get you farther than your experience. Flexibily Growth, advancement Depends on your department and division Best part of the job were coworkers. Magament would shut thier office door and were not approachable or available. Asked for a Human Resotces contact and was instructed to check the corporate intranet site. Good Place to Work As with any job, there are pros and cons, but it is a great place to learn and develop as a professional. Management seems to actually care about their staff and listen to people’s needs. Great Wonderful place to work. Learned alot of new things. Internal customer service was great. Alot of growth opportunities. Great career path to take and to retire. 3 Great company and people Great company and people! Advancement opportunities are available. Find your opportunity to make an impact and learn as much as possible along the way. Thank you for your review. We are thrilled that you appreciate the learning and development opportunities State Street offers. I have also found that managers here at State Street really make an effort to foster an inclusion environment focused on professional growth and learning. Garrett, Global Clients Division Flex time Flex time I’d great; compensation is poor. And always need to look over shoulder for job security. Lots of bureaucratic nonsense and politics gets in the way of getting stuff done. Cut cost so much there isn’t more left for needed improvements Nothing Nithing Hours can tend to be longer..but great job! State Street offers good pay, and benefits to their employees, hours can be long usually depending on market activities. The environment requires people with the ability to solve problems, meet deadlines and strong attention to detail. Good benefits, good compensation, learning environment longer usual hours Management does not care. Period. Management does not care. Period. Management asks for a lot, gives little back in return. Advancement is limited. Pay could be better for the work performed. Good stepping stone to a financial career Good stepping stone to a financial career. Work/life balance is out of synch. Management has no clue with highly unrealistic expectation. No annual increase in salary level. Productive It was good. At first it felt a bit intimidating because everyone expected a lot from you but eventually the workload became manageable. The team i worked with was great and my manager was always attentive and made sure everyone had support if needed with their workload. Free meals at times A lot of work but manageble Good place to get your foot through the door. There is not much room to grow. The work is repetitive. Your experience depends on if you land on a good team or not. The hours are also not so great. Salary is too low for the amount of responsibility and work load you are given. The salary is not motivating and the only way you can make a check is to work a lot of overtime. You are constantly changing broker accounts. Once you become familiar with how to best manage a fund they take it from you and give it to someone else. They have a very high supervisor turnover rate so that can be very frustrating. Loved the Kansas City Facility, great cafeteria, friendly environment... Stressful, unfair pay, high Supervisor turnover rate Productive It was good. At first it felt a bit intimidating because everyone expected a lot from you but eventually the workload became manageable. The team i worked with was great and my manager was always attentive and made sure everyone had support if needed with their workload. Free meals at times A lot of work but manageble Great co-workers The focus of the company is misplaced and what works on paper but not on what works operationally. Outsourcing and a push for lower cost has degraded the service the company can provide to their clients. There is a severe lack of depth to the applications and processes due to the extremely large outsourcing that has been done over the last 5-10 years. Jobs Outsourced Jobs get outsourced and the company makes you feel relatively unimportant and just another number. The people I worked with was the best part about working for State Street. Productive and technically encouraging environment A very technically strong and learning working culture with utmost diversity and fun culture to uplift the mood of the employees. A great place to learn a lot of new things. Good management very less team meetings STT Blues Your DIRECT Management persecutes you and tries to find ways to trip you up so they look good or find an operational error - no support - no management. Some of the traders are cool Hostile work environment (2018-2020) Poor Management The leadership is non-existent in the Kansas City office and some groups have multiple managing director's who are poor leaders and lack basic planning skills. good profit sharing Poor management and leadership Friendly and professional place to work. Enjoyable working environment, professional people, interesting place to work; I had great coworkers -- fun, caring and appreciative of my work. I learned a lot about Exchange Traded Funds, financial markets and investing. state street state street os a great company to work for. people are friendly and there is a sense of purpose at work. management is also very helpful. and you can learn a lot. ok sometimes not ok Pay the bills Too stress and unprofessional management. Dead end place and no future... If you can't find job, it's ok to take the offered. Ask people around and find out more yourself. Free parking No respect Good intro to financial sector, but wrecked with poor management and morale Pros: -Generous time off -Work from home flexibility even before COVID hit Cons: -Very hierarchical and bureaucratic even with layoffs and smaller teams -Poor collaboration across teams, and within them. -High turnover, including some of the few genuinely capable managers getting fed up and going. -No real company culture at all. The company’s leadership is constantly introducing new initiatives that don’t really go anywhere. -Constant cost cutting and threat of layoffs. Don’t expect any pay raise or advancement. Decent place to get your feet wet right out of college If this company took more of an interest in its employees, compensated them better, provided them with better technology and a more inviting/exciting office culture, the retention rate would be much higher and people would feel proud to work there. Management/employee disconnect is a huge problem there. You feel like just a number, just another cog in the wheel. Work life balance, work from home, benefits, flexibility Low pay, zero training, high workload volume year round, outdated technology, poor communication across big company, management disconnected from employee success Good starter job, but most leave Good starter job, but most leave. Expected to work overtime, dont mind that so much with OT pay, but it can get very draining. Will only really hire people when absolutely necessary. Your experience mainly depends on which team you are on. Some teams are great, others not so much."

Management, people, environment very beautiful- Novanta has the best ice maker ever- What is the most stressful part about working at the company? The company is big which means a lot of responsibilities- Employees must be dedicated and work hard even if it requires extra hours after work time- What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Novanta is a people place, they put people first- What is a typical day like for you at the company? Always busy Great leaders! This company wants you to grow and learn within. Management really cares about your success and growth. Great benefits and PTO. The commitment to diversity is important for Novanta. Work/Life Balance, Enjoyable Workplace Culture, No Micromanaging N/a Stay away They have A LOT of employee turnover due to the horrible culture. Management provides no support, has no interest in changing and you'll be in meetings all day. You constantly get conflicting information on how to complete a task and when you need help, you get no response for days if you are lucky. They have no procedures in place, at least none that anyone follows. You have to access multiple systems to get info you need and the info is never correct. They lure you in with a big salary and great benefits. I would never recommend this company to anyone. When I got hired on the whole team was new because everyone left. Our direct boss ended up quitting and same with the VP. The place is a black hole that will just grind you down. good benefits package. no professionalism, lots of cronyism. Nothing is written down, no procedures. The lifers that have been there for over 20 years protect themselves by keeping the product knowledge to themselves. This is how the keep their jobs. I was hired for 2nd shift. two weeks later they cancel 2nd shift and give us the choice of going to first or getting laid off!! Great benefits package. No job security, brown nosing and then back stabbing. Simply management talk and plenty of circus acts. Stand up meetings all over the place. Nothing comes out in action. The test equipment is totally outdated and no spare equipment. Everyone in management is a fire fighter. Any and all meetings are just talk with the brunt of the real work thrust on the manufacturing floor employees. Backstabbing all around and meaningless promotions of the inner cronies. My typical day at work starts with the same disaster as last week with some equipment down (again). There are no funds funneled into equipment upgrades because there are no upgrades available with outdated electronics that stopped being manufactured decades ago. There are no pros anymore. The company sits where Polaroid was when I left them! Really bad management that only talk and think they make a difference. Always busy Lots of work. Very repetitive. Good health care. Good supervisors. Offer overtime, 401k and paid vacation. Convenient location. Engineers willing to help. Good coworkers Changes seem good in theory but lack input from people doing the work. Friendly Folks, Poor Vision & Resources People here are great! Diverse group in the work force, not so much for salaried folk. Management lacks the vision to hire adequate resources; won't reduce duplication of effort. Just stay away Top management is very bad. They obtain huge bonuses and at the same time the rest of company didn't even know what bonusesbat Novanta were. Unfortunately their bad reputation is well known among neighboring companies. Stressful place to work Stressful place to work due to poor middle management. High RMA returns due to poor quality. Unable to maintain a timely product flow through production due to poor material procurement practices. Bonus Program Poor Management Q.ci CELERA MOTION High Precision Optical Encoders, Robust Inductive Encoders, High Precision / Efficiency Motors, High Performance Servo Drives, Integrated Mechatronic Solutions, High Speed Air Bearing Spindles Great work environment, nice people Managed activities in Materials, Manufacturing and Quality overseeing manufacturing personnel, ensuring timely shipment and meeting quality and cost objectives. Provided professional customer interface, plant tours, presentations, quotations and RMA. Provided plant-wide leadership for Lean, 5S and Process Improvement Team (PIT). • A lot of improvements needed This place needs a lot of work and improvement everywhere and it's hard to solve a problem when each one is a priority. This company is a baby compared to other companies. Processes and standard procedures are outdated. Its a big mess that needs to be cleaned up. Always new faces in management. Every year there's a new manager so far and I have been at Novanta for 5 years. Great people to work with Management, no bonuses, poor reviews and no room for advancement Nice office Amazing forward moving products to get excited about. Many bright, enthusiastic employees who work hard and smart but have learned to keep their heads down to survive in a tough environment. Top heavy with individuals who don't respect employees or even acknowledge when you say hello. Mean school girl mentality at the C and Management level. Forward moving products and technology Disrespectful, harsh culture Owner is great This is a great business with great employees. The owner is very personable and works very hard himself. This was a great job opportunity and the only reason for leaving I had was to pursue my education. Good place to gain experience I enjoy my job at Jadak however I feel its time to take my experience on to greater pastures hopefully not to my regret, but in life you must take chances sometime, no problem with the company great place to work as long as you focus!!! Love my Job Back Biting and adolecent behavior Definitely a typical cutthroat east coast company. This review is for the Rocklin site. No bonuses, no stock options. No coffee machines, the coffee that is provided is 'choc full of nutz' and tastes like toilet water. This company has circus like local operations mgt. And the executive leadership in Bedford mass are the typical east coast cronies. So unless you are from one of their alma maters or worked with them at a previous company, i.e. perkin elmer, you are nobody. None A lot Jadak (A Novanta Company) Jadak (a Novanta Company) has excellent people, but is experiencing a good amount of cultural changes within the organization. Great technology and significant upside opportunity for growth. People, Technology Leadership, Culture Tbd Work is a combination of collaborating across many muti-functional groups involved in growing the business. People are incentivized to work with customers and solve customer problems Great company So far so good here and collaborative teams, nice people and a growing company with great benefits and excellent competitive salaries. The teams here are helpful land this place is just an all around nice place to work with a nice atmosphere and environment. Great benefits, competitive salary, location Look at the people leaving It is almost unbelievable how many people have left on their own free will. It has been a mass exodus since April 2017. ALL of the replacement management team has been brought in from one company. Why are people leaving? People receiving promotions are at best, marginal for the role, but keeping costs down when you can't hit quarterly numbers is important to receiving your bonus. Don't hire the capable.

Great team to work with , with a lot of experience and skills. 7 great place to work and great quality product.. insecure manager and leads very fair in most areas.... insecure lower management.... against each other... engineering leadership very set on his ways... been there too long and has lost interest but only shows that side to the engineers, is completely different around upper management, prod floor leads the hims and hers are so two faced, or insecure or just rude... growing company but needs to focus on getting some right people in leadership roles, doesnt accept change at all hope they can figure it out. They have a great product need to change processes to keep up with the volume so the percentage of happy customers exceeds the upset customers. great product and founder/ owner very smart and caring drama with lower management ...insecure staff and leads 5 Adore Management tres entreprenant Bonne culture du résultat . Performance de l'entreprise Company has overall professional strategy No training program. Expected to learn on your own while managing large book of business. Poor management on existing programs. Large focus on new business letting partners feel neglected. Great product portfolio Management Great Times At Work A typical day at Novanta was providing great customer service with a smile. I worked the cash register, so I was the first and last person people would see. In other words, I was the ""face"" of the business, if I provided excellent service, people would want to come back! I learned how to efficiently work a cash register, a little bit of Spanish, and a lot about Neapolitan Pizza! It was wonderful working with the managment and all of my co-workers, we all formed a great bond(inside and outside of work), and also worked very well together! I do not believe there was any ""hard"" part of this job, occasionally we would have an unhappy customer here and there, but I learned how to meet their expectations and make sure that they are satisfied! The most enjoyable part was working with my wonderful coworkers, and also with customers! It was great seeing customers come back, and also new faces, but either way they were always very excited to be there. 2 stars What is the best part of working at the company?

Management really cares about your success and growth. Great benefits and PTO. The commitment to diversity is important for Novanta. Work/Life Balance, Enjoyable Workplace Culture, No Micromanaging N/a Stay away They have A LOT of employee turnover due to the horrible culture. Management provides no support, has no interest in changing and you'll be in meetings all day. You constantly get conflicting information on how to complete a task and when you need help, you get no response for days if you are lucky. They have no procedures in place, at least none that anyone follows. You have to access multiple systems to get info you need and the info is never correct. They lure you in with a big salary and great benefits. I would never recommend this company to anyone. When I got hired on the whole team was new because everyone left. Our direct boss ended up quitting and same with the VP. The place is a black hole that will just grind you down. good benefits package. no professionalism, lots of cronyism. Nothing is written down, no procedures. The lifers that have been there for over 20 years protect themselves by keeping the product knowledge to themselves. This is how the keep their jobs. I was hired for 2nd shift. two weeks later they cancel 2nd shift and give us the choice of going to first or getting laid off!! Great benefits package. No job security, brown nosing and then back stabbing. Simply management talk and plenty of circus acts. Stand up meetings all over the place. Nothing comes out in action. The test equipment is totally outdated and no spare equipment. Everyone in management is a fire fighter. Any and all meetings are just talk with the brunt of the real work thrust on the manufacturing floor employees. Backstabbing all around and meaningless promotions of the inner cronies. My typical day at work starts with the same disaster as last week with some equipment down (again). There are no funds funneled into equipment upgrades because there are no upgrades available with outdated electronics that stopped being manufactured decades ago. There are no pros anymore. The company sits where Polaroid was when I left them! Really bad management that only talk and think they make a difference. Always busy Lots of work. Very repetitive. Good health care. Good supervisors. Offer overtime, 401k and paid vacation. Convenient location. Engineers willing to help. Good coworkers Changes seem good in theory but lack input from people doing the work. Friendly Folks, Poor Vision & Resources People here are great! Diverse group in the work force, not so much for salaried folk. Management lacks the vision to hire adequate resources; won't reduce duplication of effort. Just stay away Top management is very bad. They obtain huge bonuses and at the same time the rest of company didn't even know what bonusesbat Novanta were. Unfortunately their bad reputation is well known among neighboring companies.

Every year there's a new manager so far and I have been at Novanta for 5 years. Great people to work with Management, no bonuses, poor reviews and no room for advancement Nice office Amazing forward moving products to get excited about.

Grant Street Group|" good work ethics working to help client to stay clean and focus on the future. provide client center treatment. my co workers are good hard working people that care. 11 35 Great culture, excellent coworkers Grant Street group is an excellent place to work if you're comfortable setting your own priorities, balancing multiple projects, and wearing a lot of hats. Your coworkers will be smart and eager to lend a hand - but you need to ask for help when you need it or you will sink. Nobody expects or wants you to work more than 40 hours outside of travel time for implementation projects, but it is easy to get overloaded if you don't communicate with your team. Management is super transparent. I have a lot of respect for leadership at the company. Good compensation, benefits getting better every year, great happy to provide whatever technology you need to work efficiently Growing pains, teams self-organize and some lack process new hires need 5 Love the work I do, who I do it with, and the life it enables me to have outside of work Amazing people, surprisingly team-y culture despite all the remote workers, and legitimate work life balance (working 40+ hours per week is frowned upon on most teams). The owners are passionate that employees are happy, customers are more than satisfied, and that our product works better than any competitor. GSG holds its employees (and interview candidates) to high standards. I know that my co-workers will get their jobs done and get them done right - and more importantly, I'm confident they will seek help when they need it. The same goes for myself. I've never felt like the culture was cut-throat or high pressure at all despite our high expectations; we share credit in our successes and in our shortcomings. My career path here is essentially ""whatever I need it to be."" GSG hires great people and - in my experience - we do our best to put people in roles where they will exceed expectations. If you care deeply about having ""Sr."" or ""Manager"" or ""VP"" in your job title or if you are highly motivated by moving up the ranks in a hierarchy, GSG may not be the place for you. I work best knowing I'll be evaluated by the quality of my work and my team's work instead of my title or tenure, and that's a huge reason why I love working here. I'd say my salary is fair and the benefits are amazing. I made a similar salary doing similar work at my previous job, but I was stressed and often wasted my evenings and Sundays dreading work the next day. My happiness here is well worth the trade-off in salary I could have earned elsewhere. It was life-changing to get rid of the looming 10 Great Culture and Coworkers Grant Street Group has been an amazing place to work. Here, more than any other company I have ever worked for, people want you to succeed. Company leadership is focused on putting you in the best possible position to be happy and successful. Pay is at or above industry standard, same with benefits (which they improve every year), but it is the people here that truly make this place stand out. The work itself tends to be challenging, but enjoyable. You need to be a self-motivated problem solver to thrive here. I waited quite some time to write this review, as I wanted to be sure that this company's culture is legitimate and not a facade. I can say with certainty now that it is. If you want to work somewhere that doesn't treat you like a number on the bottom line, this is the place. Horrible Management The management team would benefit from some Leadership counseling. There is no work/life balance like they claim. Different people are treated worse than others. They take advantage of new college graduates. They don't respect expertise. Work from home Poor management Terrible Working Experience Stressful with little to no support for employees. Absolutely no training which leads to wide variances in employee work and confusion about roles in general. Outstanding software development firm. This was a part-time consulting position after retirement from the firm.

Direct Supply|" Productive and Strong Work Environment with good Work/life Balance Goals are fair and company understands changes in the market may affect your numbers. Clear trajectory if you wish to stay in sales, and very strong management. 1 Great Company, terrible leadership. The good: Employee owned. You do receive stock and get a payout once a year. The pay was pretty good and the overall culture was very fun. Quarterly meetings with catered dinner. Free fitness center on campus. Beautiful campus. Every building has a kitchen with a fridge (or 2 ) stocked full of free beverages, a coffee machine (that makes fancy coffee) popcorn and pretzels. Dog friendly campus! The bad: location is horrible! Right in the middle of a rough neighborhood and right across from a trash site (got many nails and screws in my tires going to/from work. Leadership is very persnickety about “perception”. If you’re perceived as young and naive they will never take you seriously. Any complaint you may receive (could be about anything) HR will do an internal investigation. If you’re not very well liked at the company and they can’t get any “dirt” on you during the investigation they will still let you go and chalk it up as “integrity concerns”. Small but fun Great mission and culture. Too dependent on ceo and needs to diversify as he’s getting near retirement. Not as progressive as other tech companies.. None None Innovative Company with a Great Mission and Partnership Focused Culture Direct Supply is an amazing company to work for with a great work life balance. There is a ton of flexibility and focus on just getting your work done and not a lot of micromanagement. At Direct Supply, networking is encouraged and the ability to forge your own unique career path is available. Salary to start may be a little low depending on the role, but the opportunity for advancement, mentorship opportunties, and total compensation make up for that and much more. Direct Supply is an employee owned company with a great culture, long tenured employees and plenty of opportunity. They have a very entreprenueral culture that is focused on innovation and problem solving for their customers. The management team is great and has a focus on the future growth of the company and it's employees. Culture, Career Opportunities, Mission Driven, Work Life Balance, Innovative, Total Compensation, Stock Program Salary Culture is Key Direct Supply has a great culture! People who have been with the company for 20+ years are still as excited to work there as they were from day 1. There are several individuals willing to help you grow and be a mentor. Networking, Community Invovlement, Healthcare, Gym N/a Great culture and flexibility, lower average pay made up for in benefits. Overall this is a great company to work for, they care for their partners and make sure that everyone is fulfilled in their role and has areas to advance within the company. Overall the salary is lower than market average in many positions, but the benefits (401K, flexible work schedule, healthcare, casual dress code, perks, etc) help to offset this. The paid time off is also very generous even from day one. There's lots of opportunity to grow within the company, and you're able to take your career path and development in to your own hands. Direct Supply's culture is unmatched (and I have worked at other large organizations in the Greater Milwaukee area). They could improve at compensation and advancement for their highest performing partners. Benefits, culture, Pto, flexibility, autonomy, caring Compensation Focused on Professional Development My role at Direct Supply is unique. The Rotational Development Program is a two-year program consisting of four-month rotations across several lines of business. As an employee owned company, Direct Supply invests in its partners. Being a recent college graduate, the program has been a great fit in terms of professional development. employee owned, strong mission, professional development Employee-owned company that cares Direct Supply is an employee-owned company where employees really are treated like partners. This mentality originates from the Founder, CEO and President of Direct Supply, Bob Hillis. Bob leads by example. He genuinely cares about every partner and the senior living industry that we serve. The principles that Bob has set trickle down to every department within Direct Supply and have set the foundation for every aspect of my work. It is a huge motivator for me in sales. The caring culture carries through all levels within Direct Supply. Management has always been supportive and encouraging when it comes to career development. They make it clear that they want you to be truly happy and successful in your job at Direct Supply, whether that means developing and growing in your current role, or moving to other areas within the Business. Not only does Direct Supply care about me as an employee, but me as a person too. With things like the new Champion Wellness Center, options to work remote and taking tremendous steps to make sure our Campus is the safest it can be amidst COVID-19, they genuinely care about my well-being and safety. Employee owned, Champion Wellness Center--free for me and my spouse, free beverages, remote work options Great partner/owner culture, entrepreneurial leadership, important and easy-to-support business vision I work in IT on cross functional project teams and love the opportunity to work with a variety of smart partners on solving pertinent problems to our business. My expertise and critical thinking skills are challenged daily, and I enjoy the company vision behind it all. Employees are truly the biggest asset here, and a culture of partnership, coaching, learning and improvement are there for the taking. While work life balance is a struggle, it is because I enjoy the work I do. Comfort perks are great, too. leadership vision, ownership culture, benefits, campus, bring your dog to work, learning environment work life balance can easily be a struggle to achieve as there is a lot of opportunity Great company culture with opportunities for advancement I am a Senior Operations Specialist at Direct Supply, and a member of the Building Services Operations Team. I work with our customers and service providers to coordinate a wide variety of services at senior living communities. Since starting at Direct Supply, I have learned how important the work we do is to improving the standard of living for the seniors we serve. Over the last three years my responsibilities have continued to change as our business has grown, and as I was promoted from an Operations Specialist, to Operations Specialist II, to Senior Operations Specialist. I have enjoyed the employee ownership culture, collaborative work environment, and challenging opportunities that continue to push me. A day in the life a Direct Supply includes collaborating across many parts of the business, working with customers, interfacing with technology, and possibly even making it over to the Wellness Center (gym) or Joule Cafe. Direct Supply is a great company if you are looking for a place to call home and have a rewarding career. Culture, advancement, great campus, new technology, employee owned. Partners and Customers are a Priority! It is so rewarding to work for a company that is committed to taking care of their partners (Company is employee-owned so employees are considered partners). Each person is valued and apprciated for their contributions which inspires you to continue to work hard. That happens not only from leadership, but partner to partner. I can truly say that there is no other company that I've worked for that embodies 'delivering outrageous customer service' more than Direct Supply. Our mission and priority of taking care of Seniors is evident in every action we take. Caring for Partners and Customers, Work-life Balance, Partners are Appreciated and Valued, Visionary Leadership, Opportunities for Growth and Advancement Compensation lags behind other companies Exciting work environment with great opportunity for career growth If you are looking for a place to call your work home for the rest of your professional career, look no further. Direct Supply boasts strong employee retention numbers because of the unique company culture and the company leadership's overall desire to see you improve. This is not a work environment where you simply ""get through the day"" or slack off. Direct Supply upholds high standards for its partner employees because they are ultimately its stakeholders, and what determines the success of the business and its impact in the senior living industry. If you are also looking for a workplace with a sense of strong purpose and identity, Direct Supply is an excellent choice. Our core principles are engrained within our everyday tasks and the energy within my team, specifically, is unmatched. I would recommend Direct Supply as an employer for any hard-working, driven individual who is looking to progress in their career and ultimately contribute to a bigger picture. Lots of free food, games, grill outs, awesome fieldhouse/gym, and local food vendors onsite every week, also employee discounts at places like Costco and with other appliance companies Sometime struggles with work/life balance Excellent company to work for Remotely Enjoyed working with the guys in my team, strong communication is there and so is help, if you need it, Each day we did scrum and then off to my desk (at home) to complete my tasks. Stress Free environment They might let you go no matter how well you perform if you are a contract employee. Fun work Environment with a Unique Culture Direct Supply has a great culture where they emphasize a work/life balance. They also, allow for early growth within the ""career ladder"". With that said, you do get to a point where career progression comes to what feels like a ""standstill"". Also, the compensation packages appear to be a bit lower than the industry standard. Awesome People, Hard Work. This is a very demanding place to work. It is not easy work and requires much of the employee, however, the people are amazing. There is so much support within Direct Supply and they are very flexible with hours. I was really proud working with the people here and working for this company. Productive and fun workplace. Maximized efficiency of processes across the company as well as supporting all daily trading operations by performing analysis on business processes, writing work instructions, and working with executives on projects and initiatives. Fun Workplace, Good people The people at DS are some of the kindest, nicest people you'll ever meet. My direct manager was amazing and my dev lead was likewise FANTASTIC. The hard part (at least for me) was the pay--I worked hard and was there for 1.5 years while being a full-time student and never received a raise up from the base intern pay. All in all, if you get an offer here and want to work with fantastic people and enjoy a fun workplace, SAY YES! If you are in it only for the money, say no. Nice people The people who work here are really nice. They try their best to help you through problems in day to day work. Very collaborative. The campus is cool. DS takes care of their partners It was a great office with great people. I was happy to serve the other “partners”, as all employees are partners in the company. Many employee perks, like snacks, drinks, an hour for lunch, and you can rack up as much overtime as you want. I worked in the Campus Operations department. Awesome culture where the employees come first Just a wonderful place to work where everyone is friendly and willing to help each other out. Managers and executive level employees go out of there way to give opportunities to all employees Too Many Meetings I want to give a higher mark for work/life balance, but I can't. With all the meetings you are expected to attend it makes it VERY difficult to get any of your job done at work. The daily work doesn't stop when you are in meetings. Many nights multiple hours of work at home are required. Work load piles on with little help from bringing on new people. More and more work is handed out as hiring is at a snail's pace. Productive and Strong Work Environment with good Work/life Balance Goals are fair and company understands changes in the market may affect your numbers. Clear trajectory if you wish to stay in sales, and very strong management. 1 Great company but lack of advancement opportunity is a issue Everything from the culture to the benefits and the other partners is great. I like working here but I want to advance my career and there is just no opportunity in my field. Benefits, culture, teamwork, schedule Advancement and management 2 Good Place to Work Good place to have a reliable job and positive work environment. Little micro-management. The company is well established and will continue to grow in its' market. Very little opportunity to grow your skills. Most people I see in higher level positions either had someone above them get fired/leave, or were there for 7+ years. 1 A company that genuinely stands by its employees I would recommend this workplace to anyone. They are committed to their employees, and pride themselves on retention. The benefits are also very competitive, Wonderful time I would recommend interning at Direct Supply. My manager was amazing and taught me a lot. The team I worked with always did their best to help me and always made time for me. Great Management, Appreciation, Learning Only located in Milwaukee Direct Supply Although my internship was helpful in providing good experience, Direct Supply was not high on my list for places to work for. Management was not good. DS Review Great company for security and consistency when raising a family. They do a good job taking care of their employee's need's, as long as you continually subscribe to the 'mission'. Gym Expectations Great Culture There is definitely a lack of diversity and its hard to move around as a woman, but if leadership likes you...the possibilities for advancement are there. Challenging and dynamically changing environment. Good culture, very young company. I watched the company change from a small company (230) to a midsized company (over a 1000 employees). Lots of dynamic change. Unfortunately worked in an area that was internal support for the organization; not profit generating. As such we did not get more staff when the workload increased. There was no ratio of support staff to workers. Support staff was expected to take up the slack. Free Soda, Dogs at Work Hard work that favors young ambition over work/family balance. The Google of Milwaukee Great Place to work. Stocked Fridges with free refreshments. I had no gripes with the company. They allowed me to spread my wings and do tasks well beyond my job description. Productive sales atmosphere Direct Supply is a sales oriented work place. Engineering is not there stronges entity. But is a fun work place with many great people. Management is working through better process of improvements but are not there yet. Rapidly Growing Employee Owned Company Senior Living focused power house provide elegant solutions across the United States and Canada. Great place for entry level folks looking for a challenging and rewarding environment. Great place ... but the culture is changing! It's sad about the change. Wonderful people and many great memories... Mid-Managers will get very cut throat to get to that Director spot. It's sad the amount of people gone! Decent Job - Nothing Spectacular Worked about 9 hours a day, 5 days a week - had major holidays off. Management was friendly. It was very much a drink the kool-aid or don't fit in type place. Could bring dogs to work on Fridays. Got to work remote occasionally. Family/Team atmosphere, wonderful place to work The culture at Direct Supply is very conducive to growth. There is a heavy emphasis on work/life balance there. Help for your career is always available. Ok place to work. Coworkers were very easy to work with. Never got hired on so I do not know about benefits. Managment could have been better. Enjoyed the working environment. Enjoyed customers. Productive and fast-paced work environment A typical work day can be very different from day-to-day. Emergencies or problems with your projects can happen like anywhere, which can lead to a crazy day sometimes. The people are all nice to work with and management is on top of things but a lot of people feel they do not get paid enough for the stress of this job and for how much they need to work to complete their tasks. Benefits, company-owned On-call shifts Typical work day At Direct Supply you are required to hit 6 hours logged in on the phone, 2 hours of talk time, 30 calls a day. With that you are also required to make calls to customers that don't want to do business with Direct Supply when you start out; that will change when you get placed in a territory. Great relaxed place to work Direct Supply is a great place to work. The people there are very friendly and helpful, the pay is good, they allow pets, and my favorite motto of the company is ""Work Hard, Play Hard."" Very Stressful job!!! They would like you to deliver sheet rock and tiles& cabinets to the third floor by yourself no helper ?? imagine doing that all day! then when you think your done for the day?? can you do pick up's? None!! Excellent Place to work Top notch culture with numerous career opportunities. Salary and benefits are very strong. Executive team could use some coaching on how to align and execute strategy. On site gym and snack bars provide for improved work/life balance, Middle and Senior Management are compassionate and responsible. Executive Leadership team is stuck in gridlock Productive and Strong Work Environment with good Work/life Balance Goals are fair and company understands changes in the market may affect your numbers. Clear trajectory if you wish to stay in sales, and very strong management. 1 Well known Direct supply was a very unique company to work for. I would compare it best to a Silicon Valley operation. It was a lot of fun but there was a lot of changes in the management and the focus. 2 4 Pfi I thoroughly enjoyed working with the staff at PFI and the Corp team was fantastic. They offered multiple learning opportunities, but again there was no room for advancement. 2 2 Great place to work hard and play hard Bring your positive energy and make a difference in the lives of our nations seniors. Great culture-- super positive-- high energy work place. The employee owned aspect of this company provides a key component to creating one of the best workplaces I've ever enjoyed. Fun workplace We would have weekly office parties whenever we met our sales goals the previous week. Commission was fair. Pay was weekly...Just a shame that the owner sold the company. It was never the same after that. Amazing Great culture. Lots of opportunity to move internally within the company. CEO focuses on blue ocean strategy to ensure they survive in the market. Highly recommended. Great starter job for low level candidate I don't recommend applying unless you are young, single and don't mind low pay. This is a good job for someone just out of college. It also might be a good fit if you have a special skill they are looking for. If you come in mid career, don't expect much. They will work you like a dog. The way they choose candidates for leadership roles is ridiculous and most of them are ineffective and have no clue what they are doing. Free Soda & LaCroix Too many to list Software Engineering Burnout and Reorganization Engineering at Direct Supply has recently has turned into a ""feature-factory-motivated"" endless workday that is driving the top talent to look at other opportunities. Leadership believes that no one will leave the company and has acted accordingly with how they treat their engineers. It has not been uncommon to come into work early, be asked to stay late, and sign back online for a release when you get home. A 12-hour day has started to become the norm with no additional compensation or benefit to the engineers themselves. Every one in a while leadership tries to show appreciation, but appreciation only goes far when they continue to push us to extremes. Direct management doesn't care or doesn't have the power to push back on unrealistic expectations set by upper management. Upper management at one point this past year asked everyone to do an engagement survey (potentially since they knew morale was low) and then completely disregarded the results and increased the workload on their engineering teams under the guise of their yearly event. Instead of changing their business practices, leadership doubled down and blamed the engineers for their performance and opted to just reorganize structure rather than look at their business practices. The latest change publicly took senior engineers and replaced them with business people in an effort to drive more work and increase quality. However, the quality and output that the engineering teams can create is continuing to fall and leadership refuses to admit they made a mistake. There is little confidence from me Free pizza downtown, a bar, foosball table, shuffleboard, profit sharing. Very long hours, no work-life balance, bad senior management forecasting, unhelpful middle management, demotivated engineering department production, culture Was a sale job with outbound call dealing with nursing homes, allowing me to work with anything from medical equipment to beds. Work place was great loved the people I worked with hardest part was closing the big jobs employee owned closing big jobs Fun workplace, internship provided a lot of learning opportunities. Gained a lot of experience with Linux systems and development, gained more experience with C development. Very friendly culture. High expectations for interns. Tuition Reimbursement, Profit Sharing, 401K, free lunches, flexible schedule Below average compensation Changes and Management Except for the last few years, this company overall is a very nice work place. However recently changes in the company are not as good as it sounds like. Decent place to work Direct Supply is a decent company, the location isn't ideal and career advancement can be a struggle, and compensation is average. Productive, Great Atmosphere Such a great company to work for! There is a great group of people who manage and are partners. The company is always very great about keeping all partners in the loop on what is happening and what is about to happen within the company. I highly recommend working here! Great culture, free drinks and snacks, profit sharing Move up course to get where you want Family atmosphere while working for a great cause Direct Supply is a great company to work for. The people are amazing and they make you feel at home and very comfortable. Working to improve the Long Term Care Industry is a noble cause. Job security is very good, but job advancement is getting better. Fun work environment, the people, family atmosphere compensation and upward mobility Dog Friendly Workplace I was a contract employee there for 8 months. I felt that I was treated as a non-team member while I was there. It was nice that they worked with me on the hours I worked which were 7-330. They treat their permanent employees very well. Many free lunches and perks. You can bring your dog to work any time you like. The support , coaching and feedback that I needed was non-exsitant. Lots of free lunches & employee perks Not a place to learn & grow. Account management Great entry level sales position. You build a great network of colleagues, and the work environment is a lot of fun. The pay is low-to-mid market value, though great benefits. Good place to get experience then move on. The people you work with pay, career path Excellent company I loved working for Direct Supply. They company treats their employees well and I would still be there if I did not move to London Management, Employees, Work Events, Fun Environment Wet with Pets Nice people alcohol dependency culture however the pets in the work place add a calmness. Owner is outstanding and sales as well. Creative Easily irritated IT staff Productive and fun environment Long lasting relationships and great culture. Upbeat staff. Dogs are welcome within reason and many perks to working in office. Area not the safest but the security team is plenty visible. JOb culture Good only if you are a young white male If you are a young white male, this is the place for you...unlimited opportunity, a true voice in the company, etc. If you are a female or a person of color, you will be much happier somewhere else. They will tell you that you have a voice and that you are a partner, but that is not the day to day reality. You are paid below market as they tell you that you will be an owner. That is a great benefit...trust me, until you have to put down a second mortgage on your house to exercise shares. If you don't exercise shares, you are viewed as not committed and put on some blacklist. The biggest negative is that they tell you how to vote so if you aren't a hardcore republican, stay away. They even have yard signs for you to put on your lawn for the ""right"" candidates. When I started there I thought it was all about being free to be who you are, but at the end of the day, you are only free to be who you are if you are a young, white, male republican. Profit sharing, fitness center, relaxed dress code Tell you how to think; you must be under 40 to be taken seriously Health Care Sales Managed a territory of Underdeveloped accounts with a core market of Skilled Nursing Facilities. Accountable for Order Growth, Margin Growth, and Revenue Growth on a year to date scale. Ability to transition accounts that are deemed appropriate to transfer due to growth in orders and dollars per bed. Utilization critical thinking was key to be able to become creative and credible in the role. Benefits, 401K, Gym On Campus Salary below average Productive and Strong Work Environment with good Work/life Balance Goals are fair and company understands changes in the market may affect your numbers. Clear trajectory if you wish to stay in sales, and very strong management. 1 Outstanding culture, passionate partners, unlimited opportunity Outstanding culture, passionate partners, unlimited opportunity 3 4 Work Hard, Play Hard Organization that values their employees. Very entrepreneurial atmosphere that rewards creativity and drive. 4 1 Great place to work Great place to work. All about promoting from with in. Account manager role is a lot of up and downs. Big on numbers and hitting budget. On the phone all the time, pretty much cold calling and introducing yourself to people until you've built up your territory. Some customer can have a negative notion of you as AM's pervious might not of done a good job. Atonomy Can be stressful and at times exhausting trying to hit budget Serious but rewarding I handled a lot of confidential information for our students and faculty. I facilitated many mass mailings informing students and faculty about deadlines or about overdue payments. It was challenging because many students and faculty do not comply with your requests. It is rewarding because I learned a great deal about how to communicate in different ways to satisfy the people I was in contact with on a daily basis. demanding with a strong culture lots of last second demands and a great culture for growing ones professional skils. free soda and snacks, flexable time off and lots of it lots of preasure to preform and low saleries Great Culture but poor wages Workload was not challenging, just lots of it to do Co-workers were great they helped out a lot Communication Courses, Great internship experience Poor wages, mediocre management Direct Supply A good job for those who like to buy products from amazon, google, etc. A positive and challenging environment that focused on professional development It was challenging because we provided services ranging from buying monthly cleaning supplies to building a new facility. They treated their employees very well. They encouraged us to grow professionally by offering many classes for all partners. They wanted us to volunteer in the community and be mentors to the youth of Milwaukee. professional development and great benefits. hard for people outside of the uw system. Great Place for College Students Family environment.. Room to grow. Great for out of college Productive and Strong Work Environment with good Work/life Balance Goals are fair and company understands changes in the market may affect your numbers. Clear trajectory if you wish to stay in sales, and very strong management. 1 Great Company, terrible leadership. The good: Employee owned. You do receive stock and get a payout once a year. The pay was pretty good and the overall culture was very fun. Quarterly meetings with catered dinner. Free fitness center on campus. Beautiful campus. Every building has a kitchen with a fridge (or 2 ) stocked full of free beverages, a coffee machine (that makes fancy coffee) popcorn and pretzels. Dog friendly campus! The bad: location is horrible! Right in the middle of a rough neighborhood and right across from a trash site (got many nails and screws in my tires going to/from work. Leadership is very persnickety about “perception”. If you’re perceived as young and naive they will never take you seriously. Any complaint you may receive (could be about anything) HR will do an internal investigation. If you’re not very well liked at the company and they can’t get any “dirt” on you during the investigation they will still let you go and chalk it up as “integrity concerns”. Small but fun Great mission and culture. Too dependent on ceo and needs to diversify as he’s getting near retirement. Not as progressive as other tech companies.. None None Innovative Company with a Great Mission and Partnership Focused Culture Direct Supply is an amazing company to work for with a great work life balance. There is a ton of flexibility and focus on just getting your work done and not a lot of micromanagement. At Direct Supply, networking is encouraged and the ability to forge your own unique career path is available. Salary to start may be a little low depending on the role, but the opportunity for advancement, mentorship opportunties, and total compensation make up for that and much more. Direct Supply is an employee owned company with a great culture, long tenured employees and plenty of opportunity. They have a very entreprenueral culture that is focused on innovation and problem solving for their customers. The management team is great and has a focus on the future growth of the company and it's employees. Culture, Career Opportunities, Mission Driven, Work Life Balance, Innovative, Total Compensation, Stock Program Salary Culture is Key Direct Supply has a great culture! People who have been with the company for 20+ years are still as excited to work there as they were from day 1. There are several individuals willing to help you grow and be a mentor. Networking, Community Invovlement, Healthcare, Gym N/a Great culture and flexibility, lower average pay made up for in benefits. Overall this is a great company to work for, they care for their partners and make sure that everyone is fulfilled in their role and has areas to advance within the company. Overall the salary is lower than market average in many positions, but the benefits (401K, flexible work schedule, healthcare, casual dress code, perks, etc) help to offset this. The paid time off is also very generous even from day one. There's lots of opportunity to grow within the company, and you're able to take your career path and development in to your own hands. Direct Supply's culture is unmatched (and I have worked at other large organizations in the Greater Milwaukee area). They could improve at compensation and advancement for their highest performing partners. Benefits, culture, Pto, flexibility, autonomy, caring Compensation Focused on Professional Development My role at Direct Supply is unique. The Rotational Development Program is a two-year program consisting of four-month rotations across several lines of business. As an employee owned company, Direct Supply invests in its partners. Being a recent college graduate, the program has been a great fit in terms of professional development. employee owned, strong mission, professional development Employee-owned company that cares Direct Supply is an employee-owned company where employees really are treated like partners. This mentality originates from the Founder, CEO and President of Direct Supply, Bob Hillis. Bob leads by example. He genuinely cares about every partner and the senior living industry that we serve. The principles that Bob has set trickle down to every department within Direct Supply and have set the foundation for every aspect of my work. It is a huge motivator for me in sales. The caring culture carries through all levels within Direct Supply. Management has always been supportive and encouraging when it comes to career development. They make it clear that they want you to be truly happy and successful in your job at Direct Supply, whether that means developing and growing in your current role, or moving to other areas within the Business. Not only does Direct Supply care about me as an employee, but me as a person too. With things like the new Champion Wellness Center, options to work remote and taking tremendous steps to make sure our Campus is the safest it can be amidst COVID-19, they genuinely care about my well-being and safety. Employee owned, Champion Wellness Center--free for me and my spouse, free beverages, remote work options Great partner/owner culture, entrepreneurial leadership, important and easy-to-support business vision I work in IT on cross functional project teams and love the opportunity to work with a variety of smart partners on solving pertinent problems to our business. My expertise and critical thinking skills are challenged daily, and I enjoy the company vision behind it all. Employees are truly the biggest asset here, and a culture of partnership, coaching, learning and improvement are there for the taking. While work life balance is a struggle, it is because I enjoy the work I do. Comfort perks are great, too. leadership vision, ownership culture, benefits, campus, bring your dog to work, learning environment work life balance can easily be a struggle to achieve as there is a lot of opportunity Great company culture with opportunities for advancement I am a Senior Operations Specialist at Direct Supply, and a member of the Building Services Operations Team. I work with our customers and service providers to coordinate a wide variety of services at senior living communities. Since starting at Direct Supply, I have learned how important the work we do is to improving the standard of living for the seniors we serve. Over the last three years my responsibilities have continued to change as our business has grown, and as I was promoted from an Operations Specialist, to Operations Specialist II, to Senior Operations Specialist. I have enjoyed the employee ownership culture, collaborative work environment, and challenging opportunities that continue to push me. A day in the life a Direct Supply includes collaborating across many parts of the business, working with customers, interfacing with technology, and possibly even making it over to the Wellness Center (gym) or Joule Cafe. Direct Supply is a great company if you are looking for a place to call home and have a rewarding career. Culture, advancement, great campus, new technology, employee owned. Partners and Customers are a Priority! It is so rewarding to work for a company that is committed to taking care of their partners (Company is employee-owned so employees are considered partners). Each person is valued and apprciated for their contributions which inspires you to continue to work hard. That happens not only from leadership, but partner to partner. I can truly say that there is no other company that I've worked for that embodies 'delivering outrageous customer service' more than Direct Supply. Our mission and priority of taking care of Seniors is evident in every action we take. Caring for Partners and Customers, Work-life Balance, Partners are Appreciated and Valued, Visionary Leadership, Opportunities for Growth and Advancement Compensation lags behind other companies Exciting work environment with great opportunity for career growth If you are looking for a place to call your work home for the rest of your professional career, look no further. Direct Supply boasts strong employee retention numbers because of the unique company culture and the company leadership's overall desire to see you improve. This is not a work environment where you simply ""get through the day"" or slack off. Direct Supply upholds high standards for its partner employees because they are ultimately its stakeholders, and what determines the success of the business and its impact in the senior living industry. If you are also looking for a workplace with a sense of strong purpose and identity, Direct Supply is an excellent choice. Our core principles are engrained within our everyday tasks and the energy within my team, specifically, is unmatched. I would recommend Direct Supply as an employer for any hard-working, driven individual who is looking to progress in their career and ultimately contribute to a bigger picture. Lots of free food, games, grill outs, awesome fieldhouse/gym, and local food vendors onsite every week, also employee discounts at places like Costco and with other appliance companies Sometime struggles with work/life balance Excellent company to work for Remotely Enjoyed working with the guys in my team, strong communication is there and so is help, if you need it, Each day we did scrum and then off to my desk (at home) to complete my tasks. Stress Free environment They might let you go no matter how well you perform if you are a contract employee. Fun work Environment with a Unique Culture Direct Supply has a great culture where they emphasize a work/life balance. They also, allow for early growth within the ""career ladder"". With that said, you do get to a point where career progression comes to what feels like a ""standstill"". Also, the compensation packages appear to be a bit lower than the industry standard. Awesome People, Hard Work. This is a very demanding place to work. It is not easy work and requires much of the employee, however, the people are amazing. There is so much support within Direct Supply and they are very flexible with hours. I was really proud working with the people here and working for this company. Productive and fun workplace. Maximized efficiency of processes across the company as well as supporting all daily trading operations by performing analysis on business processes, writing work instructions, and working with executives on projects and initiatives. Fun Workplace, Good people The people at DS are some of the kindest, nicest people you'll ever meet. My direct manager was amazing and my dev lead was likewise FANTASTIC. The hard part (at least for me) was the pay--I worked hard and was there for 1.5 years while being a full-time student and never received a raise up from the base intern pay. All in all, if you get an offer here and want to work with fantastic people and enjoy a fun workplace, SAY YES! If you are in it only for the money, say no. Nice people The people who work here are really nice. They try their best to help you through problems in day to day work. Very collaborative. The campus is cool. DS takes care of their partners It was a great office with great people. I was happy to serve the other “partners”, as all employees are partners in the company. Many employee perks, like snacks, drinks, an hour for lunch, and you can rack up as much overtime as you want. I worked in the Campus Operations department. Awesome culture where the employees come first Just a wonderful place to work where everyone is friendly and willing to help each other out. Managers and executive level employees go out of there way to give opportunities to all employees Too Many Meetings I want to give a higher mark for work/life balance, but I can't. With all the meetings you are expected to attend it makes it VERY difficult to get any of your job done at work. The daily work doesn't stop when you are in meetings. Many nights multiple hours of work at home are required. Work load piles on with little help from bringing on new people. More and more work is handed out as hiring is at a snail's pace."
BECHT|" A great place to work! Work can be challenging at times, but not overwhelming. Employees are empowered to take ownership of their assignments and do so without hesitation. Nearly all of management comes from engineering backgrounds and understands the technical aspects of the work, but do not micromanage. Employees feel appreciated and turnover is very low. 1 Becht Cares! Working with Becht for the past 3 years and it has been an awesome experience working with the best in the industry. Benefits are great with excellent HSA plans and 401K match. Go-getters are awarded for their hard work! Lots of travel Make good money if you want no home life. Once you became a job lead you had no were else to move up. No benefits in any way. Getting time off had to be submitted a month ahead of time. Work wasn't terrible didfiy, but working in the elements made for hard long days. Company treats everyone like adults We were all left to focus on our work independently and there was no one sitting there holding our hands to do our work. There was opportunity to grow but it was always minimal. As good as work gets. Becht is a top tier company providing engineering and professional services to multiple industries around the world. As a post retirement job as an advisor you really couldn't ask for a better place to work if you are a self starter and like a challenge. You still have the option to set you work load and hours. Take on the jobs you want. It great. fully benefits, commitment, and support Provide fully benefits as vacation, 401K, insurances, training and other. The company is commitment with the employee welfare and the clients objectives. Excellent place to work with a team atmosphere. Becht has done a great job creating a cohesive team atmosphere in which individual team effort as well as individual skill is recognized and embraced. Skill development is at the fore front of concern for this employer. Small Company with Big Plans for the future! This is a small family owned business with big dreams and goals for the future. This company is intended to grow so much in the next few years and I am happy that I am onboard. Great core values that they live by Cannot think of any cons The company gives us liberty to operate on our experience with no interference. * I work 12-hours a day for 14-days straight but on the 2-weeks off I get quality time with the family. * We are constantly learning by getting more experience on different projects and getting familiar with new work management systems. * Our immediate management is great. They do all they can to aid us in any area we need. * We live in a camp, have many friends, it is like a second home. We have a gym and sauna's plus an opportunity to go fishing in the summer. * In the oil business, production and safety are key. With an old field like this there are frequent ""urgent"" requests which challenge us but our goal is to be ahead of the maintenance not reactive. * There is a great comradery most people get along well. This is needed because of the harsh conditions of the Arctic. Outside of our work hours we have no responsibilities at camp. It's a sacrifice to be away from home for 1/2 your life. A Great Place to Work What you'll find at Becht is the best of the best, you will be working side by side with some of the professionals who developed the codes, procedures, and standards used universally to this day. From day one you will be working on meaningful, relevant, and difficult projects that are sure to push your limits as an engineer. Every project I have completed has expanded my knowledge and skills, making me a better, more professional engineer. The management at Becht is not afraid to give young engineers the opportunity to show their stuff by working on increasingly complex and rewarding projects. I would absolutely recommend pursuing a career at Becht to all my friends and family. Great Company to Work For Becht Engineering is a great company to work for. Upper management really cares about their employees. It is constantly growing, so there is always room for more opportunities and challenges. While there is some room for improvement, overall it is a fantastic company to work for. Busy and fun work days There is always work to be done and the days are never dull. The work atmosphere is enjoyable due to great co-workers throughout all departments. Monthly pizza parties and bagel Wednesday! Flexible work environment and family-owned business atmosphere Working at Becht Engineering has been great. The hours are flexible as long as I complete my work. The other divisions within the company are ready, willing and able to assist when needed. I am impressed that there has not been in-fighting or silos develop as the company has grown. Flexible hours (within reason), Great managers, Everyone is invested in your success Healthcare plans not that great, work from home has its own set of negatives Fast Paced Family Owned Company There is a lot of opportunity to learn new things and a lot of willing people to help you. The company is family owned and very family friendly. The Division Manager wants you to succeed and pushes you to reach your full potential. There isn't anything that she wouldn't do to help you both professionally and personally. The work is very fast paced and you put your multi-tasking skills to good use every day. The hardest part of the job is working with different personalities that are located in different areas across the country. It also works both ways because you get to meet so many new and different people. Great place to work I am a new employee with Becht Engineering and I was already beyond thrilled to start working here since I was interviewed. This is a new industry field for me and with all the tools I've been given I am learning quickly and co-workers make it easy to ask for help when needed. The atmosphere in the office is relaxed and very personable. Very respectful and management is very approachable as well. Benefits are very good as well. Overall I feel very comfortable and will highly recommend working for Becht Engineering. Productive, team-oriented and respectable company. In my Project Manager role, I have observed that Becht Engineering is a highly respected and professional engineering consulting company, touching many disciplines of the refining, petrochemical and nuclear industrial space. Becht extends the highest quality bids for projects or not at all. This maintains their reputation and is an obvious part of the successful business model. Management is focused on growth and quality, and is as involved as they need to be, otherwise they let me do my job. The most enjoyable part of the job, and hardest, is efficiently managing their enormously talented group of technical advisers, who have seen all and done all there is to solve. The work is fulfilling, but flexible as well. Great Place to Work I have loved every experience at Becht so far. My responsibilities and time to do them in are reasonable and clear. Workplace culture is wonderful, everyone is accommodating and kind. I have huge faith in their management team, it makes a huge difference when you work for a company that make you excited to work hard for them. Great culture, great expertise The family feel, flexible schedule, and culture of excellence are just the start! Working with the best in the industry and learning from the true experts make every day a pleasure. Innovative programs such as new hire classes and leadership training allow you to develop and grow your career from day one. Professional Environment. Professional Growth. Great People I have been at Becht for over a year and it has simply been the best place I have ever worked. There is ample opportunity for growth and there is continuous learning opportunities. Management keeps the team engaged. Pay and Benefits are competitive. There are numerous social activities. The people are smart and easy to get along with. You do work hard, but I think they up to one of there core values which is work hard and have fun. You will be challenged, but you will not be abandoned. They are growing rapidly but I personally believe that they are sticking to their family business roots. Good Work Environment/Growing Company Comfortable work environment with opportunities to advance and learn due to the growth and structure of the company. Close-knit group that cares about the employees and culture. Good benefits along with flexible schedule and competitive pay Great company to work for, Growing with great vision in the industry Great company to work for. They have opportunities at times that require travel to some remote parts of the country. They offer very good benefit package along with a good pay rate for your assigned job role respectfully. A great place to work! Work can be challenging at times, but not overwhelming. Employees are empowered to take ownership of their assignments and do so without hesitation. Nearly all of management comes from engineering backgrounds and understands the technical aspects of the work, but do not micromanage. Employees feel appreciated and turnover is very low. 1 Good place to work A great place to work if you want to make a lot of money fast with little to no experience. If you enjoy traveling, this is the place for you. Overall a good work atmosphere. Good place to make money fast with little experience Unsteady schdeule Got to know someone there to get hired on it was ok money but no benefits and if you wasn't buddies with manager you wasn't gonna last long. pack around equipment weighing 50 pounds up and stairs and ladders 1 Good pay At some point they forgot to take care of their employees. Performance reviews can go more then a years past their due dates. Management makes up requirements as they go along. Coworkers are good people but management are so focused on the client that they don't care about the employee. 90% of complaints to management go un-checked and un-accounted for. If you are looking for a place to gain education this is the place but it is definitely not a place to make a career. Some employees are grandfathered into being bad at their job and never getting fired or reprimanded. This makes it extremely frustrating when you are trying to do good at your job and you see first hand that no one cares about employees who simply do horrible and cost the company thousands of dollars. Can't get fired Bad co-workers are rewarded for bad performance small company Becht Engineering is a sizeable firm in engineering field which is specialized in petroleum industry for refinery equipment retrofitting via advanced analysis. Productive and friendly work environment Great first work experience. Staff was very friendly in helpful. Provided me with knowledge and experience of what to expect in a work environment outside of college. Great Becht Engineering is a very good company, organized, fair, Client service oriented, people high skills, experienced and knowledgeable. Management is open mind and helpful. Fly by night company This company is really only a head hunter to place qualified persons for other companies. In my experience, Becht supplies almost no HR or advancement opportunities. The times I needed a Company Support person...I found there is no company or support. Good Pay almost no support, terrible health insurance Similar to other engineering companies. Learned in general how HVAC engineers work and what is expected of them. Learned administrative work that came with the engineering work. Most of the people in the office were engineers and rarely spoke. A very quiet workplace with work to be done at all times. My work was fairly simple and was finished as quickly as possible. Becht Engineering contracts annuitant specialist for Petroleum Industry Turnaround and Regular Maintenance needs throughout this country and overseas. This job requires you to travel and work away from home for Turnaround and Regular maintenance needs. Your boss is the company you are contracted with thru Becht Engineering. You have to adapt to each companies needs and management systems. Small company with a fun atmosphere I worked for this company in the Accounts Payable/Receivable department. The team I worked with was small, but all the ladies were great. My direct manager was very supportive and had my best interests in mind. The most enjoyable part about this company was the making our clients happy. The hardest part about this company, and this was 13 years ago, was the pay. I really cannot comment on the health insurance as I did not carry it through them. Free training courses low pay Very professional organization A total joy working with this company. They were extremely tentative to their employees. They tend to keep the employees best interest at hand at all times. Great Atmosphere and Pay/Compensation My experience at Becht Engineering was, overall, a positive one. They are fair in pay, provided multiple bonuses through out the year, and had a decent insurance plan (there is only one available), as well as great vacation, sick, and holiday time. All roles in the office I worked at (Baytown, TX) provided an above-average opportunity to learn and grow at your desired pace. Though mostly positive, there were a few cons. Procedures change daily in the role I held, and one person in particular is very difficult to work with, and works half way across the country. While this individual means well, they do not possess a personality type that is compatible with most people. You must have a thick-skin and welcome constructive criticism to work here. I did not have a problem with this, as I have always had perhaps too much of a backbone, however, once again - it may not be very compatible for most people. You MUST have self-discipline as well as the ability to work well on your own, and adapt quickly, as you will repeatedly been tossed in the water to learn how to swim on your own. Growth Opportunity, Work Independently, Remain Busy at a Fast Pace, Your Input is Appreciated, Work Recognized, Benefits/Salary/Other Compensation Some Personality Types in Upper Management, Constant Changes in Procedures, Lack of Guidance Becht Engineering Another Company working with Retires in coming back to work but work through Becht-Engineering.

Invoice Cloud| Many Changes Daily changes and a lack of work aids make this job a very frustrating and troublesome environment. good pay management, constant changes, lack of tools 2 One of the best companies I've worked for in 20 years Invoice Cloud is a high-growth company with ambitious goals, yet we have realistic expectations, supportive management, and a great product. I've worked at enough high-growth = high-churn companies to know that this isn't the norm. They've done a great job supporting us during covid, too. If you want to work for a fast growing company that's more consistent than a typical funded startup, definitely consider Invoice Cloud. Strong and supportive company culture, challenging and rewarding work, good benefits, and leadership is great. High-growth company - it isn't for everyone 1 Adversarial Management Adversarial distrustful management. Not a positive culture. The good is that all that guarantees the company squeezes all employees for the most output so plenty of profits for owners, so company will not close down. No breaks, barebones benefits, tense environment 1 Great Place to Work!!! This is a great place to work. I work in the Information Technology department and there is a lot of friendly and proactive work that occurs in the department. Other departments are very friendly and helpful. Outstanding Company I find this a great company to work for. I had to choose between 2 job offers and am so glad I took this one! Everyone is supportive and patient and willing to help with any additional training required to master your position. Executive management is encouraging and stops by to visit when in the office and remembers your name and history. Best place I've worked in years! Free Breakfast Friday monthly none Challenging work environment I did a 2 month project work. So, I don't know much about it. but I can say it is really challenging and can build a good career. My supervisor is really good to give me some insights and helped me to complete my project successfully. Management Dogs were treated better than employees... Always felt like you were on pins and needles to be the next one yelled at, even when you were brand new to the role and were just learning.

Relativity|" Customer Support Management is terrible I would not recommend working for Relativity. The management team is the worst I have worked for at any company. There is a massive learning curve that happens at this company that they have failed to fix in the entirety that I was there. Unfortunately, this has caused a massive exodus of techs over the last year with over 1/3 of the team finding new jobs.

I was working mostly on an internal tool, which was still a lot of fun, but I didn't learn as much as I wanted to learn. However, the people and management are great to work with, from what I've seen in my short time. Great office, unlimited discretionary PTO Didn't learn as much as I wanted to 1 The boys club.

If you are an experienced professional, be ready to face the triad of inexperienced senior management. Be ready to flatter and please, then you will be promoted. It doesn't matter if you have experience or not, be ready to please even more, especially in HR. They hire, fire, and promote as they want. Processes? Nope, never heard of it. Relativity is a good company, HR there is the weakest link. No competent person would ever join that team. Pass.

Nice amenities, friendly environment Lack of clarity in career advancement Very comfortable environment to work in. The environment was very comfortable to work in and the people are great to work with. There was one drawback. You needed to pass their Certification examination. The certification is based on the company's flagship application. I understand the reason to know the application, but I disagree that you need to pass the exam to continue employment with this company. The exam for most of the employees is not really needed to do the job they were hired for. If I knew how tough this exam was I would not have accepted this position. Excellent Benefits Passing their Certification Good company - terrible management The company is good. The people there are unbelievable to work with - extremely smart, humble and are always willing to help you out. The management on the other hand has no idea what it is doing. People are let go without any warning whatsoever even though management claims that warning was given to them. The management doesn't understand the product completely and never listens to the employees especially those of whom have be working on the product for a long time.

Intuit|" Flexible Flexible hours but the management and help sucked. They expected so much from us without the proper certifications. Not a sincere company, ripped their customers off. 1 Training AI to do the job My experience at Intuit is not that positive. We basically train AI to one day do our jobs. Intuit claims they foster an inclusive environment, but I haven't seen any of it. At least none on the ""expert"" or ""select time"" managers don't practice this. The amount of micromanagement is beyond acceptable. The pay isn't even comparable to similar positions in the same sector. Word of advice, just no...no need to thank me for the heads up. 2 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? the paycheck What is the most stressful part about working at the company? the manager What is the work environment and culture like at the company? its remote... 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? The flexible hours and the managers and leads are all so helpful What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Uncooperative customers What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Wonderful What is a typical day like for you at the company? Busy but joyous I love helping people 2 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Up-to-date technology. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Constantly revolving managers. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Used to be hip and cool, but now it's corporate b.s. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Pressure to produce more. Intuit is a great place to work! I was hired as a contract SDR here for a while and thought the culture at Intuit was great, they were always flexible with time off and sick days, great work life balance. Managers were also always supportive and friendly without being micromanagey. Not the same company Before I left, the culture and company didn't feel like the same company I originally joined and loved. There is no loyalty to it's employees that have given so many years of their lives to the company! Great pay and great manager. I enjoyed working here. The pay was good. My manger was helpful and experienced. I didn’t like the schedules as much. I was offered 2nd shift and I got off around 1 am. It was a fun place to work The guidance that you receive after coming out of training is very little. The recognition that you deserve from the surveys left is hard to come by. The wages were not good. Fun environment Benefits & wages Great company to work for! Intuit is a great company to work for with the opportunity to advance in your job. Intuit has all types of employment from preparing taxes to providing bookkeeping there's also Financial jobs to assist you with any and every aspect of your life and your finances. Into it is the greatest place to work for is one of the top Fortune 500 companies. I love working for this company it is amazing! Remote work, Fun environment Love, love, love, love, love working here. This place is the best company to work for. The training is the best, and you have so much support. The bonuses are great too. Great place to work Great pay, set your own hours, and great management. Intuit is always changing policies and procedures so you must be able to PIVOT accordingly. I would highly recommend! Amazing Place to Work! Intuit is an amazing place to work. I am grateful every day to work and such a positive and fun environment. Great culture, benefits, compensation and rewarding work. Great Job Flexible remote hours with a supportive company and co-workers. Plenty of opportunity to advance. Fast paced and exciting if you like taxes. Great 401K plan and good pay. Turbo tax side good QuickBooks not so much regret moving Do not transfer to the QB side turbo tax was an amazing experience awesome management and motivation. So encouraging. QB polar opposite and never ending policy change with no consideration for GAAP. Productive and motivating work environment Management is amazing when it comes to helping you achieve your goals. Not only do they care about their employees but they also strive to make you the best you can be. good In terms of what kind of qualifications they are looking for, I'm a CPA with public audit experience and a private controller with some basic tax knowledge. Is that a good fit for this gig if I ever wanted to look into it? Or are they looking for people with a tax background. 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Best part is working for a quality company - they are upfront and honest with employees regarding all aspects of the job and are more than fair with employee salaries and benefits (Salary and 401k)! What is the most stressful part about working at the company? At first, not knowing the questions you will receive from phone customers is stressful - (product or program or technical tax questions) - What is the work environment and culture like at the company? As a remote employee, during tax season, I work hard for Intuit (TurboTax) to accomplish all I can - I feel that all company employees feel the same way - they all work for a quality organization that supports them with a great work environment and great pay and benefits! What is a typical day like for you at the company? As a full service agent working remotely, I work on preparing, completing and filing individual tax returns that include Schedule C - 1040 (Profit or loss from business) Excellent Pay & Benefits, But… The work was challenging, and the compensation package was very competitive, but there were culture issues with employees & management transferring in from the corporate office in Mountain View, California. A lot of cliques and loyalties that were just based on familiarity rather than actual ability and accomplishment, to the point where it sometimes felt like being back in high school again. If you didn’t have a seat at “the cool kids table,” you were generally out of luck as far as opportunities for advancement and being taken seriously. The constant managerial restructuring was exhausting, too. I survived at least three rounds of large layoffs in a four-year period before my department was finally consolidated with Tucson and my position in Reno was eliminated. They offered me a lateral transfer to another department, which was technically a demotion, so I declined. I give them four stars strictly for the competitive pay & benefits, minus one star for the culture and management issues. Doing remote right Turbo Tax at Intuit has been remote from the get go so they have it down pat. Great team members, great enviroment and great pay. Raises are frequent and bonuses are generous. The only downside is the scheduling tool is a nightmare. They have all the resources to become independent This is an Awesome company to work for! They appreciate their staff and are always showing them that. Many opportunities for advancement. The management staff are something you don’t experience at every job. They are wonderful people and very well experienced. Frequent opportunities for different positions. I love this company and can hardly wait to return every season. This will be my 3rd tax season and there will be many more for me! Flexible schedule, many spotlights for work well done. The management team is Awesome! Long hours at peak season but that is to be expected at any tax preparation business and Flexible Flexible hours but the management and help sucked. They expected so much from us without the proper certifications. Not a sincere company, ripped their customers off. 1 Cool company to work for They care about their employees. They have weekly meetings and goals for you meet. They have a lot of continued education and very laid back. Their is room for advancement Great place Good work life balance. It has been great and I have worked there for 5 years. I wouldn’t trade it for anything else. Been working remote before the pandemic 1 It's a cult It's a customer service cult. All they care about is qwikboookz (misspelled on purpose). You'll get an annual review not even halfway through your 3rd quarter judging only based on the first two quarters; so if you're improving in 3rd and 4th it does not matter at all. Managers do less and less the higher up they go, they just get more into the cult vibe. They all worship the CEO in a creepy way. If you've ever had corporate / customer service type jobs, and there were some people who were just totally into the 'culture', and you thought those people were weird.... Well, they all end up at this place, and they love it. Good for them. If that fits you, this is your place. Otherwise, good luck. nice facility, decent benefits cult, cult, cult. Great place to work! Love working here. Only issue I have is performance is based on customer surveys, so even if customer loved you, if they were upset with something in regards to TurboTax, it still counts against the Tax Expert. Work from home, great benefits, Spotlights Penalized for customers frustration with program Excellent benefits but the customer support and tech stack are abysmal! Excellent benefits but the customer support and tech stack are abysmal! They state they are customer centric but a customer can never get good assistance after the sale. Professional and Fun Great place to establish a work at home flexible option to supplement income based on choosing your on schedule. Options are available for full time work as well. Professional organizations with appropriate training and implementation of new technologies and business procedures Great place to work! I enjoy starting work these days. I like what I am doing and I can take classes so I can better myself. The best place I have ever worked. The majority of the people are friendly and helpful. Very welcoming company to a new hire. Just starting. Zoom meetings have been a nice intrduction. Training will be in January. Free self-teaching tax courses are great for refreshing and learning new tax information. Equipment is supplied. Leaders are personable and want to be helpful. ? Don't know yet. Hyped work place The work environment and pay are reasonable but with a lot of hype it is seen as an extraordinary place to work which it is not. Relies heavily on surveys to improve the work environment. Feels too much like a big corporate structure that is run by lawyers. Good work life balance I was very proud to call Inuit my place of employment, until they forced the policy of COVID vaccine being required to work there. Decent pay, great work/life balance Great place to work and flexible schedule Always to for advancement , management is very helpful, they give bonuses and pay increases regularly. An pick up overtime . You are always learning Remote work for professionals They give you all the resources and tools to effectively work from home. You create your own schedule, so you can still enjoy life. The management is professional and there are so many opportunities to get free gift cards. Flexible schedule, stock program and 401k matching from the beginning Tons of changes throughout the tax season Great wfh job Very welcoming and supportive management. Clients usually very friendly. Pay was good. Got to pick your own hours,and start working with sick time available.Great work life balance Really Impressed Intuit has really exceeded my expectation on all levels. I have learned so many new skills while at Intuit and I have also really enjoyed my time there. Flexible schedule, real time support, competitive salary and benefits. Great place to work moms will love it Great place to work especially for working parents Easy to work from home They cater to families and it’s so nice to work for company that understands the need for flexibility yet offers great pay Great place remote jobs No e no the team leads are never around to assist you with your issues you are having, and the systems are constantly having tech problems. save your time, look somewhere else for 14 and hour that isnt worth the stress. Intuit cares about its employees, even the seasonal ones. Great place to work choose your own schedule. They provide all the tools and training that is needed to get the job done. We meet once per day for team meetings, there we can ask questions, express concerns and/or get updates from management. When I first started there every season I would be assigned a new manager and new team. This was kinda ok because it gave you a chance to meet new people. However, now when the seasonal staff returns we keep the same manager and same teammates. This worked out great because I have an amazing manager and an awesome team! Good training and support Intuit has this down to a science and can support you even when you're working remotely. They have invested in the technology to help you do your job, and the pay is fair. Great place to work Love working here, definitely would recommend working here. Great flexibility when it comes to work hours and ample time off is allotted. Great place to work It’s ok It’s a large corporation. I haven’t had an amazing experience. Most of the time you are being told you’re too slow. Be prepared to have every single minute of your day analyzed and turned into a statistic for the people at the top. Flexible Flexible hours but the management and help sucked. They expected so much from us without the proper certifications. Not a sincere company, ripped their customers off. 1 Not a supportive work environment Training was really bad, expect to just be thrown in unless you get lucky and actually have a good manager / supervisor. Everything is about productivity and the monitoring of your work. Most of the time I feel like I’m part of a social experiment for management and supervisors entertainment purposes. Also, there’s Nothing like being in a zoom meeting where supervisors/managers are obviously sending direct messages to one another and talking about your co workers or you and laughing at whatever private joke they have going on. I’m trying to give it some time to see if things will get better but literally this is what I have observed. During training we were told “if you don’t like technology this is not the place for you” 2 401k Match Flexible Schedule Great team atmosphere. I've had excellent managers each season. Opportunities for credential courses and cross-platform positions in bookkeeping with QuickBooks. Tax Work I live TurboTax as a product and Intuit as a company. The manager you get can make or break your experience. There are a lot of opportunities for professional development. Pay, benefits Managers vary. Training is not good The training is horrible. The pay could be more competitive. Overall the people I meet were nice. I'm not a fan of the video call it makes you look like you don't know what your doing if you are using sources. Productive and fun workplace Great team and management support. Plenty of goal incentives and good bonus. Get to set your own flexible schedules. Company provides laptop and other tools to work from home. Good place to work Very good and supportive management. Huge learning curve in the first year and help is always available when needed. I'd like to stress that everyone is always ready to help out and the company has vast resources of material to cross reference and to learn from. A new employee will learn very quickly and we deal with lots of different tax issues. Also, the training is great and the company offers materials to study for Enrolled agent and gives vouchers to pay for the exams. The company also offers free QuickBooks courses which when you pass you can get a full time position with Intuit. I find this company to be very employee friendly and one of the most supportive companies I have worked for. Good Good place to work flexible and offer chances of advancement. Really feel blessed to work for them. Great management and tech support. Enjoy coming back every year. Great place to work Everyone is positive and collaborative. Management could use a leadership course refresher. Lots of tenured people there which gives you the sense of security Excellent pay with Informative Training & Support It's taxes, so can be very busy especially during tax season. You have to be able to handle a high-stress environment and call volume. Most people aren't happy when calling customer service so skills like empathy, interpersonal, and emotion-regulation are crucial. This company isn't going anywhere and exceed other's by far. Excellent pay compared to other remote positions/companies None Productive and fun workplace and environment I really enjoyed the opportunity to work for such a great company. A company where everyone gets along and everyone gives a helping hand. Upper management is super nice. I really enjoy working for this company and it’s affiliates. I look forward to many many more years with Intuit. Intuit is a awesome company and family to be apart of. Stressful and intense work load Intuit is not so great as a company as a whole being that they contract out customer service to other companies making the experience as a representative worse since they can make you work till you break Remote work, Flexible Hours, Plenty of resourses Worked as a seasonal employee during tax seasons and from the technology, to the resources available to succeed where great. Support was only a click away from on call managers who could answer questions quickly to resolve client issues. Pay was good and plenty of incentives offered to keep you motivated and engaged. Resources, Access to Managers for assistance, Pay/Incentives Sometimes very long days, but it's to be expected during tax season - not really a con but some people may not like that. Great place to work Started with fairly low pay as a CPA but after 8 months pay was ok and benefits excellent. Flexible work schedule with fast paced training. Must have technology skills Wonderful I had a great experience can not wait till job begins again in the fall..highly recommended. Great people.great experience. Great pay.works around family life Amazing company with the potential to be great Supportive company with an amazing flexibility. It is very difficult to have anything other than a seasonal tax position as they do not offer many full time positions in this area. The lack of loyalty in that area is the main downfall. You can work your tail off putting in all the hours when you’re needed but they don’t hesitate to lay off. The pay is average but they do have a good 401 matching program. The company culture is one of the best and for the most part, managers genuinely care about their employees. Ability to work remote, flexible schedule Very few year round openings Good pay and benefits Compensation was fair, unlike a lot of other companies. Management was awesome. Easily accessible, but they left you alone to do your job. Training was kind of confusing, but it was paid at your regular pay rate. Surprisingly, there was paid time off, even for seasonal employees. Also, bonuses and incentives were given regularly. All equipment was provided for remote position. Overall, a very good company to work for. Fun work environment The people there are fun and are willing to help if you need it. I enjoyed meeting other team members because they made coming on a team call more exciting and it build team unity Not dependable, unfair pay The highest people in their department they call them A5s, hosted and star trained I decided not to do that because they can’t go any higher in the department and literally get as much pay as someone who just walked through the door, it’s unfair how they pay their employees you can never come into work and have a good day because nothing works all the time, the programs are broken everyday.. it will be weeks before 1 investigation will have a solution and it’s just a workaround for the moment. They aren’t dependable at all I loved this company I always received great feedback from managers. They foster a team environment with an emphasis on education and advancement. I really enjoyed my time there and would recommend this company to anyone. Love my job Supervisor appreciates me. They have rocked the remote space and work hard to have an inclusive environment. No egos. One team. I really enjoy my position. Flexible Flexible hours but the management and help sucked. They expected so much from us without the proper certifications. Not a sincere company, ripped their customers off. 1 Remote work, diverse and interesting team, great people I didn't know much about taxes and took a seasonal role that I didn't think I'd like. Turns out I was wrong - the product is great, the support system is great, the people are great. I feel lucky to work here, I've been promoted twice and am now a full year employee at TurboTax. I love it and I'm still learning new things every day. The best part is the people. great seasonal position I like that you can choose your own schedule. You will enjoy this job if like learning about taxes. Can be hectic once tax season starts but you can work as many hours if there are not enough people. 1 Pretty cool job with lots of perks I think it's pretty cool that if you read things like this like your supposed too that some time just maybe sometimes you'll catch some one writing a trap. You can't believe that this actually that a word trap. I got in that you can't handle that my words has you trapped like a magnet it can't stops end like that no way then I say kay as I listen to my rap. No way. Awesome people Flexible schedule and great teams to work with. The company offers benefits to part-time employees and match plus for 401K. It is a remote assignment so you can work from home. They provide all equipment needed you just have to provide the internet. Great seasonal job Love helping the customers and working from home. Scheduling leaves little time for home life but it’s only 4 months out of the year. Management is also seasonal so there are some HR challenges. Good pay, opportunities to advance, lots of hours Lots of hours, scheduling tool is inflexible Great people to work with I'm currently on a contract, so the stress of possibly not being able to stay may make my review biased. Management cares about me reaching my goals, there is room for me to grow as an employee. 3 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Work from home What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Fast paced Best place I have ever worked The pay you very well and offer you the opportunity of contributing to a 401k and Intuit stock. They offer great additional incentives for performance and work ethic. The pay you like they appreciate your expertise, and work. None Great team environment I enjoyed working with my team. I felt well trained and I did not feel lost in my job task and duties. I love the fact that there was no micromanagement. Tax Expert I am able to choose my schedule for the upcoming month. It is easy to make changes and I enjoy the flexibility. My manager is easy to talk to however the communication is not regular. Sometimes I wonder how I'm doing outside of surveys. Sykes/sitel for intuit just say no! Found this job to be demanding and difficult to learn there are so.many programs to learn and so much information to retain it got frustrating most of the time the trainer was rude and played favorites they didn't give enough time to learn all that was needed to learn to do the job correctly then in the midst of training they announce they had enough agents for the tax season so we all had to reapply for other jobs within the company and get accepted if we wanted to remain in their employ which made no sense to struggle to learn the intuit info only to work under that client for the three days of 4/15, 16, 17 . Then have to move elsewhere in the company . When I expressed my frustration over the training and limited time under intuit they said I voluntarily resigned and marked me not eligible for rehire so the 2weeks I invested in them was a waste the pay is good the benefits were good just the overall onboarding and nesting was lacking . Would not recommend. Everyone fr the owner care about each other I love working for Intuit! This will be my third yr in Nov. managers and leads are patient and compassionate about the company therefore they are the same with their team! Always there if you get stuck! 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Such a great company to work for with amazing benefits. I was a seasonal employee during tax season but I was still able to compete for various incentives and other perks. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Tax Season Hours. Great place to work! I enjoy working for Intuit. They provide the perfect work life balance and above competitive pay. The fast paced work from home environment is great and you still get plenty of opportunity to interact with your teammates and manager. Customers usually dissatisfied with some things This job was okay and flexible but we usually get customers that get angry at free filing and doing their own tax by contacting product support instead of a tax advisor seems of to me.. Turbo tax amazing QuickBooks side not so much Can not say enough good about the turbo tax management and job. Made the mistake of going to the QB side where the training is lacking as is managements ability to motivate or encourage. Half of the experts do not understand accounting or know what GAAP even stands for but these are the ones they will encourage. Weird how different the two sides were Great 401k wonderful incentives on turbo tax side QB needs to take notes from TT maybe question the QB turnover rate and why so many clients leave QB High intensity Love the job. Very supportive environment. Always someone ready to assist. Great learning material. Promotes growth and promotion from within. I love love Intuit Culture pay Seasonal Excellent benefits Hard to complain about a position that is fully remote and allows a good work/life balance. However, competition for job openings is fierce so advancing your career is nearly impossible. Good Remote Job Decent pay for a starting role. Managers were responsive, and you're not constantly hounded about stats... But you are reminded every week. The bad are customer surveys. Personally, I feel this is an unfair and uncontrollable metric. If you happen to get angry customers, or people who don't get what they want (even if you follow company policy), you're metrics will suffer and you'll have a hard time promoting. Flexibility Surveys Best job I’ve ever had!!! Great people, environment & pay. They truly care about your progress as an employee. Having a great team of management and coworker support is the best part of the job. Flexible Flexible hours but the management and help sucked. They expected so much from us without the proper certifications. Not a sincere company, ripped their customers off. 1 Amazing company to work for! Very flexible and you will always receive praise from all management levels, even the CEO sends out short videos and emails to even the entry level employees thanking them for their hard work and perseverance through the tax season! Everything! Intuit worked as hard for me as I did for them Intuit, Inc. Overall is a wonderful company to work for. I was fortunate to be on a team on the Quickbooks side that was innovative and a test team for projects that other teams only adopted after we tested possible new project workflows. My supervisors were always supportive if I had questions about my clients. My manager took a personal interest in my life other than work, and she really supported me through some accommodations with HR. My direct report and my team members are great. Senior level managers need to take a long hard look at their demands on us. I do my job, I do it well, and the constant requirements of checking-in seems rather petty. Depending on your role, the evaluation and goal setting process is rather extreme for part-timers. Excellent remote work culture Training is very comprehensive. They have an excellent remote work environment and give you all of the tools needed to do your job to the fullest. I actually feel like I communicated with my coworkers and supervisors more in this remote position than I have in on-site settings. Overall an excellent opportunity. I only left because I was hospitalized with COVID for an extended period of time and wasn't able to maintain contact with them. Excellent training, tools, communication with team members workload got overwhelming quickly Intuit is a great place to work. I really like it here. Flexibility with scheduling and excellent 401k plan. The downside is there are no full time positions for a tax expert. I've met and exceeded my goals every season since I have been here. The positivity/sharing is promoted from top!!! ..No pitfalls from management but there to help u give the best!! A big Thank you!!! A huge positive motivation!!! Flexible schedule. Real team work/sharing and positive motivation environment. INCLUSIVE!!! Energizing Great Team Work As a Tax Prep Assistant it was my responsibility to gather the information from the client and assign to a Tax Preparer. I loved engaging with the client and ensuring that the package I put together for the Preparer was complete Love working at Intuit I feel empowered and love to help people. Intuit is the perfect place for flexibility, career growth and connections. I feel valued and respected working at Intuit. Productive and fun-working environment My manager was amazing!! Everyone was helpful but some of the leads were condescending when they were giving advice. The customers were easy to talk to. Very enjoyable work environment I really love taxes and Intuit is a perfect environment for doing what I love. Intuit allows you to use what you know and teaches you what you need to know. I wish it was year around and I hope they invite me back. Intuit allows you to improve with help getting Enrolled Agent Credential . Tax Academy which raises your knowledge because truly taxes are constantly changing. Flexible hours, nice pay. I cannot think of one con good and bad Love Intuit love working for them, enjoy the job, management, training - all . Negatives - only seasonal employment without benefits. I understand there is not a need for full year round employment, however I would stay with them forever if they offered health benefits and if you always knew that you were coming back and would be hired for the next season. great work atmosphere seasonal Training short but efficient, staff sometimes helpful, but mostly up to you. Thru training can achieve most goals that need accomplished. Mostly this is a self fulfilling position. Learn as you go. And take care of customers needs. Work at home. This is the best benefit. Short breaks company does not consider the home fixing method. Great company The best company I've worked for. They try to treat employees well with the benefits and time-off structure. My only complaints are the pay is lower than I'd like and the health insurance is different (and not as good) in customer-facing positions. Productive,family life ,suppotive,advancement opportunities! Employees are great appreciated. Work and life balance works great here! Always have support when struggling. 401k matching program. Employee education available for advancement and experience Good place and team to work with Tax season can be hectic and stressful but at Intuit they make sure not only are you supported but have fun too. I love that I can work remotely and set my own hours. You receive ongoing training so you are always prepared for all the different situations thrown at you. Tax Expert I love this job. Im in my second year . This job has changed my life honestly. The hours can get hectic soo its what you make it. Good luck. Im seasonal so no healthcare.. but i have 401k Bonus flex hours No healthcare Fun place with great people! Tax season can be hectic and stressful but at Intuit they make sure not only are you supported but have fun too. I love that I can work remotely and set my own hours. You receive ongoing training so you are always prepared for all the different situations thrown at you. Opportunities for advance; incentives, bonus, 401k with a great match…the list goes on and on. I love Intuit! Culture changing Good place to get feet wet with tech culture. However Intuit comps are on the low end, and there was a toxic management culture were leadership surrounded themselves with ""yes men"". Anyone who wants to go against the grain should have enough political capital to do so. Great Team Environment I enjoy working for intuit. Even though I am a seasonal employee they offer great benefits and opportunities to grow within the company. I would definitely recommend working here. Great place to work I like the company overall. It's a business that makes you feel like family. I learn on a daily basis. Teamwork is essential and Intuit has it. I will retire here"
Resource Data|" Great people, fun projects, mediocre benefits I've been with Resource Data for a long time, and I love most things about the company. As a consulting firm, they do contract work and custom software development. Company culture is laid back yet professional, and I've always felt supported by management. If I'm not enjoying a project or have trouble working with a client, which honestly rarely happens, I feel like there are always options to move around or find other interesting work. My main complaint, and I've heard this from other coworkers as well, has always been the mediocre health insurance options. The company is constantly switching from one insurer to another, trying to find a better option, but still premiums keep rising and the company seems to do nothing to help out with the costs. Premiums are unpredictable from one year to the next, and even the high deductible plan is extremely costly. To their credit, HR seems to put a lot of work into trying to do the best they can, even hiring consultants to handle benefit management, but at the end of the day, rising costs are always passed on to the employees. Flexible work schedule, technically interesting projects, friendly and knowledgeable staff Healthcare Opportunity and learning This is a good employer for individuals who want some autonomy on how they get their work done while still working within a team and continuous opportunities to learn. Because the work is based on client needs, what you do will change, sometimes many times a year, but as an employee of Resource Data, you have stability while the client base changes. This is a great opportunity to work in many different environments or to focus on a single major domain such as oil & gas or state government, depending on your desires. Fantastic company I thoroughly enjoyed my time working at Resource Data. Great group of people that are forward thinking and very intelligent. I learned so much while I was there and had opportunities to work with technology I never would have been exposed to. Great people, good salary/benefits, very collaborative, management looked after you. Can’t think of any. I had a new opportunity that better fit my future goals, but would’ve loved to stay. The Work-Life-Flexibility is where its at! Resource Data is a great place to work. RDI doesn't only provide an environment that is committed to paying you your worth for the time you put in; they also help you build skills, and allow you the flexibility to live your life at the same time! It's wonderful! I makes me feel valued as a person, and makes me feel like I am an asset as an employee. Resource Data Perspectives As a business analyst my typical workdays vary depending on the nature or phase of the project(s) I am working on. At times I have worked solely on one project for one client for a while, and at other times divide my time between projects, often for different clients. Management hires good people and expects them to have a good work ethic. They are relatively hands-off but provide regular updates on company developments, and invite constructive feedback. Resource Data has an excellent staff of bright, talented people in a range of roles pertaining to information technology. This makes it a great place to leverage expertise from different perspectives and skill sets when problem-solving for specific client projects. I appreciate Resource Data's long-term presence in Alaska, having over time developed ""footprints"" with branches in other parts of the country. I also respect their long and continuing list of contributions to public, private, and government enterprises across a wide spectrum of industries. I was drawn to their desire to support work-life balance for their staff; they are accommodating of varying scheduling needs depending on one's stage of life. In my relatively brief time at Resource Data, highlights of learning experiences include assisting with aspects of a merger/acquisition, assisting in a readiness assessment for a federal security standards audit, and collaboration with a team of analysts on a large corporate IT transformation effort. The best people The people at Resource Data are amazing. They are the most intelligent, trustworthy, and hard-working group of people I have ever worked with. The company's commitment to work-life balance seems to attract very good people who, together, create high-performing teams. A solid team with opportunities to grow. Resource Data has variety of clients, so day to day work can be varied. This can allow employees to develop their skills across a spectrum of tasks and projects. At the same time, if you don't prefer a position that varies so much so often, this can be a bit of an obstacle to overcome. Given that there are such a diverse sets of tasks, you often get the ability to step into a new role to gain experience on a new technology while being surrounded and supported by experts within that field. Ultimately the best part of working for Resource Data is that you are given ample opportunities to learn and grow. If that is what you are looking for, then it would be a great fit! Resource Data is a great employer Resource Data is a great employer with tremendous opportunity to work on some exciting projects. the culture here is wonderful. I highly recommend taking a look. Resource Data Culture The one story I tell to illustrate the Resource Data culture is as follows: The first assignment I had at RDI was work to modify how employees went about requesting time off. The current system had the employee put in their request and then the system would send an email to their branch manager to approve the request. The thing was, there was no option in the email to deny the request, only a button to approve it. The enhancement I worked on was to eliminate the email altogether, the philosophy being that, since RDI trusted their employees to be professionals, there was no need to have a PTO approval request at all. That is the thing I think I like most about the culture at Resource Data. Basically, if your clients are happy, there aren't any further questions. What are you waiting for? Resource Data, Inc. has been an excellent place to work and has provided me opportunities to improve my skills and grow as a programmer. They have provided everything needed to successfully work from home during the pandemic and offered many forms of support. I would highly recommend you consider applying at Resource Data. They are seeking a unique type of programmer, so years of experience may not be enough to get in the door. Being a self starter is important and a desire to learn is key. You will have the opportunity to be hands on with many technologies and experiences. If you struggle with change and having variance in your work day, you may struggle here. If you enjoy variety and learning new thing, you will thrive at Resource Data. Flexible and Supportive Workplace Work culture is flexible and provides opportunity to learn, with management strongly supporting people as individuals. Needs are accounted for and other employees are very supportive. Excellent company! RDI has been so supportive of its workers during the Covid crisis. The company has absolutely proven that they not only say the right things about work-life balance, but they follow those words up with actions. My work is challenging, interesting, and varied. When I've encountered obstacles -- typically because a task was outside my skill set -- there are always people to turn to for feedback and direction. I highly recommend RDI as an employer. Great opportunities available if you make the most of them I've been with Resource Data for 7.5 years and have moved from GIS Programmer to Senior GIS Programmer to Technical Lead. My typical day starts with checking emails and messages that I received since I left the office/signed off from the day before. It is important to me that I work at a place that does not require me to be responsive to communications outside of work hours so that I can maintain the work life balance I desire. There are times to be responsive outside of normal hours, and occasionally it can be helpful especially around launches of new applications, but it is not required. I've learned a ton about full stack web development for multiple stacks (e.g., .NET Framework, .NET Core, Django, Node.js, Java), Windows applications (WPF), Continuous Integration/Delivery strategies and implementation, architecture and database design, technical writing and documentation, as well as soft skills for leading and managing teams and communicating with clients. The management here greatly depends on the managers you work with. Some come from technical backgrounds and can be very hands on and involved. Others come from more business analyst backgrounds and rely on the Tech Leads or lead developer on the team to keep the development and implementation on track and to communicate status updates to the PM. I've enjoyed working with most of them. A key aspect to the company is that they do not hire for a project, but rather hire the person for the hard and soft skills they have. What this means is that if a new hire starts on a project and sees it through to completion Great people and interesting projects... There is no typical day, that is what I like the most, a variety of clients, projects and technologies. As long as you communicate your goals and interests the team will do its best to match what you want to do with clients and projects. No company is perfect, some clients are difficult, but if you enjoy variety, want to work with great people and value integrity and work/life balance then this is a great place to work. Great place to work I am very happy working at Resource Data (RDI). I feel appreciated, respected, part of the team. One of things I enjoy about my job is that I’m always learning and growing as a developer. I have worked for a wide variety of clients on a wide variety of systems and I’ve never felt pigeon-holed to a certain type of work. My shortest client engagement was three months and my longest was over three years with the average around two years. My fellow employees are usually intelligent, enthusiastic, hard-working, and fun. Managers discuss assignments before committing me to a client, and my input is taken seriously. Working remotely at RDI was common long before COVID, but there have been times when I was on-site at a client. Resource Data hired me after a long break in my work history. They started me out at a lower salary level and advanced me rapidly with each review. Great Place to Work This company provides varied project types with working and learning opportunities. There is a lot of opportunity for growth. A good work/life balance is something that management strives to provide for their employees. Great place to work! Resource Data offers diverse work for employees in both client business areas and with varying technologies. Management is very supportive and helpful with employee career tracks, and the company really values work-life balance. The employees are smart, helpful, and easy to work with. Employees are expected to work both independently and as part of a team, without being micro-managed. Excellence and Pragmatism Resource data is a large team of highly capable, pragmatic and accountable engineers and analysts. The work I do and the people I encounter here have helped me to hone my skills. The management team is engaged, technically competent and show genuine care for their employees. The administrative staff and Proposals team keep our work streamlined and incoming. I am fortunate to work here! General Review Resource Data is a modern company with good business practices that emphasize work-life balance. I have never had any issues with leave, being overworked, or having any issues with any coworkers. It is a very solid choice of place to work. Variety of work and room to learn During my time with Resource Data, I've been able to learn web development using several different technologies while on the job. There is often a variety of work to keep things interesting with the many clients we work with. With that variety, it can prove a challenge to learn on the go, but there are plenty teaching resources and co-workers willing to help. Work life balance is a focus of Resource Data, so I've never had trouble finding time outside of work. r+ Resource Data is a great place to work. I'm surrounded by great and intelligent people who have a shared mutual respect for each other. I feel lucky to have found this place. Great people, fun projects, mediocre benefits I've been with Resource Data for a long time, and I love most things about the company. As a consulting firm, they do contract work and custom software development. Company culture is laid back yet professional, and I've always felt supported by management. If I'm not enjoying a project or have trouble working with a client, which honestly rarely happens, I feel like there are always options to move around or find other interesting work. My main complaint, and I've heard this from other coworkers as well, has always been the mediocre health insurance options. The company is constantly switching from one insurer to another, trying to find a better option, but still premiums keep rising and the company seems to do nothing to help out with the costs. Premiums are unpredictable from one year to the next, and even the high deductible plan is extremely costly. To their credit, HR seems to put a lot of work into trying to do the best they can, even hiring consultants to handle benefit management, but at the end of the day, rising costs are always passed on to the employees. Flexible work schedule, technically interesting projects, friendly and knowledgeable staff Healthcare Work Life Balance Achieved Amazing work life balance, which is not just something they say, but something that is true - the parking lot is nearly empty at 5:10 every night. Good work, good people, good product. Continues to be a great place to work I've been at Resource Data for several years now. The company is intelligently run, stable, and maintains an excellent work-life balance. I enjoy the opportunity to work for a wide variety of clients on different projects, which keeps the job from getting stale. There is also plenty of opportunity to advance skills and responsibility. It's important to understand what consulting is and isn't, because there are fundamental realities about the work that Resource Data has to contend with, but if those work for you, it's a great place to land. RDI is a nice place to work RDI has a laid back atmosphere that fosters a self starter attitude and offers excellent mobility within the company. The folks I've worked with at RDI are respectful and courteous yet direct and know what needs to get done to finish the job. We are very knowledgable in our respective fields and have a wide array of skillsets so it's easy to ask for guidance on topics you may not be as knowledgable about. It can be difficult to continue running to standstill with the wide array of skills that RDI sells to clients as a service but the best part about that is that there's always new technology to learn and ways of accomplishing tasks. Resource Data and its people are top-notch The key to success at Resource Data is to be a self-starter. Nobody sets your priorities for you and you have to bring your A-game to the table everyday. Your clients expect you to be an expert. You have to think critically, make decisions, and communicate, communicate, communicate. If you're at a client site, your RDI managers and team leads might not even know what you do on a daily basis and if you want help, you have to say something. If you've ever had a job where you could get away with saying, ""I dunno"" with a shrug, this ain't that kind of place. I am terrified every single day that I don't know enough to work here. BUT... The flipside is that if you love learning new things, if you can push yourself to the edge of your comfort zone with the aim of getting better, and if you want to strengthen your mental fortitude and confidence in what you can do, Resource Data encourages all of that all the time. If you don't know something and you want to, tell them - they'll put you on the right path. If you aren't feeling an assignment or a client and they have the ability to do anything about it, they will. If you screw up - well, yeah, you have to make it right, but they'll help you do it and learn how not to do it again in a way that doesn't make you feel so dumb about it. The hardest part of this job are those periods where one project ends and others have not started yet. You go from bringing in money to costing money. That's stressful because there's not always anything you can do directly to fix it. Resource Data also expects everyone, regardless of their role, to Great workplace culture, management, and co-workers Resource Data is an amazing place to work and they strongly encourage a healthy work/life balance. The management and senior staff are very in-tune with the employees and they try to establish a feeling of community and personal growth, even during these globally difficult times. They truly do care about individuals on a professional and personal level and will work with you to achieve your goals. Good consulting company As a consulting company, the work is varied and there are a lot of interesting and cool projects going on. The company is managed well and people are treated fairly. Best Company I have worked for in 35+ years of working Resource Data (RDI) is a great place to work. The work is mentally stimulating and engaging, you get great support from management and fellow employees. RDI provides the best work/life balance of any job I have ever had. RDI - A great place to work! A typical day at RDI is often filled with varying tasks that range from meeting with clients to heads-down development. The nice thing about RDI's structure is, as a developer, I can be assigned to multiple projects at one time. The benefit is that I am not always doing the same kind of work. I can be developing an API and a mobile application at the same time for two different clients. The environment isn't what I would consider fast-paced, instead methodical and considerate. Management is awesome at RDI. They are always willing to listen and do not micro-manage, which I find to be the best thing about my job. I have the freedom to do my job without being under a microscope for everything I do. If I make a mistake, I am informed but in a constructive manner and never confrontationally. The office atmosphere is also a big plus. It is a quiet place where you can focus on your work without distraction. If you find you need something to do your job better, they will provide it. I obtained my master's degree and thanks to RDI, they reimbursed well over 75% of the cost. Continuing education is important to RDI and they will help you succeed. Thee absolute best part of my job is the work-life balance. I am a father of three and sometimes there are needs at home that prevent me from making it to the office. I can simply send an email to my manager and work from home. No questions asked. If I have a family emergency, I can leave without any repercussion. The main thing to RDI is family first, however there is an expectation that your work will still be completed. Good place to work Resource Data is a great place to work. They highly emphasize work / life balance. Most of my work has consisted of things I haven't seen before (which is a huge plus for me). If I am having issues I have plenty of people I can talk to to get advice. If I am not liking a project then it is very likely I can get moved to another one. They just need to find a replacement for me and get the client's okay and then I can swap over. The amount of paid holidays is the bare minimum but I get plenty of paid time off to compensate. Great long-term job with flexibility and work life balance As a consulting firm, Resource Data is primarily focused on assembling talented and cohesive teams to collaborate on client projects. Projects vary in scope and size, requiring anywhere from a single developer to sometimes a dozen or more. With an organizational structure that is pretty flat, employees are afforded a fair amount of autonomy and responsibility, which works great for self-motivated individuals. The job is flexible and the company really prides itself in encouraging and facilitating a healthy work-life balance. One of the hardest parts of the job is balancing workload between multiple clients, as demand can be a little unpredictable at times, but Resource Data has great management that is willing to listen and work with staff to address issues and eliminate stress. One of the best parts of the job is the opportunity for exposure to different industries, subject areas, and technologies. Some clients expect staff to work on-site, and on long-term projects it can start to feel like you are a member of the client's staff, but the company does provide opportunities for staff to get together, both during and outside of work, for socializing and team building. A great company with great people Resource Data is a great place to work. The company's motto says it all: People - Technology - Results. The fact that ""people"" is the first word listed is no surprise. Everyone here is great - really smart, hardworking, and personable (a rare combination in the tech world). Management is very supportive of giving their employees opportunities to grow and truly care about us as individuals rather than as an expendable resource. In conclusion, Resource Data is great and my only regret is that I didn't apply to work here earlier in my career. Rdi Overall a solid company to work for with a wide variety of project work, and associated opportunities for challenge and growth. Managers can be completely hands-off, which I prefer but you can feel cut-off at times. Career progression is decidedly slow, although pay and pay increases are generally fair. Good work/life balance and work variety Resource Data actually cares about keeping their employees happy. The work/life balance is very good, as are the career opportunities. Although consulting is not for everyone, I enjoy the variety of projects, industries and technologies I've been able to experience. I am always learning and (mostly) not bored. The best 3 years of my career! I have been with Resource Data for just over 3 years. The best 3 years of my career! Until I found Resource Data I had never worked for a company that ACTUALLY cared about its employees. Sure, companies say they care, but from my experience that has always just lip service. Resource Data truly cares about their employees and will do whatever they can to make sure you are happy and stress free. The work life balance is great. Taking time off is encouraged, not looked down upon like at other companies. The hardest part of the job is getting used to the consultant work cycle. Moving from client to client took some getting used to at first. Great, fair, employee-focused company Resource Data has been a great company to work for. They are employee owned and it shows. Employee happiness is a clear priority. I'd happily recommend them to anyone in the industry. 5-Stars (out of 5) for Resource Data! I am a long-term employee with Resource Data, and plan to continue being even longer! This is an excellent place to work. Why? Flexibility, Self-Approved Vacation Time, Expansive Intranet and a way to recommend and be involved in improvements, State-of-the-Art Equipment to do your job, very Smart Co-workers, Supportive Environment, and the Company has high ethics. Resource Data expects the best, but they also provide the best environment to do your job. I enjoy my time working at Resource Data. Great place to work! Resource Data is a great place to work, with very capable and positive people to work with. I've recommended it to everyone I've met who are looking for work in the technology field. You've Got This As companies go RDI is overall a good place to work. By default, the overseers here tend to leave you free to find your own groove, or they are willing to help with your development if you ask them. Also, one's role in the company (e.g., BA, Dev, PM) is not fixed on day one. This is good if you're the kind of IT employee who enjoys doing different stuff. Co-workers are generally friendly, helpful, and supportive, with some exceptions, but you'll find impediments anywhere you work. You're most likely to succeed here if you like working on different projects over time. If, otoh, you're a one project for the long-haul type, this may not be the place for you. Hardest part of the job = best part of the job = freedom to learn new competencies. Open, inclusive, and honest company Resource Data is a very inclusive and honest company. I feel valued as an employee and that the company is invested in my success and growth. I am able to have open and honest conversations with management and staff about my goals and they are great at providing advice on what I can do to achieve them. Tech Group with Country Club Management Style I am working remotely 100% for an offsite client. Resdat is very lenient on how you work for the clients. As long as the client is happy, Resdat is happy. The client directs your activities and RDI does everything to help you, help the client. RDI management style is like Country Club Management. Everyone knows their place and the work gets done according to plan. When there is a need to regroup and find a solution to a new problem, everyone comes to the table and a new plan is created. No drama I have learned that our group contains highly technical people with a overwhelming drive to do the best they can for our clients. We have good people. Our clients know this and our company has been successful in maintaining long term working relationships with our clients. Great people, fun projects, mediocre benefits I've been with Resource Data for a long time, and I love most things about the company. As a consulting firm, they do contract work and custom software development. Company culture is laid back yet professional, and I've always felt supported by management. If I'm not enjoying a project or have trouble working with a client, which honestly rarely happens, I feel like there are always options to move around or find other interesting work. My main complaint, and I've heard this from other coworkers as well, has always been the mediocre health insurance options. The company is constantly switching from one insurer to another, trying to find a better option, but still premiums keep rising and the company seems to do nothing to help out with the costs. Premiums are unpredictable from one year to the next, and even the high deductible plan is extremely costly. To their credit, HR seems to put a lot of work into trying to do the best they can, even hiring consultants to handle benefit management, but at the end of the day, rising costs are always passed on to the employees. Flexible work schedule, technically interesting projects, friendly and knowledgeable staff Healthcare Work / Life balance and a working culture that encourages employees to do their best. Resource Data is a great company to work for because it treats people right and is committed to a work / life balance. The employees are a capable, diverse group of individuals; driven by success and personal improvement in a working culture that encourages employees to do their best. A company where individuals can share their ideas and grow in unique ways. Early on, the company turned to a work-from-home platform and it has created new opportunities for individuals to explore and grow, bringing new energy to the company. Interesting Projects I like the fact that I have multiple projects with a variety or areas and focus. The diversity of projects is one of the reasons I came to Resource Data and it will be a reason to stay. People are nice to work with and helpful. Great company to work for This is the best company I ever worked for. You get to participate in various projects, so there is always something new to learn, expand your horizons, and improve the skill set you have. The work/life balance policy really helps to lead a healthy lifestyle and be successful at work at the same time. I always feel my manager's support and enjoy working with colleagues. Terrific company! Exceptional company. Great people with terrific work ethics. Lean overhead allows us to bid on varied work projects that keep us all very busy. I find the diversity of projects keep me motivated; always something to work on. Exciting and Challenging Resource Data is a great place to work! I've been here a little under 10 years and appreciate the variety of clients and work.. When I find a great fit I can dive in and really immerse myself in the problem, but nothing gets boring or stagnant and I get a change of pace right as I need it. My coworkers are a mix of local and remote people across the western united states which is fun and means there's always someone on to help if I get stuck or need to talk through a problem. Excellent company that cares Resource Data is an excellent company to work for. Their policies are structured in such a way as to give you a lot of freedom and autonomy for when and how the work gets done. This means you get treated as an adult who knows how to best get your own work done! They do their best to listen to employees and implement suggestions that they have. Great flexibilty and work/life balance As a senior level developer, my typical day at work starts with checking my email and responding to anything high priority, then maybe a daily standup with my project team, depending on what project(s) I am on at the time. Once I’ve figured out my priorities for the day, it's time to get to actual work (usually programming and/or software configuration). Take an hour for lunch around noon. Attend the occasional meeting and respond to client emails periodically throughout the day. At the end of the day, complete my time sheet with anything I haven't already recorded during the day. As a software developer and an IT consultant, I learn new things every day, whether it’s in regards to a new programming language / technology or how a client operates or how to deal with a clients’ needs/issues. As a more senior level employee, management is fairly hands off with me and mostly lets me do my own thing. That works for me since I am a pretty self motivated person and I have been working in IT consulting long enough to know how to find work on my own. That said, management is always there to help out when needed. That has been my experience at least - your mileage may vary depending on the branch/client/project you are working for. The workplace is fairly relaxed and easy going. Though typical work hours are from 8:00 - 5:00, you can work with your manager to set a different schedule if you’d like, as long as it is within reason. You even have the option to work hourly and flex-up/down your hours as it suits you or take leave without pay when needed if you have exhausted your Great place to work I relish the work/life balance Resource Data provides. I also appreciate the culture of professionalism and trust that pervades the entire organization. A culture of opportunity Resource Data is a company of opportunities. Day in, day out, you have the authority and autonomy to do what's right and help the customer. Nobody is holding your hand or making every decision, but if you need help, it's there. Work hard when you are at work, do what you want when you aren't and the sky is the limit. The people are awesome, the work is interesting, and they live their values. Great for self-motivated, creative thinkers The best parts are consistently being able to learn new things, work on new projects, and build new skills. The company really does encourage employees to disconnect during off-work hours and has been very flexible for whatever each person's personal life choices may be (family/travel/both/etc). Co-workers are consistently great, and direct supervisors are not micro-managers. The worst part is that the financial compensation is bare-bones (6 paid holidays per year, 3 weeks combined sick/annual leave for first 3 years, mediocre wages). So, it depends on what you value and need from an employer whether it will be a good fit for you. Great place to work Overall, there is a good work/life balance. A lot of businesses say this, but it is real here. Interesting work, and lots of learning opportunities. If you like a variety of work over time, and want to be self directed, it is the place to work. Analyst/Programmer I was hired on at Resource Data Inc. as a entry level programmer analyst and have received nothing but support for continued growth and development during my year here. There is a company wide emphasis on work life balance. The result of company policies like these and others is that you're surrounded by bright people who enjoy the work they do. Resource Data - A Great Place to Start a Career Resource Data is an ideal place to begin a career. I began here right out of college and have remained with the company to this day. I have been given the necessary room to grow, figure out which aspects of my work I enjoy, and develop my career in the way that I'd like to. There are a variety of clients that I have worked for while with Resource Data, and every single one has had interesting work. Resource Data allows for flexible hours, but sometimes the clients are not as flexible. Resource Data stresses hiring the right people, even if they don't have a client in mind at the time. There is work available if there are no active clients willing to expand their teams. If you are working for a client and that contract ends, Resource Data works with you to either find another client that you have an interest in working for or they will put you on some internal projects. The culture at Resource Data is very welcoming. When I was hired, I had lunch with my branch manager and my HR Director. They both helped me get acclimated to working at Resource Data were sincerely interested in what I was interested in. Resource Data is also big on continuous improvement and training sessions. If you enjoying learning while you work, this is the place for you. Twenty Years In I have been with Resource Data twenty plus years. There has not been a week where I have not found my work to be challenging and interesting. I have been encouraged and able to apply my technical strengths to real world problems as well given opportunity to improve on my weaknesses. This is a great environment for a lifelong learner. I have been able to pursue interests to the left and right of the job description for which I was heired. I have been able to contribute to both large and small projects with teams as small as two to as large as twenty five. I have always felt supported by my peers, senior colleagues, and corporate staff. The general workplace environment is comfortable and calm. I fully expect Resource Data to be the last place I ever work. Long-Time Employee Management is honest and caring; co-workers are helpful and intelligent; hours are flexible as long as you make your meetings and show productivity, atmosphere is akin to a community. This is a great place to work While working here you will be exposed to a large number of projects from diverse business sectors, all with varying technical needs. You will be working with employees who are professional, treat everyone with respect, and actively practice work life balance. The best part of working here is the diversity of project work and the interesting problems that need to be solved. Proud of the compassionate company culture I cannot think of a company with a better organizational structure, or one that allows as much freedom and flexibility as Resource Data does. The employee-owned business model should be much more popular than it is, and Resource Data has the best example of such a model I've seen anywhere. Additionally, the people really do care about each other. The degree to which the managers care about employees is something I never imagined I would find anywhere. Very Happy with Resource Data When I was hired at Resource Data more than five years ago, I wasn't sure if I'd be a great fit or how long I'd stay. However, the years quickly flew by and I love my team, the support of corporate staff, and the company's values (i.e., integrity, financial stability, work-life balance, partnership, pragmatism, and responsibility). I can't imagine leaving. Resource Data has always allowed employees to maintain a flexible schedule and work remotely as long as you are accountable and get your tasks done. Corporate and branch managers pursue project work that is desirable for employees and strategic for the company's long-term stability and growth. Management and HR are always transparent and provide excellent updates to changes in our benefits packages, COVID policies, and internal business processes. I can't recommend Resource Data enough. Flexibility and diverse work assignments Resource Data Inc has been ahead of the curve in accommodating what modern day professionals need in an employer. Providing a work life balance, challenging work, and the ability for staff to grow have been part of the culture since day one. Aside from this qualities, I enjoy the diversity of work assignments. I also feel secure in the company because they have a diveser portfolio of clients across many industries so we don't suffer when certain industries are experiencing economic lows. The people make it great! At Resource Data I get to work on a variety of different projects, while serving differing roles which keeps me on my toes and the job interesting. Couple that with brilliant peers and smart management, its become one of the best jobs of my career in the IT industry. Great people, fun projects, mediocre benefits I've been with Resource Data for a long time, and I love most things about the company. As a consulting firm, they do contract work and custom software development. Company culture is laid back yet professional, and I've always felt supported by management. If I'm not enjoying a project or have trouble working with a client, which honestly rarely happens, I feel like there are always options to move around or find other interesting work. My main complaint, and I've heard this from other coworkers as well, has always been the mediocre health insurance options. The company is constantly switching from one insurer to another, trying to find a better option, but still premiums keep rising and the company seems to do nothing to help out with the costs. Premiums are unpredictable from one year to the next, and even the high deductible plan is extremely costly. To their credit, HR seems to put a lot of work into trying to do the best they can, even hiring consultants to handle benefit management, but at the end of the day, rising costs are always passed on to the employees. Flexible work schedule, technically interesting projects, friendly and knowledgeable staff Healthcare One Year with RDI What I like: + No micromanagement + Supportive coworkers and managers + Flexible schedule + People really listen to you and take immediate actions + The work is fun + Excellent mentorship + Great project management Things that can be improved: + The salary is lower than average Work day at RDI Typical day consist of developing custom solutions during software development process, occasional meetings, research as required. I have learned about enterprise software application development. Management is fair and supportive of personal and professional goals. Work culture emphasizes a work life balance and encourages growth. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with evolving technology. The best part is working with skilled professionals that are willing to help. Very positive experience Resource Data is a caring employer with lots of interesting work. They have a strong work-life ethic and numerous career paths that have allowed me to advance my career while still pursuing personal interests outside of work. Work\Life Balance The Company ""walks the talk"" when it comes to managing your work\life balance. It may not be in the top 5% in terms of typical benefits and salary; but it definitely treats you like a professional and gives you freedom to work and play. That is a huge advantage over other places I've worked. Challenging and Supportive Be prepared to grow and adopt a learning mindset. You will develop a broad and flexible skill set that you can adapt to a wide range of clients. You receive a lot of support in moving up the career tracks, but the job titles are less segregated than you might assume (especially between the Project Manager and Business Analyst tracks). If you ask for guidance, direction, and mentorship, you will receive it. Expectations are high, but so are the supports. Must like change and working alone They care about the employees, and offer flexibility and tools to make it easy to work anywhere/anytime. However, advanced experience is required, even though they say differently. There is no official training and you are often expected to work alone with little support. You must be able to figure things out on your own. Work/Life Balance is a key priority, able to work remotely Requires being able to work independently in constantly changing environments with little support. Great Company to Work for In my experience RDI is the only company I have worked for who actually cares about their employees, treats them like actual adults who can get their work done without being micromanaged, and who gives employees the flexibility they need to do so. Remote work options are allowed and do not require special arrangements (unless a specific client requires it). It's a great place. Great company to work for. Very top notch company. Many opportunities very diverse technologically. Great management and owners. Great benefits , health plans. Incentive plans and more. Productive and quiet place to work Management is good but project management lacks at times. Most enjoyable part of the job is the flexibility with your work schedule. Living in a large city with heavy traffic, being able to come in and leave early is a benefit. Free lunch every month Good company; do your homework I'm the HR Director for Resource Data and so that should be taken into account; I've been with the company for over 15 of the last 18 years, electing to come back after a 3 year break. For employees, we focus on being a great place to work where you're treated like a professional. We value a work-life balance and flexibility, but our biggest strengths is that the work is interesting and your teammates are smart. Some other employer review sites have larger numbers of reviews and probably do a better job of providing a balanced picture of the company. Every company has strengths and things to improve. We are always doing that and want candidates to get a good idea of the type of company we are so that when they come, it is a good fit and they have a long, successful, and rewarding career here. Work-life balance, flexibility, teammates Resource Data Inc The Juneau branch of Resource Data Inc is always hiring programmers and now I know why. When I was first hired through an entirely telephone based interview process I jumped at the opportunity to move to Alaska. By the time I had arrived in Juneau the branch manager who hired me had stepped down. The companies on boarding process for new programmers consisted of giving me a poorly written and outdated technical manual and throwing me head first into code maintenance of the companies Intranet. After two months the Sr. programmer I sat next was moved offsite and I continued development with almost no oversight. The junior programmers I work with are all very nice and easy to get along with but share similar experiences of being overwhelmed and under trained. Six months in and I am still waiting to to be put on a real project and wondering why I was hired in the first place as there seems to be no work for junior programmers and I am left wondering if there will be any in the foreseeable future. Management seems focused on drumming up new business, all of which is contract based. In the time I have worked here I keep hearing about the next great contract that is sure to bring us lucrative work. But very few of those contracts ever seem to come to fruition. The flexible hours have been nice as has the opportunity to be exposed to a variety of web technologies, however as a new Software Engineer I see little room for career growth here. If you are a seasoned professional familiar with dealing with the inns and outs of contract based software development looking to settle down Flexible Hours, Exposure to a variety of technologies Petty job culture, Lack of projects for junior programmers, Poor over-site of new hires Smart employees A good small-ish sized company that hasn't lost touch. Pleasant coworkers and management that still value their employees. It's contract work, though, so it's all about the billable hours. Free sodas when I was there. There was talk about taking that away though Benefits aren't great Great people, fun projects, mediocre benefits I've been with Resource Data for a long time, and I love most things about the company. As a consulting firm, they do contract work and custom software development. Company culture is laid back yet professional, and I've always felt supported by management. If I'm not enjoying a project or have trouble working with a client, which honestly rarely happens, I feel like there are always options to move around or find other interesting work. My main complaint, and I've heard this from other coworkers as well, has always been the mediocre health insurance options. The company is constantly switching from one insurer to another, trying to find a better option, but still premiums keep rising and the company seems to do nothing to help out with the costs. Premiums are unpredictable from one year to the next, and even the high deductible plan is extremely costly. To their credit, HR seems to put a lot of work into trying to do the best they can, even hiring consultants to handle benefit management, but at the end of the day, rising costs are always passed on to the employees. Flexible work schedule, technically interesting projects, friendly and knowledgeable staff Healthcare Opportunity and learning This is a good employer for individuals who want some autonomy on how they get their work done while still working within a team and continuous opportunities to learn. Because the work is based on client needs, what you do will change, sometimes many times a year, but as an employee of Resource Data, you have stability while the client base changes. This is a great opportunity to work in many different environments or to focus on a single major domain such as oil & gas or state government, depending on your desires. Fantastic company I thoroughly enjoyed my time working at Resource Data. Great group of people that are forward thinking and very intelligent. I learned so much while I was there and had opportunities to work with technology I never would have been exposed to. Great people, good salary/benefits, very collaborative, management looked after you. Can’t think of any. I had a new opportunity that better fit my future goals, but would’ve loved to stay. The Work-Life-Flexibility is where its at! Resource Data is a great place to work. RDI doesn't only provide an environment that is committed to paying you your worth for the time you put in; they also help you build skills, and allow you the flexibility to live your life at the same time! It's wonderful! I makes me feel valued as a person, and makes me feel like I am an asset as an employee. Resource Data Perspectives As a business analyst my typical workdays vary depending on the nature or phase of the project(s) I am working on. At times I have worked solely on one project for one client for a while, and at other times divide my time between projects, often for different clients. Management hires good people and expects them to have a good work ethic. They are relatively hands-off but provide regular updates on company developments, and invite constructive feedback. Resource Data has an excellent staff of bright, talented people in a range of roles pertaining to information technology. This makes it a great place to leverage expertise from different perspectives and skill sets when problem-solving for specific client projects. I appreciate Resource Data's long-term presence in Alaska, having over time developed ""footprints"" with branches in other parts of the country. I also respect their long and continuing list of contributions to public, private, and government enterprises across a wide spectrum of industries. I was drawn to their desire to support work-life balance for their staff; they are accommodating of varying scheduling needs depending on one's stage of life. In my relatively brief time at Resource Data, highlights of learning experiences include assisting with aspects of a merger/acquisition, assisting in a readiness assessment for a federal security standards audit, and collaboration with a team of analysts on a large corporate IT transformation effort. The best people The people at Resource Data are amazing. They are the most intelligent, trustworthy, and hard-working group of people I have ever worked with. The company's commitment to work-life balance seems to attract very good people who, together, create high-performing teams. A solid team with opportunities to grow. Resource Data has variety of clients, so day to day work can be varied. This can allow employees to develop their skills across a spectrum of tasks and projects. At the same time, if you don't prefer a position that varies so much so often, this can be a bit of an obstacle to overcome. Given that there are such a diverse sets of tasks, you often get the ability to step into a new role to gain experience on a new technology while being surrounded and supported by experts within that field. Ultimately the best part of working for Resource Data is that you are given ample opportunities to learn and grow. If that is what you are looking for, then it would be a great fit! Resource Data is a great employer Resource Data is a great employer with tremendous opportunity to work on some exciting projects. the culture here is wonderful. I highly recommend taking a look. Resource Data Culture The one story I tell to illustrate the Resource Data culture is as follows: The first assignment I had at RDI was work to modify how employees went about requesting time off. The current system had the employee put in their request and then the system would send an email to their branch manager to approve the request. The thing was, there was no option in the email to deny the request, only a button to approve it. The enhancement I worked on was to eliminate the email altogether, the philosophy being that, since RDI trusted their employees to be professionals, there was no need to have a PTO approval request at all. That is the thing I think I like most about the culture at Resource Data. Basically, if your clients are happy, there aren't any further questions. What are you waiting for? Resource Data, Inc. has been an excellent place to work and has provided me opportunities to improve my skills and grow as a programmer. They have provided everything needed to successfully work from home during the pandemic and offered many forms of support. I would highly recommend you consider applying at Resource Data. They are seeking a unique type of programmer, so years of experience may not be enough to get in the door. Being a self starter is important and a desire to learn is key. You will have the opportunity to be hands on with many technologies and experiences. If you struggle with change and having variance in your work day, you may struggle here. If you enjoy variety and learning new thing, you will thrive at Resource Data. Flexible and Supportive Workplace Work culture is flexible and provides opportunity to learn, with management strongly supporting people as individuals. Needs are accounted for and other employees are very supportive. Excellent company! RDI has been so supportive of its workers during the Covid crisis. The company has absolutely proven that they not only say the right things about work-life balance, but they follow those words up with actions. My work is challenging, interesting, and varied. When I've encountered obstacles -- typically because a task was outside my skill set -- there are always people to turn to for feedback and direction. I highly recommend RDI as an employer. Great opportunities available if you make the most of them I've been with Resource Data for 7.5 years and have moved from GIS Programmer to Senior GIS Programmer to Technical Lead. My typical day starts with checking emails and messages that I received since I left the office/signed off from the day before. It is important to me that I work at a place that does not require me to be responsive to communications outside of work hours so that I can maintain the work life balance I desire. There are times to be responsive outside of normal hours, and occasionally it can be helpful especially around launches of new applications, but it is not required. I've learned a ton about full stack web development for multiple stacks (e.g., .NET Framework, .NET Core, Django, Node.js, Java), Windows applications (WPF), Continuous Integration/Delivery strategies and implementation, architecture and database design, technical writing and documentation, as well as soft skills for leading and managing teams and communicating with clients. The management here greatly depends on the managers you work with. Some come from technical backgrounds and can be very hands on and involved. Others come from more business analyst backgrounds and rely on the Tech Leads or lead developer on the team to keep the development and implementation on track and to communicate status updates to the PM. I've enjoyed working with most of them. A key aspect to the company is that they do not hire for a project, but rather hire the person for the hard and soft skills they have. What this means is that if a new hire starts on a project and sees it through to completion Great people and interesting projects... There is no typical day, that is what I like the most, a variety of clients, projects and technologies. As long as you communicate your goals and interests the team will do its best to match what you want to do with clients and projects. No company is perfect, some clients are difficult, but if you enjoy variety, want to work with great people and value integrity and work/life balance then this is a great place to work. Great place to work I am very happy working at Resource Data (RDI). I feel appreciated, respected, part of the team. One of things I enjoy about my job is that I’m always learning and growing as a developer. I have worked for a wide variety of clients on a wide variety of systems and I’ve never felt pigeon-holed to a certain type of work. My shortest client engagement was three months and my longest was over three years with the average around two years. My fellow employees are usually intelligent, enthusiastic, hard-working, and fun. Managers discuss assignments before committing me to a client, and my input is taken seriously. Working remotely at RDI was common long before COVID, but there have been times when I was on-site at a client. Resource Data hired me after a long break in my work history. They started me out at a lower salary level and advanced me rapidly with each review. Great Place to Work This company provides varied project types with working and learning opportunities. There is a lot of opportunity for growth. A good work/life balance is something that management strives to provide for their employees. Great place to work! Resource Data offers diverse work for employees in both client business areas and with varying technologies. Management is very supportive and helpful with employee career tracks, and the company really values work-life balance. The employees are smart, helpful, and easy to work with. Employees are expected to work both independently and as part of a team, without being micro-managed. Excellence and Pragmatism Resource data is a large team of highly capable, pragmatic and accountable engineers and analysts. The work I do and the people I encounter here have helped me to hone my skills. The management team is engaged, technically competent and show genuine care for their employees. The administrative staff and Proposals team keep our work streamlined and incoming. I am fortunate to work here! General Review Resource Data is a modern company with good business practices that emphasize work-life balance. I have never had any issues with leave, being overworked, or having any issues with any coworkers. It is a very solid choice of place to work. Variety of work and room to learn During my time with Resource Data, I've been able to learn web development using several different technologies while on the job. There is often a variety of work to keep things interesting with the many clients we work with. With that variety, it can prove a challenge to learn on the go, but there are plenty teaching resources and co-workers willing to help. Work life balance is a focus of Resource Data, so I've never had trouble finding time outside of work. r+ Resource Data is a great place to work. I'm surrounded by great and intelligent people who have a shared mutual respect for each other. I feel lucky to have found this place."
General Dynamics Mission Systems, Inc|" I feel well cared for working for GDMS. The nature of my work is fulfilling, and I plan to stay for many years. Working for GDMS can best be described as flexible, challenging (in a good way), constructive, and fair. The company provides constant outlets to resolve issues, and higher management very much looks after the well being of their employees. 1 3 Thank you for your review and your loyalty. We are entirely committed to making General Dynamics Mission Systems a great place to work and we appreciate your recognition of our continued efforts. Thanks for being a part of it! No structure or leadership There is insufficient training for production workers and little or no grooming employees internally for technical or supervisor positions. You can’t hire techs and supervisors off the street and expect them to contribute if they haven’t had hands on experience and training. Hours Morale is terrible Productive and Busy Workplace This company has high advancement opportunities for engineering. If you seek to learn and grow, you will be challenged. Those who show drive and integrity are fought over between program teams and end up getting assigned far more work than is feasible. Technical management is aware of the issue and make a very strong effort to do nothing about it. If you are not an engineer, prepare to be laid off during the next unforeseen economic downturn. The engineering work is not very technical or research intensive. There’s a lot of process and paperwork. For Software, 10 percent of your time is touching code. The rest is dealing with process. Compensation packages are on the admirable side initially, but don’t grow as fast as other companies in the area. 2 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Rarely let go anyone working directly on gov contracts What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Over micromanagement What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Comply or be replaced. Not encouraging for long term employment hence a very high turn over rate. Flexible Working Options The work/life balance is mostly good, and they are loose about their hybrid/work-from-home model, so I rarely go into the office. The only downside is that I am not completely interested in the projects, but that is just because of the industry, not the specific company. 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? People you work with What is the most stressful part about working at the company? The preach ‘work-life balance’ but don’t live it. People are stressed What is the work environment and culture like at the company? People just wait for their turn to get laid off Great Stepping Stone I've had a good experience. They need to hire more people and find better ways of retaining the competent workers. I've seen a lot of people leave because they found better opportunities with this companies competitors. Management makes decisions without fully understanding situations There were times when the job would be very frustrating because management did not fully understand the issues. They would not take the time to hear all facets of a situation or they did not care. They had a preconceived solution which may or may not fit and could do further harm. It's a job. Pretty good co-workers. Management is another story. A lot of favoritism and but you get every other Friday off, if not on overtime. Would be a lot better with better management. Might just be my department, but everyone was very helpful and willing to help others learn their role. I would enter the office at around 8 AM every day and leave at 4-6, depending on the project. Much of the company is kept under wraps, so I cannot elaborate on the details of the different programs, but they were really cool. The hardest part about getting started was the sheer amount of information that you need to process; it's like drinking from a firehose, but the people in the company are always willing to help you learn the job. Some will even teach you about their own areas of expertise if you are interested. Hours are very flexible, There is plenty of job mobility, Earned PTO, Plenty of company events, Free to work at your own pace for the most part, Cool programs, Plenty of different positions to move to in order to find the position for you, Matching 401k, Great healthcare coverage. You are a government contractor, so you will deal with the government regularly. The company is extremely serious about time charging, there have been several firings for mischarging time. The support provided by teammates and leadership is fantastic. We work hard and the results are very rewarding. Management is excellent and the 9/80 schedule is awesome allowing every other Friday off. There are always new work and learning opportunities available. Schedule and team comradery. No shaded parking for those working on site. Management in it for themselves Interviews are a two way street. I interviewed for a position, took the job, and on my first day they had reorganized the department and placed people management roles who should not have been. I always made sure my boss didn't look bad when he made a call I didn't agree with, but when a situation escalated due to his call, he never owned up to it and it made me look bad. When I said I needed help, I was essentially told to standby and see how things worked out. I stopped caring and found opportunities elsewhere. Pto You have to fit into what they consider ""normal"" Overall laidback atmosphere compensation and overall appreciation for employees is not there. Lack of respect from upper management. Only way to make a living is to work 7 days a week. Advancement is based of who you know not qualifications. No employee engagement what so ever because of the area people are treat as if they aren’t human. Typical US Business behavior GDMS is a huge company, and as its a company its beholden to its shareholders. The C-Suite act like any other major company and only try to hit their bonuses and make record profits and everything else be damned. Government Defense Contractors arnt going anywhere TONS of middle management Purposeful workplace with many opportunities Most enjoyable part of my job is that I get to support an IP-based communications system used by the US Coast Guard to protect the border and conduct search and rescue missions. Professional company I was employed for less than 2 years and spent 7 months working from home due to covid. Great people to work with. I wasn't able to find a position I felt really good about due to the short stay. I was not happy with job location in Massachusetts. I left to go back out west and into a field service job, Good pay and work schedule None Great pay and benefits, poor leadership from director level on down The department I worked in was always about the ""good ol boys"". if you weren't one, you weren't advancing. Period. But past that, the company itself is great, very good benefits and pay. Pay, benefits, job purpose Poor middle management and good ol boy system Overall great place to work The culture was very laid back. We had core hours from 9am-1pm where the bosses expected us to be there, but other than that, you could come in go as you pleased. As long as you had 80 hrs at the end of two weeks, the managers did not care how you got it (At least from the teams I saw). We had every other Friday off, and the Friday on was casual Fridays. The enivornment in Pittsfield was almost like a family type feel because there were several employees that had been there for over 15-20+ years. The job security is great. I only left the company because I hated the weather up there and I'm from South Carolina. I wanted to move back home. I love the fact that what I am doing is to help to support those that support my country. I am doing my part to keep them safe as they keep us safe. I have learned more than I can tell because at General Dynamics Mission Systems, it's all about security. We will ensure that our company is secure an in the process ensure that our country is secure. We get the job done right. The work is based on quality more than quantity and I have always wanted to work for a company who understood that quality meant better & survival. Great, if you like slow-paced environments with no upward mobility! GDMS is a revolving door of interns and recently graduated students who quickly leave once they realize they're getting shafted. The pay and compensation is abysmal, therefore they can't retain talented people. There's zero room for growth as tenured people refuse to leave and let the less experience take over. There aren't any clear delineated paths to advancement. The work is uninteresting and slow, so you're days will drag. That being said, the people there really make the job. It's really a really family-orientated environment so if you have kids, are a spouse, or what have you, GDMS definitely works around that. They pressure you to take time off if management knows. My management has never less than supportive. Good pay but boring work Good pay but boring work. Often times did not have enough work to fill my day with. Felt like it was a hurry up and wait mentality, but we had to charge our time to projects anyways. I feel well cared for working for GDMS. The nature of my work is fulfilling, and I plan to stay for many years. Working for GDMS can best be described as flexible, challenging (in a good way), constructive, and fair. The company provides constant outlets to resolve issues, and higher management very much looks after the well being of their employees. 1 3 Thank you for your review and your loyalty. We are entirely committed to making General Dynamics Mission Systems a great place to work and we appreciate your recognition of our continued efforts. Thanks for being a part of it! The position provided the ability to improve the system of health care for employees and myself improvement as a manager My work at GDC4S started with a manager that under-supplied my post with materiel supplies. I worked within a stringent budget to maintain even basic medical supplies and office equipment that were freely supplied to my cohorts at the business unit headquarters. Despite these setbacks, I managed, through my own resources, the availability to establish and provide a medical care network to a populace that had gone without previously. After nearly five years and within ninety (90) days of becoming vested for retirement, I was given the option of either moving my family 2300 miles away, at my partial expense, or to undergo a layoff. Due to family needs, I took the layoff. I ultimately discovered that I was the lowest compensated individual in our team, despite being one of the highest qualified and most productive. It was necessary to retrieve the unpaid portion of my Flexible Spending Account (FSA) through an out of court settlement. Overall a great place to start your career, but doesn't give enough to stay Overall a has a good work/life balance, but what you learn in the projects you work on will probably not be helpful at all down the road. Pay can start out good (especially for new grads), but ends up falling into the same no raise trap many other companies fall into. 2 Thank you for your feedback. Paying competitive salaries – not to mention offering competitive benefits – is critical for any organization. Rest assured, we are listening and annually review our compensation and benefits compared to everyone – not just in our industry but in every industry. We are committed to making sure our people are compensated for being the very best… because that’s what they are. If you have specific ideas, please contact us at TalentSupply@gd-ms.com Small Town Culture This is a small tight nit community which has some disadvantages. The company employs lots of family members, couples, and relatives. Nepotism is big within GDMS in Pittsfield. This can make being outspoken frowned upon and even if they try to practice fairness it is trumped because of the long-standing relationships. Production morale is the worse ever. Excellent programs with long tenured contracts People have long tenure and this can have negative impacts on growth for others It’s okay for warehouse work you learn a lot like how to operate various machinery and learn how to work with different chemical lines but they are strict about certain PPE like earplugs and safety glasses but also don’t care about your safety at the same time, you could be breathing in steam from very hazardous chemicals but they don’t want you wearing a respirator or offer them at all they care more about the contracts they have with the government learn alot safety Good people, bad management. The company used to have a quality first manufacturing philosophy with a balanced life home approach to it's employees. Due to management changes the understanding of the teams skill sets and a loss of customer focus has lead to high turn over and low retention in many areas of the factory. This combined with withering pay scale and crumbling benefits has put product quality and employee value as a close 3rd in priority. Horrible GD doesn’t have a well running QMS. Management and employees complain about having too much work and not enough people. Everything is tribal knowledge and to ask someone for help is pointless. The ones that know what to do get mad about asking them and when you mess something up because you were not trained or told anything about it they complain that you messed up. Permanent employees in department are lazy and management has to bring employees from different states to help them catch up with the work. Free coffee Everything besides free coffee Good benefits, Pay could be better. Jobs are not too bad. Once you learn something though, it can get repetitive. You work with good people. The pay could definitely be better. For the area, it is kind of low, but great benefits. Good job security, not a lot of perks The job security and pay are pretty good. But the work can be boring/slow. Work from home is available to some employees, but most are on site. Old school mentality in most aspects. Welfare for engineers. The environment is terrible. Managers are totally oblivious to the outside world and think they have all the power. Attrition is massive for engineers because everyone pays better. You will double your salary at minimum leaving. Most senior managers don't even make 200k here. There is alot of harassment and asking of inappropriate questions or comments from managers. Here is where careers go to die or engineers go for welfare. Do not come here and if you are a new hire look elsewhere asap even if you have to pay back your signing bonus. The bonus from private will be much higher. Easy work. Micromanagement, incompetent managers, laughable salaries, harassment, old boys club for engineering rejects. Get out ASAP. Go anywhere else. Even new hires wantto GTFO. Great place to work I worked there for 5 weeks, thought I was doing great as indicated by my supervisor. Going forward one the end of the 5 week I get a call from my agency saying that my assignment was over. Very upset NO communication between supervisor and temp agency. And the worst before Thanksgiving !!! Very low blow !!! Nice place Too far to walk to Cafeteria. It is a big corporation. Our business unit was so small GD closed it. The work was interesting and fun. We made robotic camera systems for use on air, water and land platforms (e.g., helicopters, boats and automobiles). Came aboard to build my experience, stayed 12 years. I took the job to help build my resume and get job experience but ended up really enjoying the work, pay and benefits. My position allowed me a lot of creative freedom considering our Government customer. I would have continued to work there if our contracted hadn't been terminated by the Government. Benefits and Work/Life balance Restrictive rules due to our Government contract. Good work/life balance Pretty low stress and lots of interesting work. Pay and benefits are strong but not really the best. Management doesn’t invest adequately in developing and retaining performers, probably due to tight budgets. Lots of great peers have left. Most internal processes are cumbersome and inefficient. Stable work, flexible work plans, remote options Management can be aloof, comp and promotions lag the industry Excellent work environment Good benefits, management and work nvironment. A lot oppoetunities for advancement particularly in Virginia and Florida. Excellent intership opportunities. Neat technology but poor management Worked on some really cool technology and had some great co-workers. Can be stressful since the industry is cyclical. Not knowing if you will be laid off Relaxed Job once everything is learned. Job became very relaxed once I learned most of the facets of the position. Work flow went up and down depending on customer needs, but due to mismanagement, manager required weekend support nearly every month in case of missed production goals. Hard to make plans if you might have to come into work on days off. Hands off management for the most part. Lots of down-time. Lots of down-time. Sometimes slow/low work load. Contractors get short end of the stick. Low Pay, Restrictions on Advancement They offer below industry standard pay. Employees generally can only advance one level per year at most, so this is not great for those who come straight out of college. It's easier to get promoted by leaving and coming back. Employees are expected to track time for every six minutes. Time charging codes often are confusing on what should be used, especially when helping coworkers on a problem that's under a different project. Typical DoD Work A lot of role models in engineering. People are willing to invest time into the success of others. Management suppresses creative freedom - engineers have to take on a significant amount of risk to improve things without management approval. Great Mentor, Talent Recognized No Overtime Pay, Overworked, No Creative Freedom outstanding place to work I worked there 37 years, retired and loved all of it. GDMS is a highly ethical and excellently run company. Salary and benefits are very competitive! Very flexible work environment, excellent HR team and treatment of all employees! Very flexible work environment Nothing Summer intern Interned several years ago so this may be outdated. During my time there I was given a lot of busy work and not anything all that worthwhile to do. Felt disengaged and disconnected, but at the very least everyone was friendly. I feel well cared for working for GDMS. The nature of my work is fulfilling, and I plan to stay for many years. Working for GDMS can best be described as flexible, challenging (in a good way), constructive, and fair. The company provides constant outlets to resolve issues, and higher management very much looks after the well being of their employees. 1 3 Thank you for your review and your loyalty. We are entirely committed to making General Dynamics Mission Systems a great place to work and we appreciate your recognition of our continued efforts. Thanks for being a part of it! Overall a happy atmosphere when working even through a tough times I have never worked for a company whose job was to ensure their employees were first priority. At the same time this created an atmosphere of doing a great job at work. Employers loyalty to their workers and employees loyalty to their company. Greatest place to work None Good place to start off. Good place to work for because of coworkers. Lots of overtime in certain shops. It’s a union company, so everyone gets paid the same no matter how much to do or how less you do. Coworkers, 3 day weekend every other weekend Lots of overtime, low pay and expect a lot from you. We appreciate your feedback regarding your experience and the amount of overtime expected. Rest assured, we are listening and will share this feedback directly with our teams. If you have specific ideas, please contact us at TalentSupply@gd-ms.com. Good luck in your future endeavors! Very inclusive, supportive, but high possibility for burnout The work life balance at GDMS is good. They offer a 9/80 work schedule which allows every other Friday off. Good benefits. Most everyone in the IT department are kind, accepting, and respectful. The wheels keep on churning and there’s always work to be done, but it can get intense, fast paced, and burn you out quickly if you’re not careful. Work life balance, benefits, supportive management, inclusive Burnout, lack of acknowledgment Manufacturing Poor management forced overtime due to project scheduler making poor management of projects cause them to overlap and set up for projects just to tear them down due to issues can literally take a whole shift to finish one motherboard on certain days Pay Everything else Good job variation and program management Great place to work. Thankful for the opportunity that I have had with the company. Nice and stable daily workload that varies. Good culture around the campus. Would recommend to anyone. Travel None Supportive company with fair compensation I spent 10 years at GDMS in the Satcom Technologies division before we were sold to Communication and Power Industries. I had amazing opportunitoes to advance and loved my work. Great compensation and benefits. Benefits, healthcare, compensation Okay job Not too bad a place - Low pay and you have to work hard. Can make a lot more money doing the same work somewhere else. Benefits are good. Coworkers are friendly. Management is nice enough. Productive workplace with advancement opportunity This is a great place to work. Lots of time off as they believe in work life balance. Also lots of advancement opportunities within the company. Would recommend it to anyone. Lots of PTO at hire Short lunch very unorganized but great pay and coworkers it's an okay ish job, if you like standing for more than 6 hours and working with tiny parts, a bit of a boring environment, only great thing is the pay and coworkers good pay, alot of overtime, good coworkers bad training, bad organization, bad teamwork, mandatory overtime Great place to start off As an intern, I was paid well and had great stepping stones to succeed. My manager went the extra mile to help me learn the business. Unfortunately, there is not much room for growth. Good pay for an internship Not much career advancement opportunities Good place to work Good company, benefits, and great people to work with. I was able to grow within the company through multiple promotions. Management was not very supportive towards the end of my tenure. Working with lots of technologies. Great benefits. Lots of overtime, pay was low. Overall very positive work environment Excellent work with good benefits and work life balance. Compensation could be better for the area but team morale and onboarding is top notch. The teams really ensure you get involved early and feel a part of the team. Run Horrible bosses, coworkers are disrespectful and loud. They expect to much from new workers just learning their job. Miserable place to work. If you need a job it will work till you find something else. The pay is not that great for handling the type of materials they use and for what they do. I would not recommend this company to anyone. The day I quit Everything Not satisfied with the way they treat employees. Some parts people are very good. But some management departments treat employees very badly, they always find something to attack, harass you, then make up a bad story talk with your manager that puts you under stress every day. I am not satisfied with working with them. Benefits good Not satisfied with the way they treat employees. Mission Matters Projects at GDMS support the defense of our country and one can take great pride in the work they do here. The people, culture and work/life balance are all great. The 9/80 schedule where you get every other Friday off is an excellent benefit. 9/80 schedule Health insurance premiums on the high side Great work/life balance but opportunities are only possible if management has your back. GD is potentially a great place to work, but the Bloomington MN location falls short. Management does not compensate the best and brightest people who really hold things together. If you're looking for a place to jump in and get recognized for your exceptionalism, this is not the place to be. Other than that you can take PTO whenever you want and the 9/80 schedule is nice. - 9/80 schedule and work/life balance Not compensated for going above and beyond Good place to work just needs a few tweaks Job was at time stressful but overall when the week was over I felt like a part of the team. Processes did seem to change a lot and you couldn't get used to them before a new one would come out. Great place to work, very happy here GDMS is a great place to work. I have been amazed at the high percentage of smart, proactive, friendly people who work at this company. The organization provides meaningful work and has an emphasis on people in terms of work/life balance, engagement, empowerment, and development. Speaking for myself I have been very happy working at GDMS and often recommend it to others. Great culture, interesting work, 9/80 schedule includes every other Friday off. Great company with job longevity I feel a lot of pride where I work, and like nearly all the people I work with. Yes sometimes it gets stressful when you have sudden deadlines and have to meet them, but its not 100% of the time. Good pay, great benefits, work/life balance none really Good people, growth opportunity lacking Great people and management, decent pay, good benefits, flexible hours, appreciative. People, pay Opportunity I feel well cared for working for GDMS. The nature of my work is fulfilling, and I plan to stay for many years. Working for GDMS can best be described as flexible, challenging (in a good way), constructive, and fair. The company provides constant outlets to resolve issues, and higher management very much looks after the well being of their employees. 1 3 Thank you for your review and your loyalty. We are entirely committed to making General Dynamics Mission Systems a great place to work and we appreciate your recognition of our continued efforts. Thanks for being a part of it! Alot of work but bad management Management only cares about production but not about the employees. There's a lot of overtime. There's opportunity growth for the favorited employees A lot of work Bad management and is a manipulator, does not care about health issues and ignores doctors notes. 1 Your experience is not the experience we want anyone to have at General Dynamics Mission Systems. In the last 6 years, we underwent a merger that literally changed everything about our business. Rest assured; we are continuously working to improve our culture for a more positive employee experience. Your feedback will be used to help us train management, improve communication, and drive change throughout the company. Good work life balance Avg pay, good co workers, good benefits and good work life balance. Work is okay, can get dull and projects can turn into long periods of defect fixing. Management isnt great. Lot of non technical people managing or leading technical people isnt a great idea. Work Life Balance Work is boring and Management Attracting and retaining top talent is our priority. After all our business is powered by thinking – original, creative and yes, even critical. We know that we have opportunities to improve and we’re working to make the changes that need to be made in order to make GDMS the best possible place to build a career. If you have specific feedback, please let us know by reach out to us at TalentSupply@gd-ms.com Operator There are more good working people than bad ones. There is a problem with the way they set up the work place. It happens decade ago but unchanged. There are many things to learn. It is a good place for stepping stone. flexible hours eat at your desk Think long and hard before joining this company New software has many glitches. No reports - a lot of manual creation to get what you need. Management wanted us to hit the ground running. Be prepared to work a lot of hours. You better be quick and ultra efficient Great benefits Management wants you to do more then is possible for one person. fun place, at a fast pace. the capstone project at nmsu was great, i had a great client, with great knowledge and advice. overall very helpful. the project was very fast paced with thorough documentation that made the project go smoothly. Perfect Entry Level Job Location I was at was very employee and family oriented, but cannot speak for all locations. Senior Management seemed more focused on bottom line, but local management had their employees best interests in mind. Mid level supervisors always seemed to be on a corporate climb, but there were instances of sincerity. Coworkers are good at their jobs and will help you when necessary. Be on time and do the best you can. 9/80 Schedule worked well for me. Manager easy to talk to. Lots to learn. Room to grow. Very contiencious company. Professional Encouraging Work Environment For the most part, work is what you make it. GDMS does a good job of encouraging employees and bringing synergy to most programs. There is substantial self-paced and teleconference training opportunities. Business Development When I was employed at GD, it was very political, and management was terrible. Only a couple of middle managers were ethical - however there were problems within many of the departments, and frankly, it was not a pleasant place to work. After watching the churn of personnel go through the grinder, and all the lost business - with everyone lacking direction, I am blessed to have left. Life of an Office Engineer vs Field Engineer Most of my career with General Dynamics has been in the field working with the customer. More ""hands-on"" than paperwork. Life in the office, while more stable than constant travel, is more ""paper-work"" than ""hands-on"". This worries me as I fear losing marketable skills. A Typical Day At Work Interacting with subject matter experts to provide intelligent content to customer. Reviewing materials from a variety of sources and confirming the accuracy. Great people and flexibility of schedule Great people and flexibility of schedule, puts family before work. Tons of Personal Time off and holidays. Cons: Hard to advance without education and management has lack of communication Laid back environment Best part of the job for me is the laid back environment. You work a lot, but the people you work with make the experience enjoyable and fun. It's like making friends as well as work colleagues. Great company to work for General Dynamics Mission System is a fantastic company to work for. If one has a positive attitude and is willing to put in the time to develop your skill set within this organization, one will find success. The culture, is positive and the pay is competitive. Love the Place I worked at the General Dynamics C4 Systems site in Scottsdale Arizona from 1995 to 2012. I worked as a Corporate Security Officer. The work was challenging, there was a lot to learn and many jobs required either a Top Secret or at minimum, a Secret clearance The pay was great, the benefits were at least as good as any corporation was offering at the time. I felt well taken care at GD. It was a great company from which I retired in December 2012 Good salary but benefits continue to decrease. Good company to work for and advancement can be had at the main locations. Smaller locations don’t have much room for advancement. Benefits decrease almost yearly with employee costs rising. love working with the associates because the diversity was great Good place to work with good benefits also lots of challenging work opportunities for Advancement also the chance to locate at other facilities teamwork atmosphere Room for advancement The position was very inclusive and I felt a sense of beloging. When given an assignment I was able to receive support and complete each task. The team of assembly techs, engineers, and managers work well in a small group atmosphere. Lack of Leadership Plenty of managers , no leaders. The structure of the organization I am in allows for easy pigeon holing of your career. The first couple of years you may get to learn many new skills but after that finding something new to learn becomes a struggle. The company is fantastic, innovative and eager to stay competitive with other contractors. New executive leadership has great ideas and vision it seems a continuous battle to flow that great vision down through seasoned management that don't promote change. I feel well cared for working for GDMS. The nature of my work is fulfilling, and I plan to stay for many years. Working for GDMS can best be described as flexible, challenging (in a good way), constructive, and fair. The company provides constant outlets to resolve issues, and higher management very much looks after the well being of their employees. 1 3 Thank you for your review and your loyalty. We are entirely committed to making General Dynamics Mission Systems a great place to work and we appreciate your recognition of our continued efforts. Thanks for being a part of it! Productive workplace with great people The people I work with are absolutely fantastic. In the Scottsdale office, there is a close knit environment that kindles professional friendships and a comfortable place for questions and immediate help. No matter what position you hold, you will at some point work with everyone who are all extremely kind and eager to help. Everyone who is currently here wants to be here and it really shows. Management Training is lacking They offer many options for career advancement training, which is amazing, but not too many opportunities to put that training into use. New leads or managers are not taught how to give critiques or how to deal with difficult situations. You have to learn as you go, and hope you don't fail. challenging work If you are in engineering, it is a good place to work. Lots of state of the art activity. Working different programs also provides new challenges within your discipline. An okay place to work, has pros and cons You came in, and mostly did the same thing every day unless you were needed in another area. Unless you didnt already know the job you were doing, someone was there to show you how to perform the task at hand. Management was not the best, due to new supervisor and their lack of knowledge of the job/jobs. Most enjoyable part was working with newly made friends and also the hours wasnt too bad. Assembler Wrong people in management, no prior management experience. Military or former military employees get positions that require degrees and experience that they dont have. Click environment, more happy if you show up to work on time and do a bad job than do a great job and make money for the company without joining the click and sometimes running late Bad environment for an independent thinking individual. General manager does well but floor management needs improvement , no education. Always contradict themselves. Good Defense Contractor I worked at GTE/GD for 39 years, so much has changed as the company expanded and reorganized a number of times. Currently, I think it is a good place to work, but the Army's procurement methods are changing and not conducive to large scale integrators like GD. However, I am sure that will turn around in a few years, the current push to piecemeal solutions to Small and Disadvantaged businesses is short sighted and will not likely provide needed big system solutions that the Army needs. Extremely dedicated employees to making sure the customer is happy and at the same time able to find a good work/home life balance Worked for the company 37 years and do not regret a single minute. A super group of people to work with. Great work environment, everyone has a good attitude. Sometimes challenging with government contract work. Benefits, flexible work times, good salary, plenty of holidays and vacation time. Government contract work Can't trust coworkers in Kilgore Texas My coworker was very spiteful and did not work as a team. She goes to HR and complains about coworkers, thinking it makes her look good. I saw her go to HR and get 2 persons fired in one week. Productive and fun place to work Great place to work. Will give you a good start in your career. Flexible work life balance. Sometimes things get slow and repetitive. They will give you additional training if needed. Workplace Lots of work but management doesn’t believe in hiring more people, upper management doesn’t seem to understand what occurs within their own department, ignorance across the entire business about what each department does which could lead to compliance issues, poorly compensated for all the work that is given to the department Only if you have absolutely no other choice! And even then. be leary! Nepotism and cronyism reign supreme. Atmosphere very cliquish and juvenile, down right hostile! The Union works for the company, the Union officers are either related to someone employed by the company or lives in the area, which is really a big deal to them, but don't really do any work. They just strut around 'acting' important. Solid work GDMS is a large, matrixed organization with sites around the globe. It is focused on engineering solutions and is working to balance technical skills with leadership development. Good defense company. Good for a defense company. Not a very adaptable or dynamic working environment. Advances in management and organizational practice are slow to catch on and not fully effective (i.e. Agile). Some areas very stressful work In the area I was in and the work that I did was very stressful to me personally. You need to be the type of person who can really pay attention to details, work at a very slow & careful pace, and be able to deal with several computer screens and heavy data entry. Most manufacturing jobs are advanced level and require precision and very clear communication skills. Great pay & benefits Not for those who like to move fast It's okay for the area Benefits are terrible, raises are terrible as well. Promotions are hard to come by. Turnover is high. Company will tell you how great it is doing but don't expect to see anything from it. This is a good place to work with little conflicts This place is a good place to work overall and could be better if they looked in the commercial world instead of just government contracts. They have a lot of resources and could utilize them better. The people overall are good except they will hire in some bad eggs that kind of create unnecessary drama in the workplace. If they screened the behavior of the employees like they did in the past they can avoid this. But other employees can be great to work. There are some if you you have to deal with that are uncooperative and have to get a manager to help to get them to help you. I never understood this culture that occurs there. They won't help unless a manger get involved, these extra steps are time consuming and unnecessary But some like it to operate this way. Overall good working enviroment Lack of cooperation to help or get advice, slow and time consuming No room for upward mobility There is no room for upward mobility. As a senior analyst I was treated like a junior analyst. The contract does not understand nor saw any benifit from intelligence analysis. The pay was also well below other competitors productive management definitely needed work in HR department i overall enjoyed working there though the staff was cool and easy to get along with and they pushed me further to work harder and more effectively Great benefits and you make decent pay bad management Interesting work bad management The work is easy and it is enjoyable to do, but some of the people in higher management should not be there in my opinion. Overall it is a very good place to work Has pro's and cons like most work places An old school aerospace company, systems are outdated. GD does not acquire other companies, which is a significant difference in the industry. Could be a great place to work if the leadership were open to modernizing."
KBKG| Great Culture!! I’ve worked here over 5 years and management at the top really cares about their employees. That culture is pushed down throughout the company. They have been growing fast! Fun place to work where high performers are recognized. I really can’t say anything bad. 1 Flexible Work Environment, Great Opportunities & Amazing Co-workers I've worked at KBKG since 2016. The firm is fast-growing and there are lots of opportunities to step up and thrive in this organization. The management team cares about your development and provides training and mentorship programs regularly. Beyond the day-to-day work, the firm offers incredible team events from sports outings and beach days to holiday parties and tournaments. We are given lots of opportunities to volunteer with local organizations so we feel like an integral part of the community. Overall it's really great place to work. Growth opportunities, fun events, great co-workers Could have a more diverse group in management 1 1 Review Not bad. My first job out of college. Benefits, salary pay...have to put in 50 hours per week during tax season but back to a typical 40 hours for the remainder of the year. It varies. 25% travel involved to do site inspections/appraisals. 1 Great Culture!! I’ve worked here over 5 years and management at the top really cares about their employees.

Personify| Just okay. Often left on your own to manage difficult accounts and candidates. Often fearful of losing clients with no clear retention plan. Still a great organization with very bright employees. Better places to work in Austin The primary reason they opened an office in Austin was so they could pay the average employee less than they do in Virginia. Careers here tend to be under paid, over worked, and careers stifled. There is no reason to work at a company that so greatly undervalues the aspirations of their staff, especially when there are 100s of companies in Austin that will pay better. Also, quarterly bonus goals are based on a ratio of billable hours vs admin hours. If you work 38 billed hours and 2 admin hours, one would receive their bonus. If you work 45 billed hours and 10 admin hours, you would not. Cool vertical Poor pay, unrealistic bonus goals passionate place to work with an unclear direction I felt I had to search for basic answers a lot, in their defense they recognize the lack of process and had been heavily investing into it when I was let go. Snacks, relaxed work enviornment Shortage of sales. lack of process Fin and Innovative place to grow • Worked with collaborating with FP&A team to generate reports • Learned valuable excel and salesforce skills • Fast-Paced • Allowed room for growth • Fun environment Great folks to work with. Except a few individuals, most people around are super great. The Dev team is very strong and knowledgeable. They can make miracles happen if only they had the right time allocated and the requirements were better planed. Overall, this is probably the best company I have worked with. I am grateful for the professional development I am getting in here. The products Personify makes are outstanding and top of the line. Yeah some snacks and coffee Too many meetings... Great Environment Encouraging family environment. Great core values. Strong team players, Great resources and benefits. They truly care for their employees. The facility is beautiful and a wonderful place to work. Great environment, great people None Poor Work Enviroment Management lacks the skills to lead. Leadership is never around and are unapproachable. Employees are scared of losing their jobs. Benefits are not great and they are too expensive. This company will make you feel like a failure everyday. If you want to hate yourself everyday this is the place to be. This place is ridiculous They make you take an assesment exam just to get an interview. Being in my 40's I'm pretty sure I do not care when a train left a station traveling at 100mph and when it would arrive to its destination. Sad they are willing to put people through this kind of scrutiny just to pay them a low ball salary. Non All in my notes Really hard place to work after acquisition Personify was acquired by a venture capital firm shortly after I started and this was majorly disruptive. We lost most of our development staff and it was impossible to keep projects moving. I have discovered that the office that I worked at has now been closed. Poor benefits Looks can be deceiving. WFH policy which seems to be frowned upon when used too often. Weekly company meetings are sales team centric. Very expensive insurance plans. High employee turn over. Company is owned by VC group. Very cliquey company environment. Upper Mgmt seems distant and unapproachable. Nice offices, Free coffee and catered lunches Healthcare, lack of technical talent due to high turn over rate Work in progress Slowly phasing out VA Office. All resources are being allocated to the TX Austin. Letting seasoned Personify vets go due to the bottom dollar. Thorougly enjoyef working for Personify, prior to buy out. Time of Transition Personify is in another era of transition, which is about the third one it's had in so many years. This is the second transition period I've experienced in the time I have been at the organization. The challenge for my position is that I have been stripped of some of the major abilities I need to have in order to do my job effectively, and now find myself having to jump through hoops that provide zero value to clients, in order to ensure that I can make my year end bonus. My particular manager is awesome, and the VP of my department is awesome, and even really like our COO and CEO when I have the opportunity to interact with them. The coworkers really can't be beat.

Also, quarterly bonus goals are based on a ratio of billable hours vs admin hours. If you work 38 billed hours and 2 admin hours, one would receive their bonus. If you work 45 billed hours and 10 admin hours, you would not. Cool vertical Poor pay, unrealistic bonus goals passionate place to work with an unclear direction I felt I had to search for basic answers a lot, in their defense they recognize the lack of process and had been heavily investing into it when I was let go. Snacks, relaxed work enviornment Shortage of sales. lack of process Fin and Innovative place to grow • Worked with collaborating with FP&A team to generate reports • Learned valuable excel and salesforce skills • Fast-Paced • Allowed room for growth • Fun environment Great folks to work with. Except a few individuals, most people around are super great. The Dev team is very strong and knowledgeable. They can make miracles happen if only they had the right time allocated and the requirements were better planed. Overall, this is probably the best company I have worked with. I am grateful for the professional development I am getting in here. The products Personify makes are outstanding and top of the line. Yeah some snacks and coffee Too many meetings... Great Environment Encouraging family environment. Great core values. Strong team players, Great resources and benefits. They truly care for their employees. The facility is beautiful and a wonderful place to work. Great environment, great people None Poor Work Enviroment Management lacks the skills to lead. Leadership is never around and are unapproachable. Employees are scared of losing their jobs. Benefits are not great and they are too expensive. This company will make you feel like a failure everyday. If you want to hate yourself everyday this is the place to be. This place is ridiculous They make you take an assesment exam just to get an interview. Being in my 40's I'm pretty sure I do not care when a train left a station traveling at 100mph and when it would arrive to its destination. Sad they are willing to put people through this kind of scrutiny just to pay them a low ball salary. Non All in my notes Really hard place to work after acquisition Personify was acquired by a venture capital firm shortly after I started and this was majorly disruptive. We lost most of our development staff and it was impossible to keep projects moving. I have discovered that the office that I worked at has now been closed. Poor benefits Looks can be deceiving. WFH policy which seems to be frowned upon when used too often. Weekly company meetings are sales team centric. Very expensive insurance plans. High employee turn over. Company is owned by VC group. Very cliquey company environment. Upper Mgmt seems distant and unapproachable. Nice offices, Free coffee and catered lunches Healthcare, lack of technical talent due to high turn over rate Work in progress Slowly phasing out VA Office. All resources are being allocated to the TX Austin. Letting seasoned Personify vets go due to the bottom dollar. Thorougly enjoyef working for Personify, prior to buy out. Time of Transition Personify is in another era of transition, which is about the third one it's had in so many years. This is the second transition period I've experienced in the time I have been at the organization. The challenge for my position is that I have been stripped of some of the major abilities I need to have in order to do my job effectively, and now find myself having to jump through hoops that provide zero value to clients, in order to ensure that I can make my year end bonus. My particular manager is awesome, and the VP of my department is awesome, and even really like our COO and CEO when I have the opportunity to interact with them. The coworkers really can't be beat. Best part of the job is feeling like you're going in every day to hang out with your friends, which is nice. telecommuting flexibility Competitive Recruiting Firm Good Firm to work for with alot of activities for employees to get involved. Team environment and built for everyone to make it. Productive and Fun workplace Great company with a fun and supportive management. Excellent workplace culture, highly motivating team members. Challenging and Innovative, becoming a top leader in outsource consulting and recruiting. Quiet and open Personify is a good place to work it, small enough to know everyone but large enough to have new opportunities.

Red Hat Software|" Professional work environment Professional work environment with highest standard of ethics. Worked in the areas of Linux, Solaris AIX and VMware support environments both building and supporting servers. 2 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? My teammates. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Constant increases in case loads with no help in sight. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Started great, but IBM creeped in to Red Hat over time and ruined it. 1 Great company going over a long transformation Red Hat it is a great company to work for. The past 3 years have been a continuous re-orgs which creates distractions and vagueness among associates. It might be part of the fast growing pains, but the core of the culture it is still there. always something new to learn, support from managers and peers too many changes per year 1 Ambiente de trabajo estresante No llevo mas de tres meses en la compañia, y te tratan como si ya fueras senior en el rol, te piden cosas que tienes que ir manejando sobre la marcha, sin mucha capacitación o con el sentido de porque hacerlo. 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? leaving it What is the most stressful part about working at the company? the culture is identify and punish instead on encourage and coach What is the work environment and culture like at the company? untrustworthy and sneaky. No one can handle face to face issue resolution. Everyone goes whining to manager What is a typical day like for you at the company? stressful and under constant scrutiny Good company with stable job Management is good , you can retire here if you keep performing, remote opportunities and supportive management, the only area for improvement is pay scale Excellent Work Culture The managers are supportive and every work day has a purpose. Employees are always encouraged to upskill and there are options to progress in the company. You need to drink the Kool Aid to be successful there I was in the consulting division. It was impossible to get out and get another job within Red Hat, unless I wanted to take a 30K+ drop in salary. You also needed to have all Tried to learn new skills. They gave me the training, but never got apply it in the real world. They kept on putting me on the same type projects based on my strengths. Manager only cared about you billing. Got a new manager every 12-18 months. They said they cared about your advancement, but only seemed to care about theirs as they moved around the company. For me to get promoted, I had to go in front of a review board and do all this nonsense presentations, mock customer meetings, etc to get promoted. Like I had the time to prepare all that and keep the customers happy. Content As A Service Product Owner Red Hat is a wonnderful company. They are going through a lot changes and reorgs. New management doesnt embrace the open culture and family atmosphere. Distance themseleves from those already there. Do value those who put in the effort Good experience It was a good play to work. I enjoyed it. Good experience for a starter. Environment to excel. Friendly staff throughout. Managent structure is solid. Great WLB, lower pay, chil job Go to RH for WLB and a relaxed environment. Pay is lower than in other companies but your output is lower as well. The workload is basically how much you can handle. Great work / life balance Great culture, very open, management is interested in your growth and goals. It can take a while for a newbie to get acquainted with how Red Hat does things. There are some growing pains as they have expanded under IBM. Productive and fun place to work with a couple of ping pong tables and really nice cafeteria. This is a company that you honestly get out what you put into it. I worked at Red Hat for a total of 13yrs and I would say it was a joy to engage with so many talented and kind people who shared the same vision you do. The technology you get to work on. The compentation could be a bit more inline with industry. Not the same since acquisition Red Hat used to be a great company with a stellar culture. Now, we’re just a division of IBM. The people are great, but there’s a lot of turnover. The management really cares about our people, but their hands are tied, and no one has the resources they need to be successful, except maybe in sales. It’s a fine place to work if you’re happy to just clock in and out every day. Flexible hours A great company to work for which keeps get rated in the top for best companies to work for. A work day is pretty flexible for me as I work from home. Not too many meetings to clutter the week. The fellow engineers are awesome and super helpful and really care about the culture and work env. There is plenty of time and encouragement to learn. Inclusive work culture, Plenty of opportunity to work and learn, Management is amazing and really care about their folks, Work life balance is great too and Bonus are strong averaging nearly 23% Salaries are average for the industry, 3% 401k match Productive and provide the training you need to succeed. A typical work day consist of assisting employees with questions by phone or email. Answering questions from team members who may need help with a task, and keeping your manager updated on any new issues. I worked remote but had great coworkers. Nice work environment and office design, Free snacks and drinks available at all times in the cafeteria, No micro management. They will let you go for no reason, I completed and passed all my training, and they let me go on the day I was supposed to start on my own, Bad business practice, Apply with caution. Red Hat, now part of IBM, has always been a free-thinker kind of company, which is good and bad. I did get a Red Hat. It takes a ""Red Hat"" kind of person to fully appreciate working at Red Hat. I am not that kind of person. I was surprised, and then not, when I saw a ""Red Hatter"" playing World of Warcraft in the office, and equally as much when the coworker I was with dismissed that completely. Most surprising was when I started my first task and a coworker looked over my shoulder and said ""Oh, you are using <xyz> to do your builds."" My response was ""Yeah, that's what is in place already, why change it?"" The response was more like ""Why not change it?!"" I soon realized that I could have rewritten the application in COBOL. The point is there is very little structure, little discipline about how things are done, at least in the group I was in. I guess I would summarize the experience by saying: ""They really need some adults working there."" Again, that was my group. There are some very opinionated people at Red Hat, too, which I think goes along with the lack of adult leadership and the ""do what you want"" atmosphere. And I do mean opinionated - I got into an argument over NOTHING that lasted five weeks, I stood my ground so as not to set a precedent of getting walked on. It was ridiculous, but not everyone there is that way. Great benefits, Six weeks of PAID FMLA, people use for post-natal activities, Liberal work-at-home policy, regardless of the pandemic, Very easy going atmosphere, No game machines in the work areas Very easy going atmosphere, Lack of adult supervision (meaning: managers who set standards, etc.), Part of IBM (which might bring in some adults), Refusal to toss out really bad systems and write replacements with modern tech Good Company Enjoyable work and smart coworkers. Lots of opportunities for advancement as well. Consulting can be difficult at times with travel and client demands but overall would recommend. Good work life balance Decent work like balance vs comp, Management can be challenging. That’s aboth all I got to say about that. Strong tech stack, product Development& architecture Emerging Technologies Company The company has awesome benefits. Pre COVID, traveled every week as a senior consultant. Project Managers traveled just as much as well. Training on Red Hat software is free, and you can take the certification exams as many times as one chooses. Mangers sit down with you once a quarter to go over your performance, which is a plus. The company wants you to grow your skills and your education, so it's a great place to expand your portfolio. They also offer a stock purchase program at a discounted rate. Great health benefits and a generous maternity leave package for both parents. High turnover rate for consultants. Burnout is common. OK pay, good benefits, not great culture The role was not as described and the team was not very welcoming. There is a culture of bullying at Red Hat that was disturbing. And there was no process to handle bullying. The problem is lack of oversight over individual teams. remote work Professional work environment Professional work environment with highest standard of ethics. Worked in the areas of Linux, Solaris AIX and VMware support environments both building and supporting servers. 2 Space A lot of space to do your job. Nice office space -- lots great snacks and free lunches. Nice location, and great people. Quite work space -- very modern and high tech. 1 1 Supportive Culture I would not believe there exists such a company like Redhat, or should I say I just belong here? I always feel I am learning new things and excel at my work. Supportive culture, great pay, great people. 3 Great experience -permanent or temporary Work-life balance Team setting very helpful. Pay & benefits Contracting through a third party and their benefits were solid. Job security and advancement As a contractor I felt the need to work harder to keep my advancement and contract renewed every 3 months. Enjoyed the team culture and learned so much about agile methods. Management Always difficult as a contractor but manager, director, and executive team were supportive. Culture Teams worked across department via workshops to help improve collaboration and knowledge sharing across teams. I most liked the collaborative and transparent team culture there. Overall Like living in a big city such as New York, SFO, Boston, Philly, DC - was an amazing experience that I will never forget. Highly recommend working there in any capacity rather full-time or part time. The team Agile dynamics there were the best I have experienced anywhere. INVEST model for user stories was a core takeaway. The culture is unmatched anywhere; very special company with the 'small company feel' and 'big company resources' Very open and transparent. Continually seeks freedom of speech and opinion. Ideas are always welcome. They truly believe that they can achieve more with a community of developers and architects than as a company alone. They live it, breath it and practice it over and over again every single day. Good place to be very fun and loving people. They are like family and create a working environment where team and and mutual respect is the order of the day. This creates an atmosphere of learning and professional advancement. The original open source company Though many companies now open source their products, Red Hat is the pioneer at making open source a viable business model and truly integrating it's principals into all aspects of the business. Though this can in some ways slow things down when we must openly debate ideas, seek feedback, etc. I would not trade that for the top-down decision making approach I see at many other companies. After 11 years at Red Hat I still feel challenged by the work and excited about our future. It is not exactly the same now that we are owned by IBM however I must say both companies are doing a great job keeping Red Hat independent and not erasing the value that IBM sought in Red Hat's culture and business model. work/life balance, culture Own your own career approach to advancement I had a terrible manager who lied and hired me for a job I never got. There are many great people at Red Hat. Unfortunately I ended up with a nasty condescending manager with very little technical background in security. He hired me as a cloud security & deployment engineer then pulled a bait and switch on me and gave me an auditor's job. He then rated my performance on the new role he gave me with no previous audit experience. It was a disaster working for him. I never got to perform the role I interviewed for at Red Hat. So buyer beware. Insert review here. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. Apparently I need to type 150 characters in order to meet the requirements, to make this form happy, Boo hiss. Na In red hat coworkers are been respectful, always willing to learn and to teach . Great team work . Focus and determine to achieve their golds . No racism Opportunity for growth and innovation There's always room for growth, innovation, learning and the ability to work remotely which helps with family/worklife balance. Each day brings new challenges and issues to address. Solid company Innovative company allowing advancement opportunities if you know the right people. Need to develop clear career pathing for mid-level career professionals. Fast-paced, results-driven company Fast-paced company, not extremely inclusive but working towards diversity. There is an emphasis on technical knowledge here and there are expectations to learn the product portfolio quickly Great experience A very progressive and diverse workplace. Free snacks, coffee, drinks etc.A very google-esk environment. There were many open and private places you can use. It is generally and open work environment. great collaborative environment Productive and Fun Atmosphere - Cool Work space Great place to work! Work/Life Balance is great! I learned a lot in this position. Great culture and they really value all input! Great place to work! open source amazing culture I loved every minute of my 8 years at Red Hat. I learned so much about open source software and sales. Excellent top to bottom sales management and sales structure Overall a good company! Good company, good management. Sometimes software quality is questionable. Requires travel and hours can be unstable during crunch times. Very fast paced learning required. Innovation and culture are key Worked there several years ago so not sure how the new blend of IBM and Red Hat is going. There were several reorganizations going on as departments move around. Employees set their pace and can work anywhere in the downtown Raleigh cool building. Lots of collaboration. It was odd my role was reorganized out and soon after there were postings for similar roles once they found the gap of what I was doing. Opportunity for exposure to emerging software technology As an account manager for Red Hat, you have the opportunity to work with customers in helping them achieve efficiency and scalability within their IT environment. RH offers customers effective emerging technology solutions in their DevOps, automation and cloud needs. There is an open source culture which transcends within the organization. However, there are times when progression or career mobility is limited due to being in a remote office. Good place to work depending on your role I enjoyed the first few years, however it is unclear how the acquisition bu IBM will impact company culture. The company provides great technology based on community development model. Ability to work remotely. Knowledgable coworkers. Management is weak and disengaged. Productive and fun workplace I really appreciated the valuable knowledge and experience I received at Red Hat. Everyone working at Red Hat is intelligent, hard-working, and knows what it takes to get their jobs done. Professional work environment Professional work environment with highest standard of ethics. Worked in the areas of Linux, Solaris AIX and VMware support environments both building and supporting servers. 2 Decent Above average company and I loved the pay. It was very demanding and a lot of pressure but if you can handle it you’ll be okay. The people I worked with were great though 2 good place and people to work with. Good team members, loving people, fun place I call my home. Every body have one main goal to achieve at the end of the day. They should Just keep up the good job. 2 Great company culture There are things about any company that will drive you crazy (red tape, things don't move fast enough, not enough budget, whatever it is) but at the end of the day I can genuinely say that Red Hat is a good and ethical company that truly cares about it's employees. You can feel it in the way they invest in us. If you're willing to invest back, it's a great relationship with endless possibilities. Fun Place to Work very Inclusive of Culture My time as an Intern was phenomenal in Summer 2019! Red Hat is rated top 15 places to work. Everyone has great energy and are a very inclusive workplace for all cultures, great community service, flexible work hours, come as you are and wear what you want to wear, as long as it appropriate and it located in a great downtown area. The employees' energy here was always welcoming and friendly across all departments including the CEO, CIO, and CFO! Abierta? quizá el software pero no la cultura organizacional Dicen tener una cultura abierta pero al final no se refleja en buena parte de los colaboradores y varios líderes. En México el clima no es sano, se percibe que en otros países sí lo es. Se nota constante miedo a perder el trabajo, entonces muchos no dicen lo que realmente piensan, líderes incluidos. Vi diferentes tipos de acoso por parte de líderes hacia los colaboradores. La gestion de Recursos Humanos es muy limitada. Por otra parte, la compensacion y beneficios estaban acorde, las oficinas muy nuevas y cómodas. Se aprende mucho...a costa del tiempo que le quitas a tu vida personal. Great people, large-scale enterprise culture It's hard to say what impact the impending acquisition by IBM will have on Red Hat. There are many great, hard-working people within the company. That said, it definitely has more of a large-scale enterprise culture (red tape, politics) than I had expected. fast paced different company fast paced company where employees are often free to develop their positions and future. Management is another thing though, petty infighting and egos are beginning to become the norm. We'll see what IBM does to the culture Productive, Fun, and Challenging A typical day at work would start with prioritizing the requirements for the day and address any hot issues. I would learn how to address any problem/task, and come up with a way to resolved the situation with as less business impact as possible. Management was also challenge depending on who your dealing with. The hardest part of the job would balance company needs against Industry policy. The most enjoyable part of the job I would have say the people. incredible place to work Meritocracy is rife great conversations to be had with anyone in the company you are surrounded by some incredibly intelligent people all motivated to better the company working remote Red Hat Embraces the Culture and The People of the Org Red Hat continues to be a leader in Open Source Communities, but even more importantly, a leader in embracing its people and culture. I would recommend Red Hat to anyone that is looking to join an organization where the people are the most valuable asset. Wonderful Red Hat is a great company and is worth a lot of money. $34B to IBM to be exact. It has a wonderful culture of collaboration and transparency that has been difficult to maintain as more employees are hired. culture growth Great place to work Red Hat is about culture, the culture fit is as important as the job fit. If you fit the culture, you'll thrive. If not, you will not last long. Great company culture great place to work great place to work just crazy hours of work not a paper balance with life afterwork, time will change between days and nights day by day got me sick had to look for something different great pay rush environment Known for Open Culture Enjoyed open culture and focus on customers. Enjoyed ability to work cross-functionally and change jobs laterally and horizontally. Valued the company's focus on Diversity and Inclusion, Great place to work I worked at Red Hat during the summer in an internship role. I mainly worked with front-end technologies, but wish I got more work at times. Overall a good experience and fun place to work at. Artig og skiftende arbeid Red Hat har et dynamisk arbeidsmiljoe. Det er allltid skiftende, og der gjoer det interessant, for det er alltid noe nytt aa laere. Great place to work overall Red Hat is a great place to work where diversity is valued and employees are rewarded profusely for their effort. Culture is King at Red Hat - but sometimes gets in the way of innovation. It was okay but stressful Its was a good place to do like volunteer work for but not a lifetime employment. I learned my cash handling skills here and had good people to work with but it wasn't my type of work. Great Culture! The best part of Red Hat is the people. The culture is work hard play hard, casual dress in the office. I worked remotely as a TAM and the travel was about 15%. There are so many training opportunities. Great Place to Work I was a contract employee but enjoyed every minute of working at Red Hat. The culture was great and management really took the time to care about their employees. Professional work environment Professional work environment with highest standard of ethics. Worked in the areas of Linux, Solaris AIX and VMware support environments both building and supporting servers. 2 Good place to work Good place to work, unique culture and people. Open source software, lots of freedom to choose how you work (depending on department), except if you work for IT Fun work activities, good people Acquired by IBM I miss my cooworkers Red Hat was one of my favorite company i ever worked for. I was working remotely too so that worked out well. I worked with great, smart, friendly and hard worker team. I will miss them a lot. 1 1 Productive and a fun workplace Lots of technologies and products to learn about and get familiarized with. My mentor was really enthusiastic and wanted me to pick up on expectations. I gained proficiency in Python, Git, GitHub, shell scripting and some networking tools like OVS, DPDK, LNST. Supporting everything This job isn't just end-user support. I spend my day supervising our provisioning and life cycle of laptops for the company, loaner hardware, a walk up support desk, corporate leadership support team, and field support services. Culture Politics Becoming very corporate Less of the freedom loving open source mentality and more of the middle micro management from new outside people managers. Recent IBM acquisition does not sit well with many. New hires have gone down in quality and individual contributors fail upward once a project fails and there is nowhere to put them. Middle Management Good culture, great place to work but changing Good culture and a great place to work, but the work environment is changing. Do your due diligence. They are open source, almost militantly so and they do not suffer people who do not subscribe to the open source model. Fun Non profit Social gathering for ladies over 50, not a paid job. It was strictly volunteer and no restrictions as to time donated. Various community oriented functions. fun none Interesting company Culturally, it is a bit of a cult. You are either for open source or not. It has softened in the past several years, but still a staple of the culture. Pay is competitive, still the opportunity to make your job what you want to make it. Management is spotty. Flexible work environment, Work from home opportunities Mgmt/Leadership is gaps Great Culture High stressed job with very demanding tasks. Work vs meetings schedule does not allow you to fully focus on day to day functions. A very high learning environment. just like the 2 bit companies that look at for themselves only Red Hat has fat contracts and making money, lots of it, but in the end is poorly managed just like everyone else. It is too bad that Red Hat is not aware of the damage they are doing to themselves. Unix, Linux Open source, enterprise release, the environment can be locked down, stable, utilization of hardware resources are very well utilized. I have a flavor of open source Linux for my primary OS at home. Stable None Great place to work! Lots of freedom to do your job. Lots of emphasis on open source and collaborating with the open source community. Strong communication skills a must as you generally work with people in multiple time zones. Very casual, open environment Compensation is not as good as other companies Great Company with a relaxed work culture Highly dependable and smart employees. A fun place to work at which is very relaxed. Flexibility to work from anywhere as long as the work is done. Very supportive managers and leaders who take an actual interest in your career and the path you want to take professionally. Free snacks Good company Good place to work as an engineer. Difficult as a manager sometimes to apply discipline. Very associate focused company and corporate culture. Very good benefits Benefits Have great benefits. From Life insurance to Lawyer services and Employ Stock Sharing. Work with some of the smartest people in the field and have endless opportunities for advancement. Loved my time at Red Hat Great company to work at. Co-workers are all motived to get problems solved as quickly as possible so they don't re-occur. I would definitely love to work there again. Productive and smart people I had some of my qualms there. But all in all it seems like a good place to grow in a startup culture. There are different people who work on different things and you just have to network to find out who are working on your same projects and have your same background. Snacks Snacks Awesome Culture and challenging work I like the culture and open source. The work environment is fast paced and challenging. Lot of opportunities to work in new technology and learning new skills A Learning Experience Working here prepared me for other jobs. This job gave me the training I needed and the knowledge necessary to go out into the job market and have the skills necessary. Productive and fun working place (games and gym) Red Hat is a Linux Open Source environment. You can learn a great deal there if you've never used the Linux operating system. The people there are very knowledgeable, open to suggestions, informative and inviting. The culture is not only to work and share experiencing among others, but to also bond with the community and give back. Some days can be stressful, however if you're working with the right team, your coworkers will always be available to assist you. I wished my position, wasn't a contractual one. I really liked it there. Professional work environment Professional work environment with highest standard of ethics. Worked in the areas of Linux, Solaris AIX and VMware support environments both building and supporting servers. 2 Good company, best days are behind it (?) Positives Stable at the very top (C-level) Impressive CEO Very good job security, financial stability, conservative/risk adverse Excellent benefits Thought-leadership on some technologies Great company Mixed mobility; Under-trained management 8 Excellent Red Hat practices what it preaches as a Free and Open Source Software Company. This is a big plus as you get feedback from folks in other organizations that the company partners with for many of the projects. That gives a much higher level of confidence that the way a problem is being approached is the correct one. It reminds me of the way we approach things in a scientific research environment. You have to meet requirements not only from your company but also from other teams on other companies and organizations. Priorities change 3 Great Place to work with smart people. Great company with great vision. Lots going on so things could be confusing at time. Lots of support and education. Lots of very smart folks working on cool problems. Highly recommend. Good place to work Freedom to grow your career, open to new ideas, overall a good place to work. Hardest part of job is trying to influence many different voices and opinions on a common course of action. Fun, Chaotic Depending on your team, Red Hat could either be a dynamic, exciting place to work or a confusing, chaotic one. Red Hat is growing very quickly. It will either take off or crash. Put on an island My third day in my position my manager was fired for unknown reasons. I was on an island and working without direction but made the best of what was given to me. I did not have a whole lot of support and had to work alone. Nice area Bad position to be in Great Company if the role is right Great company overall. Good company to work at if you are in engineering or presales and you have the skills to excel. Very much a meritocracy in those roles. This is an engineering company first, and a sales/marketing company second. If you work in sales, marketing, or channel mgmt you may or may not have long term success. Goals are intense, timelines are short, pressure is high. While all those things exist nearly everywhere, there are amplified here. Overall company culture is engineering focused, and as a result can take a dim view of non-engineering roles. Value of non-engineering roles is often trivialized or scorned. successful, growing company. Open Source pioneer. Good product mix, good integrations between products. Youthful, energetic culture. Poor or very poor culture can exist if you are not in an engineering-related role. Good Learning curve and work life balance Flexible hours, will learn cutting edge technology, have work life balance, good place to grow in career. There will be lot of fun activities which happens every month. Workplace culture is good. Work was swell As a temp, I enjoyed working with my team and my manager. It was a temporary job but they treated me fairly. The perks are nice and everyone was good to work with. Was a very good company located close to home. Corporate made some changes and the company began to suffer. We were a small office located close to home which made it an attractive job with good pay and benefits! Close to home, working with good people The changes our corporate office made N/a Good: company, culture, balance, opportunities, people, industry, time at work, location, coworkers, benefits, growth potential Bad: management not always the best Great company to work for! I enjoyed my time with Red Hat. The culture and perks of working in such a high-tech and progressive atmosphere was a pleasure. The place an emphasis on inclusion and meritocracy which made everyone feel part of the team and welcomed input from everyone. Culture, cutting-edge technology, work environment, ability to work remotely. May lack direction due to exponential growth Very Good Place to Work I interned here over the summer. This is a great company. People and culture are fantastic. If you have an opportunity to work here then you should definitely consider. Some teams are better than others I learned that I value consistency and structure in a workplace environment, especially regarding management and leadership which is lacking or non-existent in certain teams within IT. Workers were often overworked and understaffed with little advancement opportunities and promised things that were almost never fulfilled. Get in with the right teams and you may have a good experience. Collaboration among various teams and resolving issues completely was the most enjoyable and rewarding aspect of the job. Collaborating among my own team proved to be the hardest due to workplace culture, morale, and lack of professionalism. meeting and collaboratively working with other teams and individuals globally worker turnover on various shifts, lack of consistency/structure/professionalism, drama Red Hat is like a cult The Red Hat company culture is like a religion. They constantly talk about Open Source like it is the only option for software development and hate any other business models. I have worked in many technology companies in the past and never seen any company disparage their customers and competition as much as Red Hat. They believe they are the only option a customer has for any software and talk about how stupid their (and competitor's) customers are. Red Hat believes OSS is the source of all innovation despite that fact that Open Source is just a way to commoditize real innovation done elsewhere. The company has never had a fresh product idea ever they just jump in front of any Open Source project that seems to be picking up steam. Internally they are stale and unwelcoming to any new ideas that are brought forth. Many of the employees are long timers and cannot understand new processes or productivity increasing technology that others new folks might bring up. Overall it is a company that wants validation of it's approach and process even if it's proven to be broken. Back stabbing, whining and corporate politics are the rule. Be forwarned. It's like 'the Witch's Candy House in Hansel and Gretel' Looks great on the outside but before you know it you're in the oven. Lot's of expenses by employees on lunches, dinners, drinks etc. for themselves backstabbing culture, unlimited complaining, squash any good ideas from new team, Management is exceptionally underhanded, poor attitude towards employees, describe their own customers as stupid Productive and exciting place to work! Great place and great energy. Constantly busy. Little downtime and also worked while on vacation. Learn and work with the best. Can excel your career wherever you go. Great place to work Great place to work. Very collaborative environment and open to share any new ideas and discuss with anyone at any level in the organization. Leader in open source N/a * The are still trying to reinvent the wheel. * The company is still growing and trying to find it's way. * It's a very interesting workplace * Very friendly atmosphere * They have some of the most hidden jems that work there very smart individuals. N/a N/a Wonderful place to wirk Red Hat is a wonderful company. Great culture and has a very diverse atmosphere. Great leadership. I most enjoyable part of my day to day role is connecting with other and learning more about what they contribute to the company. Diverse Culture Compensation An enjoyable workplace In my opinion, the people you work with make a difference as to determine how your typical day will go. When you work in a hostile environment, it weighs heavy on you and I think it affects your job performance. I never go to a job looking to make friends, but being able to be cordial and polite is a positive asset. free lunch during meetings scheduled at lunch, employee appreciation horrible benefits, hostile environments"

The company pays really well and has high expectations of the employee performance. Salary, knowledge, culture Working balacne Boring and uncomfortable I was an intern and I felt very apart from the rest of the staff and was not given clear guidance. I was not trusted to submit any error reports without my manager first confirming an error and was not invited to sit in company wide meetings. There is a strong effort to create a work life balance with occasional happy hours in the lunchroom and office activities but I personally felt out of place and uncomfortable but that could have been due to a large age gap snacks fun work place very good company with friendly environment and perfect work-life balance. They have snacks, beverages and company activities. Financial Intern I enjoyed my time as an intern here. The scope for learning is great here.

Management was nice and helpful. Best part was seeing my work added to the newest release. Great place to work There is great opportunity for anyone seeking to advance their career in finance.

Disorganized, lots of cross functional jobs, business is slow and qualified workers are not encouraged to work independetly Exciting environment place NumeriX is a leader and also very horizontal hierarchical management structure. The company pays really well and has high expectations of the employee performance. Salary, knowledge, culture Working balacne Boring and uncomfortable I was an intern and I felt very apart from the rest of the staff and was not given clear guidance. I was not trusted to submit any error reports without my manager first confirming an error and was not invited to sit in company wide meetings. There is a strong effort to create a work life balance with occasional happy hours in the lunchroom and office activities but I personally felt out of place and uncomfortable but that could have been due to a large age gap snacks fun work place very good company with friendly environment and perfect work-life balance. They have snacks, beverages and company activities. Financial Intern I enjoyed my time as an intern here. The scope for learning is great here. The management is quite supportive and the environment is quite freindly. They really know their stuff These guys really know their stuff! I’ve learned so much since I started here and it’s all because of the incredible guidance, support, and mentorship I’ve received from everyone who works here. I feel more prepared to enter the workforce after graduation. Supportive work environment NumeriX is great because there are enough people to back you up if you’re running behind for any reason, but usually we don’t get more work than we can handle so there’s more than enough time to get everything done in a day. Best job I’ve had Best job I’ve ever had. Was able to learn and grow as much as I wanted. A lot of jobs just want you to do a specific task and stay in those lines. At NumeriX I had the freedom to learn outside my job role if I wanted to, which I did. Close knit culture I have been here since 2020 and feel like the culture is very close knit. There are such smart and motivated people working here, it makes coming to work easy. The company is growing exponentially and doing big things in the industry and I just feel lucky to be a part of it! Would definitely recommend I would definitely recommend NumeriX for work. The job is not only challenging but fun. There is room for growth and I’ve also learned a lot since I started. Plus, upper management cares about employee wellbeing. Room to grow They weren’t lying when they said I’d be able to move up within the company. It took time for me to show that I was capable of taking on more responsibility, but at the end of the day they came through and that’s all that matters. Great learning environment Speaking from personal experience, taking the time to perfect your craft and applying feedback will take you far. It’s a great learning environment and there are plenty of resources that you can take advantage of. Not bad - Hard working day - Consistent managerial feedback - Valuable experience - Fun and easy-going work culture - Long days at times - Educational opportunities & growth potential Fantastic company – just not the right role Financial Validation wasn’t a great fit for me, however the company itself including leadership was phenomenal so I’m giving them a solid 5 stars. Almost wish I enjoyed the job more because NumeriX was a really great company to work for. A great experience It was a great experience. Enjoyed the environment and my coworkers. Overall, a very friendly and safety-conscious workplace. There’s room to grow, but I didn’t take advantage of it. The money is excellent I’m not going to beat around the bush: the money here is excellent. I can’t speak for any other role than my own, but the sky really is the limit when it comes to how much you can earn. I didn’t even make half as much at my last job. Engineer Intern Fast-paced enough to make time fly by, laid back enough not to stress too much. First time in a real work setting but learning the ropes was easy enough. It was a good starting point.

Prometric|" Interesting product A little all over the place but generally a good company. The technology is improving and fun to work with the broad range of clients. Good managers to help. Compañerismo La señora Fuentes es totalmente inhumana dejándome sin beneficio alguno en medio de la pandemia, violando las leyes laborares del Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico. No es líder y sin capitán el barco se hunde. Salario Personal Meh The pay socks! During the interview I was told there would be perks for being at work. I have yet to see anything like that. There were 3 people that was given extra work that received gift cards. I wasn't a part of that group. 😕. Na It's a clickish company Insufficient training Not enough training to meet metrics and make candidates happy. Employees are not valued or paid well enough to care. No room for advancement. Very clique-y and the call center environment is toxic. Tips Management needs to give more recognition. And it’s seems management gets an awful lot for the minimal work they do as the Tcas put in the most work to then be having to fight too hard for the smallest increase of a raise . That is aside from the fact that the base rate is too low For what is it is we are trained to do. Underpaid and no leadership involvement. I love my job most days. However, when need assistance there is no one to reach out to. Also, way underpaid for the fact that I am to respond to emails whenever received. I am required to work 24/7 yet not paid for this. 401 k and holiday pay Can’t take vacation during the summer because company won’t hire additional help. No growth or benefits No professional growth or benefits. Micromanagement does not helps and non-sense rules. Apply for this job only for few months. Prometric: Start compensating your staff and you will not have so much employee turnover. You operate on your own which is nice Work hours differ depending on how many candidates show up. Very laid back atmosphere. Management is usually available via phone if you have questions. There is also an IT dept. that is very helpful when needed. Management I enjoyed working for Prometric. I had all the support from my management when need. Work schedule was balanced with my life schedule. I would definitely work for Prometric again or refer new staff to the company. I was able to add / gain managerial experience from my upper management through their support and guidance. Great communication between mnagement N/a Very stressful place to work But if you know what you’re doing and pay attention to the training it’ll be some what easy, some of the mangers are very lazy but the coworkers are wonderful productive and welcoming I had alot of fun building my skills as a trainer. they employ people from diverse backgrounds and it was a pleasure being a part of the team. I felt welcomed and included underpaid, overstressed employees from entry level through mid-management Very little concern or effort is given to entry level staff which creates negativity that moves upward through the ranks creating extremely poor service and an unfriendly environment where standard customer service KPI's are nothing more than an afterthought. Upper management is in place simply because they have been there 20+ years, NOT because of experience or intelligence. Nothing Unhappy, underpaid and stressed culture Easy but boring and viciously underpaid Poorly run company (programs freezing all the time, tests crashing, unable to print score reports. Still paying just a couple of bucks over min wage and requiring huge responsibilities. Constant monitoring by video and audio recordings - can be mind-numbingly boring just staring at a screen all day. Went downhill fast Honestly it was easy. We had a full staff. The issue was the staff. The staff began to leave and corporate forced full time on permanents. We were working 10 or even 13 hours a day. Poor pay. Constant tech issue were a problem for test takers and employees. Unfortunately many test takers were forced to reschedule which is very inconsiderate of the company. Corporate knew about this issues. This tech issues existed at every location. Corporate didn’t care how far these people drove. How much time they wasted here. This is very shameful. Corporate is very inconsistent and inconsistent. Our Client Practice or our go by the book is very inconsistent. Great manager. Great co workers Terrible management. Low pay. Long hours. Not a great company While my individual center is great, corporate is a joke. I was made manager around a year in when the previous one quit. Even as a tcm, I make less than a liveable wage. Nobody is going to want to work for that low of pay and I don't blame them. As a result I have only myself and one employee. Corporate doesn't care that I'm so short staffed and frequently tries to make us be open for 10-12 hour days. Tech and operations support are both jokes, as they don't listen and often can't fix anything. The website we are told to refer to is constantly broken. There is no support from corporate or the owner of our location. Interesting people, easy job Low pay, corporate is awful, no support, stressful The actual work is not that difficult Upper management do not have their priority straight. A lot of defects and bugs with our application; however not much resources is to provided to fix them. Dismal pay and no chance for advancement Prometric pays $9 hourly to start. Prometric considers this to be a living wage! A worker might receive a .25 raise after the first year. Employees were payed monthly. This is not the place where employees are valued. The dismal pay coupled with a manger who didn't value employees led to VERY high turnover. Management doesn't care about employees This place has a toxic work environment, no room for advancement, and not competitive with pay. Management doesn't care about employee needs and will deny time off for Drs appointments. Test Center Administrators Poorly Compensated TCAs need better pay. Work is boring, but flexible work life balance for sure. Learned a lot about different tests for different jobs. Pretty chill work culture. Not a good place to work! They tell you one thing and the job calls for something totally different. They can make easy things overbearing. There is no logic in the procedures and they can often be misleading. The interview were a bunch of alternative facts! Coworkers can be helpful. Short breaks, never a clear answer to questions, write ups with no warnings, constant changes in policies and work procedures, more work then pay, controlling by fear, micromanaging, and multiple opinions on how the job should be done. Very routine job. But once you develop your flow, its not bad. There were strict guidelines to the work. There are a number of hostile customers. You just have to explain and follow the procedure. The job does get monotonous at times. But you learn to develop your customer service skills. Not much growth potential. Interesting product A little all over the place but generally a good company. The technology is improving and fun to work with the broad range of clients. Good managers to help. Working at Chicago Prometric was terrible Don’t waste your time the management at the Chicago office was terrible they keep up a lot of confusion they talk about you behind your back and make up lies. One supervisor worked there for 20 years she was the main one. It is not a professional place. They want you to do a lot of work they don’t want to pay it’s always technical problems with the computers. Prometric upper management had no type of i innovation. They and I repeat they do not Value their employees. The place is a revolving door Meeting the candidates Who are taking their test Walking in the door of that place to clock in 3 Productive workplace Enjoyed working for Prometric, if you need help with anything your needs will be addressed quickly. I feel supported at my job. Only downfall is the pay and sometimes the hours. 1 Mentally exhausting but the people can make or break your experience. Turnover rate is high and it's frustrating to constantly teach new employees. Also, your coworkers will make or break your experience. You either love it or hate it. Patience is key because candidates can be difficult, but my manager supported me so I felt confident in my work. Computer skills needed The job itself was a great experience. It’s a chance to meet a variety of people from all walks of life. There was a coworker or two left a bad taste in my mouth. Very unprofessional in attire, attitude, and work ethic. Easy but not compensated properly The job itself, as a proctor, is easy. However, the pay compensation, for the amount of ""security"" you are performing is highly underpaid. Also, the tech support is a complete joke and hassle that you deal with basically on a daily basis. Happy place Very productive work place, their pantry is big, with games, big screen, high bar style table and tool. The overall office is well organised by sections. People are all very friendly, polite and humble from Top level. They have regular get together, celebrating special occasions. They also have task assigned for month awareness. No comment Stress free job, set own hours Love my job working for Prometric. I have been an employee for seven years now. It is a fun, stress free job. You can be flexible with your hours as well. The pay was low for the job and the area so they had a hard time keeping employees Originally this was a great part time job for a retiree. The job was not hard to learn , the site manager would work with you on a schedule and one got to meet a range of different people every day. But as the job market became tighter the company did not respond to the growing wage market so they had a hard time keeping or finding employees due to their low pay scale. Soon after being hired there were only 2 employees left, the manager and myself. The daily hours got longer, sometimes we were working 10-11 hour days., 4-5days a week! Corporate management was horrible to work with and provided no support at all for the site. Their solution was to have us hire temps as replacements for employees at a higher price range than even the manager was making but the temps would not show up. Eventually the manager even quit. A month later after working full time hours, acting as the site manager and training the frequent temporaries , I was still getting the pay of a part time employee, so I also quit. It was obvious that they don't value their employees very well. It was not really a stressful job and had decent benefits for a PART TIME position, Great for retirees! Low pay for full time employees and site managers, No support for site offices from corporate or regional managers, Outdated and low quality equipment at testing sites Not A place to make your career Job was okay for what it was but it's no room for growth or a raise. They will use you up and when you ask about a raise or room for advancement they will give you the run around. And not to mention being a contract employee with no paid holidays or any kind of benefits. It's some good people people in mangement but they overworked and overlooked too! That's why the turnover rate so high! And the pay is wayyyy below average! Nothing!!! Pay No paid holidays if you a contract employee and no room for advancement and no raises. Manager is sincere and caring. Very fair and he’s considerate. A lot of intricate things to remember about each test. Always on cameras. Not much time to even grab a sip of water. Can be extremely stressful, low pay for what you do. Great manager Boring and stressful Prometric is one of the worst companies I have ever worked for. They do not post positions in time for internal candidates to apply. For their top positions, they always hire from the outside which leaves no room for advancement. Prometric always tries to eat more than it can chew at once. Thus employees are expected to bleed if necessary to get things done. To stay up to date with the workload, you need to invest at least 16 hours. If you cannot because of family or other commitments, you are not viewed in a good light by management. Long days, Abrasive treatment of employees by management, no follow up from HR when formal complaints are submitted, no room for advancement, create new titles/roles to demote employees without their knowledge. Fun place work but does get hectic Great place to work just make sure your great at multitasking and a quick learner it’s really fast paced and busy but other that it’s relaxed once the rush cools down Great perdiem job Great job for a nurse looking for perdiem work, you can work the days that are best for you, you have autonomy, great support and travel opportunities. You can do your paperwork at home and you are reimbursed for your time and resources. It is an high quality company with a high standard of excellence. Job description, supervisor Pay, computer process can be challenging Great management and work life balance. Prometric is a very good company. The have sites across the US. They also have very high standards for a testing company. Pay is decent for what job entails. You are never left without help. Your supervisor and IT are always s available. When your finished at the site, you are finished for the day. Travel involved I really enjoy my time at Prometric. A lot of changes in upper management but I have had a good experience with Prometric. Underpaid TCAs make it hard to find staff but otherwise a great place to work. Schedule flexible, management great Not paid enough to maintain a staff long term In and out type job It's a good part time job while in college, or working other jobs on the side. Easy work, low stress work but not exciting for fulfilling necessarily low stress, easy labor boring, unable to do to other stuff while candidates test Under New Management This location has now been taken back corporately and Prometric is looking for new team members. There are full time and part time positions available. easy job It's long hours of just sitting and watching people rake their exams. It is an easy job but it can get boring really fast. Management is terrible at this location. easy boring Routine Job with small yet annoying irregularities This is pretty much one of the easiest jobs I’ve worked. The job is pretty much self explanatory after training and easy to get help if need be. Management is great. You definitely have your good and bad days like any other job but for the most part its a fair deal. Easy Work Can get boring Underpaid The work we did for our candidates was fulfilling. Employees are underpaid compared to other local call centers. Management was often toxic and passive aggressive. Nice facility Management during my tenure was terrible. Interesting product A little all over the place but generally a good company. The technology is improving and fun to work with the broad range of clients. Good managers to help. Training is thorough. I was a temp working for Prometric. Great hours, good training but i had to catch 3 buses to get there. Potential to go permanent but if you owe the irs or have any felonies you will not be hired permanently. Training, good coworkers Location 7 1 Fun place to work part time Great place to work part time. The pay is pretty low but if you’re young with not a lot of responsibilities it can work. The secret shops can make or break your location 2 You'd might as well work at an asylum! Immediately, there is no promotions or advances based on seniority or experience. This is strictly a place that functions off of favorability and how much of someone else's job you can cover. In 2 1/2 years, I was assigned up to 8 different supervisors (most quit, switched departments or excelled to other positions). Human Resources quit just before we furloughed due to Covid-19 and after returning, I had to reach out to HR from another location for two weeks straight just to be added back onto the payroll. It's still going downhill. From the SR VP on down, everyone is just too entitled to band together for a greater cause! No dress code Everyone knows Everything, no incentives, visitors from the other offices don't like to wear their masks indoors A stepping stone It was not a bad place to work but pretty boring.… Checking people in and out, monitoring tests and clean up at the end of the shift it’s about the extent of the job. Work was easy, coworkers friendly Very sedentary, boring job. No opportunity for advancement. Horrible No room for growth. High turnover rate. Very poor salary. Outdated tech, I mean I use a laptop from like 10 years ago. The management was ok for my particular department. I liked my manager. But that was the only thing I liked about working here PTO I guess Everything haha Micromanaged and exhausting I was a Test Center Manager for 5 years and it was not a pleasant experience. The work they expect you to get done with the amount of staff they allow you to have scheduled is unrealistic. There is minimal work/life balance - if you have not incurred any vacation time then you will be denied any time off request even if it’s only one day. I was micromanaged to the extreme. They continue to try to raise their security standards and yet continue to schedule bare minimal staff. My employees were burnt out as was I. Try to steer clear of this company. Breaks & Lunch were above average compared to other companies Salary was below average given the amount of responsibilities, expensive benefits, no option of unpaid time off Busy paced Cool place to work at. But can be busy working at the call center. Some days could be slow while others very fast paced. Must have good customer service skills in order to do this job well. Benefits, other employee perks Busy days Boring low pay This was one of the worst jobs I ever had. The only saving grace was the co-workers. Low pay and no hours. It didn't even pay to drive to the job. You just sit there and watch people on video taking a test. Occasionally you get up and do a walk Thu. It was so boring. Coworkers Everything else A simple yet rewarding job Working there was rewarding for me. The staff and manager were very helpful and supportive, and proctoring was the best part of the job. However, you might need an extra source of income since hours can be cut down due to how many candidates are scheduled on certain days or what days your site is open. Good pay, fun and easy Might get less hours Overall good part-time job Even though people probably come into this job thinking they will just sit and do nothing, it actually is a lot of tedious work you need to do. With that being said, my manager (Bethesda,MD) was kind to me and was always respectful. Due to the customer service aspect of this job, it can get stressful but the work itself was manageable. It is not labor intensive though it can require you to be focused in a boring environment. There is little to no advancement. Most people are working here as a part-time job while in college or people who want few hours. Relatively stagnant job with some high stress moments. Prometric is a great testing company, but it’s boring to work for. You check people in and out of their tests, do security checks, sign them in an out for restroom breaks, walk through the testing area to make sure there is no cheating, and the rest of the time you sit at a desk and watch people test. I doubt there is a more boring job. You can’t read, color, draw, be on your phone, or anything else while monitoring the testers. It’s a job that doesn’t change very much day to day so that’s a plus, but there are some high stress moments when you forget to do something, the testers don’t listen and you end up in trouble, or when Prometric pays people to come and try and catch you not doing your job well. Consistent work duties. Boring, short breaks. Ok company to work for. Good company to start a career. They promote from within so there are chances to work your way up. They value the most customer service and attention to detail. Exciting and room to improve yourself I worked in a company for 18 years and then moved into a company to become an I.T field technician first company was a terrible place to work 2nd company was better but lacked training and salary options, Moving to Prometric was an amazing opportunity that I jumped on when a recruiter asked me would i be interested in going for an interview . The interview was focused on me as a person rather than my qualifications which is a great way to do an interview as you want the person more than the qualifications I believe ,the interview process was friendly informative , told me about what they do asked me a lot of good questions about me as a person how I manage people and changes and conflicts was a very healthy and informative interview and I came away from it happy and felt it was great interaction. Great Salary, opportunity to move up, travel and exciting new places to visit. Global interaction from all over the world, great management team who are consistently promoting good core values and peoples mind and health . none It's a job, not a career It's a P/T job, even if a person requests more hours. Schedule and hours are inconsistent. Schedule can include evenings, weekends, and holidays. It's nearly impossible to take time off. Manager is erratic. Pay better than minimum wage Frequently too busy to take breaks, time off requests denied Poor Management & Job Culture Pros +Exposure to the assessment industry Cons -Commercial organization ran by people totally out of touch with the industry, all about bottom-line/revenue, and does not recognize internal staff -Over worked and under compensated -Rarely promotes within -If promoted, the rate is 3% pay increase Do your research before entering this company. If you search around LinkedIn, you will notice many employees leave this organization for another inside the assessment industry. This is not by chance - Prometric is a poor company to work for. They expect you to over work, with nothing in return. Assessment Industry Read Review, Low Salary, Over Worked, No Promotions Test Center Manager I was with the company for 3 years. No room for advancement. They work you to the bone. Pay and hours are bad. Went from working a steady Monday through Saturday to working Mondays, Tuesdays, Friday's. Raises were bare minimum and I mean barely 30cents for flawless execution of job even though the minimum wage was steadily rising. At a certain point TCAs and TCMs will probably be paid the same. Healthcare Aggressively underpaid, no steady pay check, no room for advancing, no support, lack of training Test center Market driven testing schedule, so hours fluctuated. So full time work wasn't always full time hours. Staffing shortages that took a long time to fill. office environment staffing shortages dysfunctional company on a path to the bottom You'll spend most of your time putting out fires for a company that refuses to invest in itself. Prometric's business strategy is to try and gain clients faster than they lose them while never addressing the root of their problems. Tolerable if you just need a job. People do not tend to stay long so not much community/culture. Low standards so you can get away with the bare minimum Below average pay, drama, no growth so no opportunity for advancement Great company with limited hours This is a great company but I would not recommend it for anyone looking for steady full time hours. As a office manager I am responsible for ensuring all rules&regulations are being followed at the test center. The hours are based off of operational needs so some days you may only work four hours. Also the test center is only open three days a week Ability to manage freely Limited hours Poor Management Very few hours, sometimes 1day a month, hours not fairly distributed, don’t waste your time. This was a franchise so the owners were never present and took very little interest in day to day operations. Easy Boring, can’t leave area, no hours Interesting product A little all over the place but generally a good company. The technology is improving and fun to work with the broad range of clients. Good managers to help. People look down on you Good entry level job, however no room to grow whatsoever. Deal with the biggest D-bag people I have ever seen that think they are better than everyone else on a day to day basis. After rush is over there is a sense of nothing to do. 1 Co-Workers are amazing but management plays favorites & lies constantly My supervisor and team was amazing but higher management is awful. They replaced almost all the supervisors with new ones and expected us the employees to teach them the ropes! They get your hopes up about opportunities to advance in the company but it’s all lies. They just promote the same people. My coworkers were the only thing that got me through my days there. Catering Events, Amazing Co-Workers Poor Management, Plays Favorites 9 Good products Company has good vision for future however technology is not keeping up with current trends which causes more work for staff and frustration for candidates. Outdated technology and poor mgmt alignment with mission and all depts Severely underpaid & NO ORGANIZATION Worked for over a year. MORALE IN THE OFFICE IS TERRIBLE!! Extremely underpaid, little to no room for growth, managers barely know what’s going on, people leave early & come late whenever they want(favoritism) & HR is absolutely the worse! DO NOT WORK IN NURSE AIDE!! Seems nice at first but believe me IT IS NOT! This place is a JOKE. Everyone there is depressed & no one higher up cares. None, only here because it’s close to home! Perfect Job For Someone that needs Flexibility Great place to interact with individuals who are taking the next step in their careers.Flexible Schedule. Great for someone who is retired or just looking for a part time job. Meeting New People Technology Issues Trash Don't do it reconsider! The first day the orientation class was left in the conference room for HOURS without any direction other than the facilitator will be back. The second day we were sent to our desks and told to read the company website for HOURS with no further direction. Finally get to training and the trainer literally says don't do this if you can find another job do so. Fast forward through training we get on the floor the first week everyone got fired for being on their personal phones and then it was like the wild wild west there was no one in the center no one to help just empty. The calls came in nonstop and it's calls you didn't learn about in training but you are told you handle them. They basically set you up to fail, the system is slow and raggedy your co workers aren't friendly and rightfully so this is the most stressful unorganized organization I've ever dealt with I hated every moment of it it's so much more but you get the idea No one paid any attention to you No one paid any attention to you Upper management is clueless, people are not valued Company gives lip service to quality, but corners are constantly being cut. People are not valued. Colleagues were furloughed during pandemic, and the work was piled on the rest of us while we took pay cuts. There are multiple issues with the software. Stay away. Colleagues Salary cuts, too much work piled on staff, people leaving in droves Company culture is a practice of confusion, instability, exclusion and hypocrisy Typical work day: we assist and test a variety of candidates in all walks of work life. The Onsite level employees have developed an atmosphere of support which is not reciprocated from higher ups. I have learned what my management style is and that operating in inclusion for Prometric means profit first always and employees last constantly. Management varies from departments but overall Prometric does NOT utilize communication or respect amongst the company departments. There is no work life balance due to ineffective scheduling practice and NO support nor respect from scheduling department for management. There are no advancement opportunities with this company. Self preservation is a challenge and acknowledgement is scarce. Benefits Company Culture, lack of communication, no advancement opportunity Easy work but unfair pay Paid too little and management does not support workers in any capacity. Could be a great place to work if hours were more consistent and management took the time to acknowledge employees performance. Laid back environment Little to no breaks. Worst place to work I worked for this company in 2012. The people I worked with at the testing center were great. Upper management was the worst. They do not care about their employees and are more concerned about their bottom line. Easy job Everything else Not for long term work The work is inconsistent. Events can be canceled up to the night before, or you might drive an hour for two candidates. You will not get a raise. Period. Good work for someone looking for spending money. Driving is expected. Work alone, clean work environment. Very inconsistent. Do not depend on this for income. Great place to work as a second job This job was perfect for a second job - the pay is not great if this is your only job, but being able to have a flexible schedule to work around school, another job etc. made it a great choice for some extra income. It's not a difficult job, and I really liked that it's pretty much 50% desk job and 50% on your feet. no raise for 15+ years The only reason I stayed at this job for 18 years was that I could schedule testing days to work around my kids' schedule. My immediate supervisor made the job tolerable and kept corporate from hounding us. There were about 6-8 of us that worked in the state of Arkansas. We worked together as a team to cover one another's test days. Prometric as a company lacked alot. Management was always changing and everybody that came in thought they knew how to do it better. We did not receive raises for 15+ years. Never even a Christmas card. My supervisor asked if she could buy planners for us and was told no. Worked alone with supervision No recognition for good work, no raises Flexibility Great place to work at and get to have days off where I can be able to be at home with family, use for appts and other activities needed to bee done. Productive and fun work place Loved my manager and staff. Very inviting and family type atmosphere. Busy but fun while meeting new people. Love the incentives given for good observation report. Getting bonuses for good observation report. Sometimes no lunch break. Not a reliable employer. Not recommended as a primary employment. I was very excited to work for this company. The pay was truly competitive and I have enjoyed collaborating with the team. However, I had been really disappointed as they do not offer enough hours thus, one could not survive with the very little that is made from this company. Unfortunately, after collaborating for several months, the company never contacted me for further projects. Excellent team work. Great projects. Company representatives not professional enough, Never contacted as to why I was not offered other assignments. Fulfilling work but little room for growth This was one of the more relaxed jobs I've had. Really loved the people I worked with and I appreciated the wonderful management team and owner. Most of the time you are just watching over the candidates on a grid of cameras for any signs of cheating, and to assist any of them with various needs. There are chaotic and stressful periods where you are assisting dozens of candidates at once, and it can get quite tense when there are technical issues that don't get resolved immediately, but most of the time the off-site Helpdesk support is very quick to get things working with minimal downtime. As far as job duties go it can get a bit boring sometimes to be honest. I learned most of what I would be doing in the first few weeks (which felt like a lot and was confusing at the time; though your experience here may vary depending on how they go about the training process and who does it). After that it was autopilot other than updating some of the test procedures occasionally. Overall I felt like I was doing something important and it was nice seeing candidates pass their test and further their careers. Many of them are extremely grateful to the staff, but we did deal with a Karen or two on occasion. Main drawback is the inconsistent hours from month to month and little room for growth considering there are only a few positions. The office I was at had the same managing team for decades so i assume it paid decently in those positions but I don't know for sure. The entry level position I was in paid slightly higher than min wage and provided only one very small raise in the year Fulfilling, relaxed work and laid back atmospheremost of the time Little room for growth, somewhat low pay Pay is horrible and mangement is new and uneducated This place wants to work you to death but offer you so little outdated equipment and software to work with, top boss freely Express hes not upgrading... guess he use it for his many extravagant cars... the place is pretty clean though mostly new management who dont know much but think they kno everything Upper Management is Inconsistent and Uncaring The organization furloughed many employees due to Covid. That was to be expected but they were uncaring and insensitive in the delivery of the message. Upper leadership does not speak to or acknowledge us regular agents. Work hours and location VPs and Sr Management. Poor culture. No opportunity for growth from phones Terrible Don't know how anyone works here. Its awful. Management doesn't care. No work life balance. Only thing worth coming to work for is the fact that everyone hates it, so we're all in it together. Interesting product A little all over the place but generally a good company. The technology is improving and fun to work with the broad range of clients. Good managers to help. Education advancement while working there Work-life balance Work-life balance at Prometric is encouraging and rewarding. Pay & benefits My pay and benefits at Prometric was not much no Benefits was offered. Job security and advancement In terms of job security at Prometric, I think it is a company where you can advance your career easily. Management In general, managers at Prometric are very helpful and respectful. Culture Collaboration with my colleagues at Prometric was Fabulous. I met very nice people there. Overall My experience working at Prometric overall was Excellent because i was discovering how other company function and also how to implement or incorporate Prometric services in other Company to help their employees enhance their skills and knowledge. 1 1 Miserable work place The supervisor is miserable and a few of the employees. There’s no room for acceleration and the company don’t have enough money to give a pay raise. The supervisor makes up her own rules and doesn’t follow the handbook. It closes at 8 . Most times earlier Healthcare horrible, no incentives. Great job for rule followers I enjoy going to work. The 8 days of hands-on training is great and sets you up for success. When someone has an issue with a candidate all staff are made aware of it so we all learn from the situation. If we succeed it is because we are a team. If one of us fails a secret shopper our site fails. I was told we can all forget things or miss things but it is everyone’s job to remind each other of what was missed. We do so respectfully and everyone at my work site is respectful whether you are the newest or most senior person on staff. Great place with great people. Great coworkers Only part- time The only problem was to ignore when things contrary to the law and The company’s rules. I enjoyed working at this company but could not continue to wok there while certain rules were enforced and others not. When this system became personal in which I was called a *F by a memeber of the night staff the district manager said He did not interfere with fights between the staff. Good people apply to work there. Good company with good benefits. Having the management apply some rules very strictly but others not at all. It all depends on your manager I had a great manager who knew how to lead/teach without being overly pushy. He was one of the best managers I’ve had in a job to date. He trusted his staff to keep things running smoothly in his absence and in the event that anything did go wrong, he was only a phone call away with solutions. Sometimes the equipment would malfunction and it can’t always be avoided but contacting tech support could be time consuming and useless. Vital numbers for assistance would often not be open on Saturdays which was a prime date for testing and that would be extremely frustrating to both the staff and the test candidates. Overall, this a great job especially if you are fresh of school or looking to get back into the workforce. The training can be overwhelming at first but once you learn a lot of the basics, it gets way easier. Great benefits for full-time, Can be a small team to work with, you learn a lot about different industries by interacting with the test-takers Often inconsistent schedule, Unreliable tech support system, Not many opportunities to advance, Sometimes long work days Enjoyed working here Former employee, loved working here as a Nurse aide evaluator. Decent pay, fairly easy work. Inconsistent work at times and some at home work is required but isnt overwhelming. workload evil straight up evil company. whenever you call to get help with rescheduling an exam, no one will answer for over an hour and they will hang up. i'm told that they're busy helping other callers but i suspect that is a lie. Long and boring ● Pay & benefits My pay is low and benefits at Prometric are ok ● Management In general, managers at Prometric Rude ● Overall My experience working at Prometric It was ok at first then it went down hill. Great Team Terrible Leadership One of the easiest jobs on the planet. Management would want you to work40 hours a weeks and only part time benefits. The process to check people in was redundant and time consuming. It was always someone telling you you did something wrong, but they would never do it correctly. Just a negative 👎🏾 job, that leaders want you to be robots and not humans. Hours of operation Changing every day Productive workplace You get whatever you put into the job. If you apply your self its easy to get promoted, if you come in doing the bare minimum then you will be treated as such. Great Atmosphere, Very Little Room for Growth The job overall was a great place to work. Yet, there was little room for growth, and most job openings went to someone outside of the facility than internally. Management was great, and co-workers were pleasant. It could be stressful at times, due to dealing with testers anxieties and impatience, but overall the job itself was decent. Independence, Quiet Very little growth opportunity, Job life balance was not very good Prometric This job does not value their employees. They make employees do much work with little pay. I was an employee and Prometric for almost two years, did a great job, even made a trainer but no incentive. I made structure for the training program there and templates and never got recognition. They don’t care about you at this job. Productive and reliable place to work in. My favorite part of the job was being able to help keep testing candidates calm before they took their tests. The work environment was calm which allowed for a great job experience. A very pleasant place to work. This job is not stressful at all. You get to work with friendly people all day long including the candidates who come in for testing each day. The job consists of preparing the test center in order to be ready for testing, greeting candidates and informing them of the rules specified for their test, maintaining a secure and comfortable testing environment, practicing cleaning and filing procedures and answering phone calls as well as performing courtesy reminder calls. There are two Test Center Administrators at the test center at all times. We alternate switching on the hour between the back room and front desk. The culture here is great. You never come to work expecting a bad day and never leave work stressed or in a bad mood. The hardest part about the job I would say is the initial learning process. There are a lot of things to learn, especially little things, but as soon as you get the feel for the job and find your flow, the days go very smoothly. Prometric is located in a very nice up to date building located just into West Fargo off of 13th Ave. Overall, a very pleasant place to work. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable part-time job. Hours are 7-5ish (depends on how quickly candidates finish testing), 7-12 or 12-5ish. Friendly environment, Down time, Relaxed, Daytime hours, Get to dress nice, Front desk job/proctor, Peaceful, Always closed on Sundays No healthcare/benefits Prometric Favorite job I’ve had. Would still be there if I didn’t have to move. Calming environment with some decent people. It’s a very by the book job so it’s fairly easy as well. The upper management has no regard for any employee. Upper management sucks. No real benefits Crazy expensive insurance Expect you to continue working off the clock. No regard for human life. Force you to come in on icy roads etc. Poor Management. This Company is poorly ran by top management, totally disconnected to the test centers. No room for advancement, send in secret testers just to lower the test center score. Not a good place to work Long Hours, No overtime, Distribution Center lacks discipline to deliver testing materials on time, or in the correct box as intended, paperwork never matches what they say it does, Scanning of exams always have issues, obviously the management team is lazy to spot check items being sent out, if you're not working for the candidate experience then why screw them over with lazy customer service, in my opinion the logistics team should all be fired due to being incompetent. None Working for PROMETRIC People-centric There is a culture of respect and kindness at Prometric. There are many training opportunities and an understanding of the significant learning curve necessary to master the job responsibilities. Awefull company to work for! You will constantly get blamed for errors made by someone else. You are constantly under audio and video surveillance by people who have never worked at a field site location and citisiece your every move. Test takers are extremely rude and demanding and will blame you if they don't do well on their test. You will work long hours one week and little to no hours the following. Extremely inconsistent hours, rules and treatment of employees. They don't give raises because nobody works there long enough to get one. This site has over 100% turnover in employees every year."

Turnover of employees is minimal, working with good people is always a plus, working job sites are kept safe and clean, growing company that hires those that want to work Bad management They lie, they steal, and are an embarrassment to all contractors. Their Forman is hated among everyone in the union. No journeyman.Overall a big joke Waldinger Very negative work place. Training was nonexistent. One employee was condescending and belittling to almost everyone in our department. My first week I was told that no one in the department was able to do anything right and was told negative comments about almost everyone in the department. Worst environment I have ever worked in. Good and responsible work for improving local matters. I enjoyed that managemenr gave me the privellage to work under various projects that fit my wide area of job skills. They are a good company to work for. Great job security Great group of technicians office personel I worked at The Waldinger Corporation in St Louis for 18 years as an HVAC Service Technician. Over the years I was able to expand the equipment I worked on, which I truly enjoyed. Management was very reasonable overall and made the workplace culture pleasant.

Great company Waldinger is a great company to work for if you're interested in going in the trades, from what i hear but never experienced was lay-offs can be quite frequent. Fun employees to work with Bosses can be very strict 1 Good work atmosphere Great place to work , lots of opportunities to adavance. Great benefits good training and support for new employees . Company supports local trades and services The co workers were nice people The call center is managed poorly and there is favoritism and discrimination happening on a daily basis! Chaos and little training for new hires and the manager yells a lot when frustrated. Manager very catty and inexperienced People you work with Manager, schedule, inconsistent, lack of training Moderately fast paced. Cut throat. The work isn’t that bad. Management is the issue. You can do good work. But that won’t stop them from laying you off. Terrible communication. You’re left in the dark about everything. Great workers lack of work I worked at waldinger for a year was known to be one of the best non apprentice workers passed all my tests and was then laid off so I will not be reapplying to this job Great family-owned place to work Waldinger cares about their employees and especially develops/rewards those that are loyal and hardworking. There is a reason that overall turnover is low and average tenure is high. work environment Field co workers are my best friends so it makes it the best environment. We always work together as a team. if we have any issues with each other we handle it on site and not complain to higher ups. Busy The company kept me busy and I enjoyed my job. There were great people, worked with a wide variety of different personalities but with correct adaptation and motivation is was manageable Very good company to work for. Good company to work for. Management in the Tampa, Fl branch is top notch. Hours can be long but typical for the trade. Company offers good training opportunities. Good place. They treated me fair Management was good. Can be hard work though. Different job. Never boring. You could find yourself in the extreme heat or the frigid cold. One has to be used to dealing with these temps. Competitive workplace, and great place to start our as a serviceman Typical work day included changing filters, and maintaining a preventative maintenance datasheet for each piece of equipment being worked on. Would drive to customer that had service work to be done, check in with customer on iPad and have them review finished product after I was done completing the PREV tr active maintenance on specific pieces of equipment. Very smart boss Very fast paced, could be stressful at times. Old Company Values Good company to start at for young people. Lots of mentoring. Team effort on job site. A respectable company with old core values. Very friendly management and easy to work with. Great people to work with Pay could be better Cut throat at heart. The Waldinger Corporation says they welcome input from field technicians and mid level managers but when the input is given, upper management receives it as negative criticism regardless how the input is delivered.The work/life balance as a senior technician and mid level manager is terrible. The mid level managers are typically left with the weight of the company on their shoulder while The branch managers disappear to God knows where for God knows how long while they roll your calls VM and return to criticize how you handled the situations that came up while they were gallivanting around. The branch managers report to regional managers who do not communicate directly to mid level managers. This presents a huge gap for the branch managers to do whatever they please while leaning on mid level managers the be the ""fall guy."" Technicians are often overworked and underpaid. TWC exploits the national bargaining agreement with the unions to and pay what should be Journeyman technicians as a Tradesman. None Everything Accountant (former employee) Waldinger is a great company to work for and the co-workers are great to work with. The benefits are great. My supervisor was great to work with was always there when I need him and always had my back. poor I was lied to since day one but chose to ignore it. I was promised all the advancements but seen none no matter what I did to correct anything failed. Productive Knowledgeable company, I really like The Waldinger Corporation. The company is big on safety and provides you the tools and the training to you need to do your job efficiently. There has been a lot of changes at Waldinger and can be hard to keep up. Great company to work for. Great staff and upper management is top notch. If you have the drive and talent, this company can get your career going full blast. The culture is great. They are a family first type of company that really means it. As with any job, you get out what you put in and I have been very well taken care of here. Top notch employee support Not a good fit Was lead to believe that accounting functions would be part of the position. After six months I was informed that my job title had changed form accounting clerk to billing coordinator. Productive and fun place to work Nice place to work. Good environment.

Their Forman is hated among everyone in the union. No journeyman.Overall a big joke Waldinger Very negative work place. Training was nonexistent. One employee was condescending and belittling to almost everyone in our department. My first week I was told that no one in the department was able to do anything right and was told negative comments about almost everyone in the department. Worst environment I have ever worked in. Good and responsible work for improving local matters. I enjoyed that managemenr gave me the privellage to work under various projects that fit my wide area of job skills. They are a good company to work for. Great job security Great group of technicians office personel I worked at The Waldinger Corporation in St Louis for 18 years as an HVAC Service Technician. Over the years I was able to expand the equipment I worked on, which I truly enjoyed. Management was very reasonable overall and made the workplace culture pleasant. Don’t do it You are a number management could care less about you. Hard to get proper tools. Would work you to death and talk about you behind your back. Could care less about personal life Great place to start your accounting career Waldinger is a great place to gain experience in the accounting field. Each area is very specific and you can gain a lot of experience in each area individually. If you like variety, you may get bored. Nice coworkers, good pay, flexibility in hours Each position is dedicated to a specific task, not a lot of variety, and easy to get bored when ran out of work. 1 Politics and back stabbing techs doing half way repairs or rigging instead of fixing it right It is run like a group of 5 year olds are in charge no one has a clue as to what is going on you do not know if or when you are going to work So you babysit a phone 24/7 None Hostile environment Avoid bad management tactics Just avoid. Poor culture, poor communication, poor management. To much time spent worrying about how much money the company is making, not enough focus on taking care of the customer base. Leaving the was the biggest pro! Lack of work lack of support no communication Good place to work It’s a good place to work when there is work. It’s a union shop so the pay is good. You can’t beat the work hours. There’s some good guys there and there’s some not so good guys there. Excellent Company with Enviable Reputation In this climate of open jobs everywhere, I feel happy and satisfied with my choice of employers. There is a sense of teamwork and purpose in daily work. Autonomy with support Stay away Just stay away. Seriously they have terrible management, oh and a lack of enough hours to go around and will jot trim anyone to meet the workload. Run away. Learned a lot Seriously everything. Decent work with ok pay Most people will stab you in the back when time gets slow so stay in your own lane a few people there are really good to work for but there is more cry baby’s and whiners than any other place I’ve worked plus on the sheet metal side most of your money is in your benifits not much goes on the check Benifits Every one that works there Great Culture Too many to list! This company is people-centric with clear goals for current year and next 5 years. EVERYONE is friendly and caring. The business is structured so individuals are recognized for their efforts. The work-life balance here is better than I ever could have imagined. Profit-Sharing pools Stay away Management are no help. No experience in the industry long hours one week than none the next. They are a Union company and talk bad about the union behind there backs. Never will I have a good word to say about this company and it's owner or GM. None Everyday Management Management is realistic. Office personnel in Lavista We’re always effective in helping out To get the job complete. Good techs with a A wide range of knowledge Successful company and promoted from within Work-life balance This is a wonderful company to work for! It is family oriented and the people are great to work with! Pay & benefits 401k and medical benefits are great! Job security and advancement If you work hard and are a team player you with thrive at this company! Overall I would still work there had I not relocated. The management had my best interest in mind and was always open to listening to my ideas about improving or becoming more efficient Poor management This company can’t keep customers and the management mistreats its employees verbally and mentally , we have a constant turn over. There have been serval instances with several employees where management has yelled and belittled employees . I’m a man and they have actually belittled women for thier work. Good pay Poor management Hvac service tech the upper management will lie to you, you can not trust a word they say. They told me they had all this work and they did not lay people off. I was a senior tech and I was going behind the younger techs and fixing there mistakes and they worked me all summer and the layed me and a friend of mine off at the same time. If you want to work for a place that will do you dirty the waldinger is the place to go. Fast paced and exciting Very fast paced. Technicians are great to work with. The owners of the company are very family oriented people. I enjoyed working with my co-workers. Investing in our future They are building a massive new HQ building that will be a great place work with my friends. Seems like we are adding new locaitons every other month, I have so many places I could work In it for the long run great place to work!

Hewlett Packard Enterprise|" Great place to work Great place to work, never doing the same job over and over again. Traveling all over PA and WV meeting new customers and installing new equipment on a daily basis 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Organization Culture! What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Company course requirements. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Very good. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Busy. Very good. Worked here 11 years HPE is a great place to work with a great staff. They are quick to promote from within and almost always try to accommodate the employees. I started out in technical support and moved into non-technical areas and was always offered support. While there, I was underpaid as a female but they fixed that issue by giving me a 25% raise to get me up to par with the males. I was let go but if you get the chance, this is a great place. fair, committed to helping everyone reach their potential; great benefits and time off policy they fixed the biggest problem I had with pay disparities so its a non-issue Great job and environment Pay was great. Management will give you the training needed to succeed as well as introduce you to the right people. They do a good job of de-stressing you with activities. Lots of paid time off!! Nice people, bad career track The position I held at HPE was a low skill position, and did not feel like there was a lot of room for advancement. On the other hand, the people I worked with were nice and the environment was very laid back. No es una mala empresa Overall good, though not perfect. The organization had a very well managed method of service delivery Good Workplace, no pressure/stress, easy going Standup meeting in morning Lot of tech stack to learn Fair Management/people work life balance is good no pressure/stress teams have tough people to manage with ( i think every company's teams like this) No stress/pressure projects might be boring sometimes Good company with good benefits Good company with good benefits. It can be challenging working with different people but overall if you’re looking for work it’s a good place to work. Good place to work Started in 1997. Not a lot of room for growth. My boss was good to work for. He treated me well and was fair. Might have been the best boss I ever had. Great Work/Life Balance The Company cares about its employees and takes initiatives to keep people happy. HPE offers 6 months of paid family leave for mothers and fathers. Often a slow-paced atmosphere. Benefits, Work from home, Family Leave Not much opportunity for advancement Great company to work for Great company to work for. Allows room for growth and education. Culture is evolving in a positive direction. Expect change so it will be a non issue when it happens. Good experience and resume builder Working contract at HPE provided a supportive learning environment on a project with good exposure to different sectors of the business. There's a presence of the bureaucracy of large corp, but the separation of the assignment protects your anonymity in the politics. Healthy culture Healthy working environment in Sillicon Valley heritage company - not many career advancements for younger employees, very senior teams Reelvant company strategy Benefits, ok salary senior teams, not much focus put on enabling and training managers Good company but very slow growth Overall good company but career growth opportunities limited. company is got focused after Antonio Neri is become the CEO. But the company culture is still slow. Professional, inclusive, intelligent environment While retired now, this was the brightest, greatest team to work with in my entire 40 year career. Focus on culture. Focus on diversity. Focus on challenging its employees. Compensation, Work/Life Balance, Challenging tasks. Market did not apprectiate the significance of all that HPE delivered. Work, Benefits, culture, Work is good. Precedure all is available in the system. Training depending who tech you and you get smart to learn for all people and the different people. All you need your notes. Name, date, shift, hour no matter who. Benefits for company good pay for hires, .but the company changed for staffing and the staffing paying low and the company don't hire the employees. ok ok, growing, good people, good pay, nothing else to say, poor job security, not as good as the ""old"" hp use to be, moving into artificial intelligence. good people job security No complaints That job taught me a lot. I gained a lot of knowledge along the way. To this day, I have coworkers that became friends. Although there were a lot of ups and downs, the good out weighs the bad. Management is iffy. You have to be ready for constant changes. 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? The very professional dynamic of employees in a fantastic environment What is the most stressful part about working at the company? I can’t recall anything really stressful besides one manager that I did not care for who I worked under. Hewlett Packard was a great company HP respects their employees and treats them fairly. I had a fantastic manager. Unfortunately, my division was sold to Micro Focus. When that happened, things went downhill fast and their culture was the opposite. I would recommend working for HP if a job is offered. Great Work Life Balance, Bad Business Direction The work life balance is great. Salary is low compared to competitors. Business direction is poor, as I feel they are just trying to stay afloat. One executive compared the company to blockbuster. Every quarter/year their are layoffs. A lot of great Talent moved to competitor companies within a year. Great place to work Great place to work, never doing the same job over and over again. Traveling all over PA and WV meeting new customers and installing new equipment on a daily basis Corporate America You are a cog in a wheel. If you have a great manager awesome but you probably won't meet anyone above them. Huge corporation that knows nothing about the lower level employees. Fond memories but would not go back I worked at HP for 11 years. My worklife balance was decent. I was able to volunteer with non-profits in a way that I could never do today. But the groups I worked in were slow to adopt new technologies and I was concerned that I'd never be able to get a job anywhere else working on dinosaur tech at HP. So, I left and never looked back. My colleagues were fantastic. I have fond memories, but I wouldn't go back unless I was truly desperate. Even then, I probably wouldn't go back. 3 stars What is the best part of working at the company? No one really monitors you What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Meeting the sales expectations Not much advancement opportunities Work you to the bone and no training investment in employees. Manager have favorites. Coworkers are nice and office is nice. Men are advanced much more than women. Some flex work schedule Pay, no career advancement or training opportunities. Politic plays a major role in what happens Lack of transparency in terms of company objective and goals. Many times different departments work at cross purpose to one another. CYA seems to be the approach to responsibility Excellent Work Environment The job expectations were clear. Team leads and supervisors were supportive and did a wonderful job explaining and communicating performance goals expectations. Healthcare Salary is mediocre. Management does not provide good direction. Compensation is pretty bad. Great team makes the difference. Company provide internal resources to learn but they are not up to date. The people aren’t bad but there is little to no support from others or management. Besides the lack of support, advancements are rare. Job security is non-existent. Every quarter there are lay-offs and annual reviews are based on grade quotas, not merit. Pay can be a little low in the industry and raises are also very low, if at all. Many of the people and a few of the mid-management are great. See above Great benefits and pay but difficult to advance in career I consider the Human Resources upper management top notch as the company provides very good benefits and shows appreciation for their employees. In engineering, the projects are challenging and industry leading. Job security is low and career advancement is very difficult. Projects are cancelled and work groups reorganized often. People are transferred to new positions based on past experience, not career aspirations. In some cases, people advance to a desired position only to have the position taken away when they are reassigned to a new work group. They end up starting over and doing what they used to do in their previous position. Holidays, vacation, pay, work-environment options (office, remote, hybrid), challenging projects, diverse and inclusive workplace Job security, career advancement, and stress of project deadlines Gave me a window into another world Before working at HPE, I was with Microsoft IT. I learned more about IT in 8 years with HPE than 20+ years at Microsoft. That said, both companies are more concerned about their bottom line than anyone's work-life balance. Getting on a plane early Monday morning an maybe getting home at 2am Saturday is maybe someone's sick idea of work-life balance, but not mine. I did learn a lot about real-world customer requirements, though. None Travel Fun Place to Work I interned here and learned so much. All of my supervisors did so much to help me meet people in my field and learn more about my field in general. My manager was honest, open, and transparent and I always felt supported in my team. Great pay and no dress code The pay is good but be prepared to work until 1 in the morning sometimes. The work life balance is not there and it is hard to have family time. I do not recommend this job for single parents without support. Employees were considered costs Very stable environment but few opportunities for advancements. Underpaying employees in general, and the reason was salaries took the greatest part of company's expenses. What else would you pay in an IT consulting company? Great benefits HPE is a great place to work with good benefits, however there are a lot of lay offs which makes it feel uneasy a lot of the time. Overall I have enjoyed my time here. Lots of opportunities, lots of red tape new headquarters is nice. Overall, pretty good...but teams are in there own space and hard to work across. Great for getting time off, pay is average/below average with the market--not market leaders. The culture is engaging and becoming more and more inclusive. HPE is a great place to work. The management team has a clear sense of direction and communicates that effectively. I believe HPE is starting to walk the walk from a diversity and inclusion perspective. HPE provides opportunities to train and learn new skills and technologies as well. Culture, corporate strategy Strategy is narrowly focused Nice people, but definitely a grind I worked in a support center, in-bound calls to our help desk for a client contracted to the company. The people at HP were nice, but the atmosphere was very corporate-- no surprises. Professionally and personally rewarding family-centric work environment. - Hard work - Frequent long hours - Manages multiple high-visibility projects - Stratospheric levels of both internal and external responsibility and accountability - Exacting personal standards of quality - Reinforced concrete work ethic - Goal-oriented professional development - Leader, peer, mentor, advocate, friend Interesting tech, but constant threat to job security Hewlett Packard Enterprise has really good server technology for a nerd like myself to work with, but the downsides of working at Hewlett Packard Enterprise is the constant looming threat of layoffs. I found it boring and complacent, but an easy place to earn a paycheck. My review is a bit different considering I worked for a company that got aquired by HPE. The culture at HPE was quite boring, unenergetic, and old. Wasn't something I woke up for and was excited to be doing. They paid well and was extremely easy to meet any expectations. Good pay, flexible schedule Not an invigorating culture or work environment Great place to work Great place to work, never doing the same job over and over again. Traveling all over PA and WV meeting new customers and installing new equipment on a daily basis Cut the workers keep the non Was a great place 15 years ago until people didn't matter. Multiple CEOs over the years driving in different directions. too much management without enough workers. Pay Brown nose wins out over hard workers 1 Great place to work with numerous opportunities to grow I love HPE because my senior peers are always willing to help. Besides that, the company is big so there are lots of teams and interesting projects to work at. Great compensation Remote work Vaccine requirement on site (you can get an exemption) No sense of direction I was at HPR for 11 years as part of an acquisition and never found a sense of purpose. Management did not give me a sense or direction and most days I didn’t know what my goals were Work from home Just didn’t have a clear sense of direction Complete product line for all IT needs No set schedule as long as you get your work done, in sales at least. Very good ongoing training and product development. Culture is relaxed. Most difficult part is working with other divisions of the company. More about that below. Good pay, flexible schedules Most difficult part is working with other divisions of the company. More about that below. HPE will treat you like famlily Great flexibility and benefits. Job Security/Advancement is great. Job Work/Life Balance exceeded expectations The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with. great place to work and great peiple Great place to work and great people to work with. Everyone is helpful and provide support. The benefits are good. The management is very supportive. Good place to work, good people, pay should be better. A typical day at work is hit and miss. One day I may have 10 calls and none on others. There is always something to work on or improve. I have learned that although communication is key, not EVERYTHING needs to be communicated. No one needs a play by play commentary. Just work hard and get things done. Management is very much political. Workplace culture is completely all inclusive. HPE does a great job to make sure MOST groups are recognized and have a voice. They are very supportive and allow everyone to ""belong"" somewhere within the company. The hardest part of the job is probably the most common hardest part of jobs... working with different people with different attitudes. Some people are very open, honest, and friendly but most are pushy and self serving. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to be involved and change and see change. Work life balance, time off for wellness, flexibility Pay is not very competitive- just high enough to make you stay Good pay, constant chaos With all the acquisitions and then company separations, there is a re-org usually every two years. Lots of layoffs, or reassignments. At higher levels, a lot of power playing managers, people in charge that have zero experience in the subject they are managing, constant changes in management. Compensation Long hours, constant re-orgs and layoffs A Company with a vision but some difficulty executing The company has a great business model with the GreenLake solutions but seems to be under staffing to meet the needed demands that customers have. I believe the executives have the employees best interests in mind when it comes to diversity, inclusion, and benefits but it does not translate once it reaches the front lines. I worked long long hours and the stress levels were such that I could not maintain a healthy work/life balance in my last year and decided to retire to preserve my health. If you are young, ambitious, with a high level of energy and enthusiasm this company could be the right place for you. Great people Supportive managers Diversity A lot of stress Work/like balance difficult to maintain HP didn't know what it was getting into with EDS I worked for EDS when it was acquired by HP, so became part of HP. It shortly became clear that HP was more a product-focused company not a services company (i.e. shutting down all offices for 2 weeks around Christmas/New Years: that doesn't work when we support clients around the clock). Good work/life balance in the positions I had; good technical people, but pay was lagging which was why I jumped ship. Good compensation if top performer and great WLB but slow career progress HPE takes care of you if you are performing great. WLB is amazing as no one pushes you to stress out and over deliver. Projects are medium paced and not demanding. Career growth might be slow if you get in a role that does repetitive work in legacy technology. great wlb. 6 month parental leave. nice 401k match. slow career growth Liked the role I enjoyed the work I did here, however there were many people in the division that were negative. The negativity could make some situations toxic at times. Freedom to take days off when needed not a team environment. some people work really hard, and others don't. Management does not seem to care. Expectation is to work overtime with no competition Unfortunately, a lot of lay offs, no replacements and staff are expected to compensate for the lay offs with extended hours. No work life balance at all. Upper management is disorganized and staff are expected to work all hours of the day and night to keep up with different time zones. Late nights, early meetings. Flexible with doctor appointments and good healthcare benefits No work life balance at all Great people, very helpful and great management who listens to the employees' needs and also fun to work. Great place to work for and great people too! Great culture and when they offered the option to work remotely helped a lot with balancing personal and work life. Benefits are great. Great place to work while you are there It is a great place to work, but you will be under constant threat of layoff. Seems to be a pretty consistent 2 rounds of WFR per year, but while you are there it is a nice place to be. Pretty relaxed on PTO Corporate doesn't support those beneath them. Great people, great environments, but compensation is low I like say that all the people I worked and the team members were very friendly and cooperative. Culture of the company is very good and the projects are well organized and well-documented. All types opportunities are for career development. It is a very good company but only issue is the salary. Another big corporation that only cares about shareholders. They laid off the entire facility I worked at. They really only care about quarterly profits and stock price. They talk about all the things they do to care for their employees, but they will cut you loose on a moments notice if it suits them. Don't work there anymore No Equality Ok place to work. Not enough pay for dealing with irate county members on a daily basis. Company bought out every two, three years. Workers completing supervisor duties with no addt pay….and temps make more than employees. Knowledge Horrible healthcare, inbound callers are always rude Great workplace I worked at HPE for many years, and they do have a great culture. Life balance is encouraged, and there are opportunities to grow. Unfortunately, these opportunities can be somewhat tedious to find but not difficult so you have to always be on the lookout or miss them. With that said, HPE does accomplishes a lot for their employees and I always felt that I was well taken care of. Fun place, great family and great careers. Great accommodations, good diversity, awesome culture Very small windows to advance, job security Going through a notable transition to re-brand ourselves in the hybrid cloud space Slowly trying to re-brand as a hybrid cloud company which comes with some cultural and inertial challenges but also some excitement and buzz - will be curiously to see how this plays out performance-wise 6 months of for maternity / paternity leave minimal salary raises unless promoted which takes 3+ years Great place to work Great place to work, never doing the same job over and over again. Traveling all over PA and WV meeting new customers and installing new equipment on a daily basis HP Enterprise better than HPI Neither company is great but Enterprise is much better now that Meg Whitman is gone. The company decreased 401k contributions and Giannou moved it back up but both HPs are not my diarist choi e No Meg Whitman Not growing 1 Great work / life balance and very supportive teams My managers and colleagues have all been genuine and want to work together to create products. There's just some internal organization conflict sometimes that causes friction, which is common for big enterprise companies. It's great within my own organization, but expanding to others, it feels silo'd. Work/life balance, team culture Company politics 1 Productive and a fun place I loved this job. It was easy and my coworkers were super nice and helpful. They have good health benefits. Lunch room was pretty big so that’s always nice. Processes were somewhat behind times. Overall business strategy was there but some processes where not adequate thus leaving some customers dissatisfied. Freedom to think on your own. Some processes were broken. Great Job I like working at Hewlett Packard Enterprise. I enjoy good work life balance and the ability to work from home. I work on interesting projects with people around the country and world. Wellness Friday Good effective teamwork Effective teamwork, though personality and ego play their parts. I often felt that various leaders would vie for controll of the direction and control of the teams, deciding what was to be done, when and if... Always busy, plenty of work. Team leaders vs controlling oversite Logo Hewlett-Packard with a great place to work being a customer engineer. I love dealing with customers and doing hands-on repairs system boards hard drive replacement memory desktop renewal and asset renewal Treat your job as your business Supervision resides in a totally different state Productive workplace Good place to work with opportunities for advancing. Supportive management who look out for employees. Pay is good and good work life balance at the company Great people, interesting work The work place is full of good people, The work is interesting always keeps you learning. spacious area to get work done, Very flexible of work/home life Good people interesting work No help with assignments Constant learning opportunities coupled with work life balance As IT is very dynamic, every day at work generally entailed intriguing challenges and thus got to learn something new regularly. This was enhanced by the organization's culture of collaboration and constant training sessions. The organization also encouraged work life balance, and even gave employees 3 hours every month of wellness paid time off to be spent focusing on yourself or your family. They also offered 6 months paid maternity and paternity leave. Started out great but was horrible towards end First 10 years were great with good hours and great purpose. Last 6 were muddy and direction was lost. Managers lost their way and jobs declined and lost purpose. Glad layoffs happened. Flexible time off managers lost their way Good place to start Good place to start a career. Not the company it once was and difficult seeing so many empty buildings . Still good people there doing good work and thats all you can ask for. Work as a 3rd party vendor the experience I had working for the vendor who was contracted by HPE was a very eye opening experience we were told from day one to work hard and we would be brought on full time with HPE but that didn't turn out to be remotely true I can't place blame on one particular party but both sides ended the contract poorly Productive environment Great co-workers and excellent benefits package. I feel like the is an outrageous amount of competitiveness for promotions and that can create some animosity between already satisfied team members. Work environment Competitive Excellent Mgt support. Top place to work, very supportive environment. Management is result oriented but very supportive of employee needs too. I have worked over there for 34 years. Lots of freedom to deliver results Difficult Competitive Market productive and fun really fun company to work ! meeting deadlines really make a great impression, management is really not bad and workplace culture is excellent! hardest free lunches deadlines 100% WFH option Big company, with typical benefits. Nice new parent leave (6 months off) and flex hours with job. After COVID, most employees have the option of working from home 100% of the time. Pay is below average. Quarterly WFR The company laid off a small number of people every quarter so they don't get exposed to bad PR. The best folks earning the highest salaries tend to be the first to let go. KPI metric can be easily manipulated. Little bonus and motivation for employees to exceed expectations. Middle management is not trustworthy. Work-life balance Office politics, poor middle management Good starting place Good place to learn but pay was low and no opportunities for promotion. The management was hands off as long as you did your job properly. Many overtime opportunities - in fact overtime was mandatory. Management leaves you alone as long as you do your job Low pay and no promotions Great team work and excellent leaders I enjoyed everyday I worked there. I started in San Diego then moved to Palo Alto and loved every minute of it. I was stretched in my role and my leaders were always willing to allow me to do more and more. My last years at HP I worked on the separation team and we worked hard but always had fun. I learned so much during this period in time. great leaders Leaders changed quickly so you are always learning a new way Great place to work Great place to work, never doing the same job over and over again. Traveling all over PA and WV meeting new customers and installing new equipment on a daily basis Great job while it lasted It was a tough job but great people and workplace helped get us through the difficult times. Miss having the ping pong table as that helped relieve some of the work stress. Always doing cost cutting measures and reorganizations that continued to put more pressure on remaining team members. Ended up getting cut after the company split. 1 White male dominance and crab in a barrel environment with certain departments This company does have a great work life balance but it's still up to to your management team, so you may not get the perks like everyone else. My manager over stepped personal boundaries Amenities, work life balance, employee programs Micromanaged, Hostile work environment 1 Good people and good products for a disappearing market What a shame, one of the last original old-school IT hardware companies just slowly withering away. The company sells solid legacy premise based IT products, but to a shrinking market. Unimaginably complex back-office processes coupled with mid-management politics have the company tied in a knot. A knot that even a great CEO can't undo. Time to completely tear it down and start over. Co-workers, flexibility Biggest impediments to success are internal processes Overall HPE is a good company to work for. Still a good company to work for but it seems like it's starting to decline. Many good employees lost their jobs due to outsourcing and positions being eliminated. Good work/life balance. Excellent benefits. Job security due to changes Excelente empresa Me encanto trabajar para Hewlett Packard Enterprise, es una excelente empresa con un muy buen ambiente laboral y muy buenas prestaciones para los empleados. Te dan la flexibilidad para poder equilibrar tu vida laboral y personal, además de muchas facilidades como trabajar desde casa cuando se requiera. En general, ha sido la mejor empresa para la que he trabajado. Prestaciones, ambiente laboral, carrera laborar No tengo ningún contra para esta empresa HP sucks Pay is terrible. Culture is terrible. No chance for advancement but lots of chances to lose your position due to never ending changes in leadership and repetition of selling the company. Cannot complain as my first professional experience after university Unfortunately the pandemic stood in my career at the company but having struggling since day 1 with disruption in business, HPE managed to have all alternatives before going straight to the workforce reduction. Anything else, can't really complain that HPE was my first company after graduating. Great working environment and freedom to perform task as best as possible Should centralize on-boarding and presentation for pre-made product for new employees Great wlb but seems to lack growth. Nice coworkers. Intern project was interesting. Got a return offer but the role seemed to lack hands-on work. Return offer required interview rounds but were casual in nature and more about past experiences (no brain teasers, etc). Nice and respectful coworkers, Great wlb as most employees have family, Older workforce. actual implementation and design work outsourced, Moves slowly, Growth opportunity seems limited, Bad cafeteria food especially if vegetarian, No free snacks or fruits, Only coffee and lipton tea. Great First Job Opportunity Great experience obtained for my first job. As a college student fresh out of college, I gained top notch experience and it looks great on my resume when searching for newer positions! However, job security was not one of their strong suits. Hour Lunches Lack of Job Security Great company - support from the highest position to the lowest. HPE is a company that truly cares for their employees, no matter of position. Everyone works together as a team and collaborates freely. Prior to Covid when we worked in the offices, it was very casual and comfortable. Teamwork, amazing support worked remote, good experience Worked with highly intelligent, dedicated people. Most in my group were remote. Very organized and professional co-workers. Good communication in the organization. It's Just OK. Worked as a software developer in the services area. It was fine. Some of the HP Fellows have no clue what they are doing. Management was more interested in making sales than really helping the customer, and some management was clueless about the technology. Relaxed Environment I loved my time here. It was laid back and relaxed environment. Loved the people. Work life balance was great. True culture. Maybe not for eveyone. FOr me it was a great match Work Life Balance Not very fast paced, if you are a very ambitious person Went from low to no morale Al hat, no cattle! They talk vision to clients and post sale they are nowhere to be found. Clients complain their reps change too often. Clients need better consistent support Customers made it worthwhile Management changes annually Overall, I find working at HP fun and new each day I attend a new location or work force. Each time I go to a work location I archive my goals with the assistance of management and other staff. The overall culture environment is a great asset to the work schedule I have enjoyed because I never get bored conversing with other workers simply based on their point of view to products and special events. Something that makes the days much more interesting for me. paid lunch and travel time and monthly events. Time restrictions. Management stinky They are back stabbers, clueless folks in management. This game is a numbers game for them. They act very sincere to your face but throw anybody under a bus for their own advancement. There are tooo many good jobs out there. Stay away from this place and get a real career! snacks! too many to list Worked at HP for 23 years. Very productive organization I worked the night-shift for 23 years. I loved it, our shift was slowly widdled down from approximately 200 workers to about 25 workers. My co-workers were awesome, felt more like a family. Good benefits, Supportive Supervisors Jobs out sourced which cost people their jobs. Everyone complains about b set big over worked and doing more than one persons job due to all the layoffs and no replacement but only increased work No one has job security at this company over the last 15 years. Too many changes in this company and not enough continuity. They have no since of work life balance in the Financial dept. Pto and you can work from hone Healthcare expense Good entey level opportunity but compensation is unfoar akd based on the account segment uou are given upon hire. Good entey level opportunity but compensation is unfair and based on the account segment you are given upon hire. Day to day work is demanding. Performance is rated on your talk time and number of calls you make a day. Good out of college job with big company Low moral Great place to work Overall, HP is a great place to work. Compensation & benefits amongst the best. A lot of expectations beyond daily assignments like Virtual Global Meetings, minimum training hours per year, etc. definitive processes & standards. Expectations well defined & measured. Occasionally wrong person put in charge of projects"
Tesla|" Uncertainty Liked some of jobs, detailing cars, delivering to homes, vehicle movement/inventory. Uncertainty is part of the culture, work is constantly changing, position may or may not exist tomorrow, or later today. Amazing product, crazy CEO with no sense of loyalty. Mechanics seem to have most consistent and well funded department. Drive the best cars made Uncertainty Very fun and fast pace but very detailed Great days every day. The only bad thing I can say us the drive to and from work. Need to have bigger roads and aswell make it easier to relieve stocks. Great benefits. Driving to and from work dangerous 1 Extremely busy, pay is fair Management are constantly out for blood. High turnover, unrealistic expectations and quotas to hit. It’s a constant competition that you don’t even realize you’re in until it’s too late. Can’t leave your department unless your manager says it’s okay, but they sabotage you to keep you there so they don’t have to rehire. 1 Fun, long hours and a free ride Great place to work at, easy money, watch a machine and work, long rest room breaks and quick lunches, if this fits your daily life balance then this is the job for you. cool nice place very long schedule big building bubble look but key yea you thank bc the joke fun this world you have become bigger better enlightenment 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? Nothing really they over work you for to 12 hrs a day and nothing over 8 hrs is over time What is the most stressful part about working at the company? They have you working for 12 hrs with only small breaks and they don’t want to set because they we’ll fire you What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Really bad What is a typical day like for you at the company? Stress full Easy job lots of overtime Good company pretty relaxed and all the overtime you want plus they have free coffee and snacks at the break room Management is good will train you diferente areas Was a great place to work but not anymore When I started working at Tesla it was an amazing working environment, I’ve been driving a truck for Tesla for over a year and up until three months ago it has been an amazing experience however due to new management they have a lack of safety and driver concerns. As long as current management is in place I highly recommend not working here because it is a stressful environment and bad for your mental health. Pay and Benefits Management, working environment Fail forward type company/ Great start-up energy Worked with very driven, creative and supportive people that were eager in working in data science and machine learning. personally, management has allows shown me the doors of possibilities to other oppurtunities, but I can say that for all managers. Day to day job can be somewhat repetitive, but interesting daily conversation topics and and changes in priorities made the work place more interesting. Long days off, pay is okay 12 hour shifts aren't fun but they're doable. It's a lottery system to see where you'll be put. Management will watch someone get hurt and tell people to keep working like nothing happened. long days off 12 hour shifts, management sucks Team player Fast pace and stressful Team player, good culture. Great pay and benefits Great insurance, good stock Friendly and great to growth Training class and learning new equipment Great People to work with, However you dont have a life outside of working there We work about 9-12 everyday except weekends we work night shift so that means pretty much not life in the day time after work. we work all night long almost until the sun comes up. It is fun work environment with music and motivation, however it can get a little stressful sometimes when we are behind but that is with any production environment. Great Benifts Hours Exciting work but terrible culture Return to office mandate was rushed and gave no consideration to employees as human beings. Hemorrhaging talent left and right with no end in sight. The work and products are exciting, but how many talented engineers will continue to work here given the CEO and low pay? Fast Paced Workplace Often came in to work with a full planned workday. Delivered about 5-9 cars on average, and spent the rest of the workday maintaining the workplace, and wiping down cars. Decent pay, slow periods in between deliveries Paid late on several occasions Employees are numbers not people Management does not care about the employee. They fired someone I used to work with on his way into work, made him turn around. When they know you are doing something important, life changing, they will fire you. Is been done before over and over. I tried to move my classification up in the company but got tremendous push back. Not willing to train you to make yourself a better technician. Management are snakes. Special places for them. None Everythibf 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Flexibility and creativity to do one's job. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Large workforce What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Very fast paced. Things are always changing. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Most days are busy dealing with employee concerns and issues. Super Productive & Extremely Stressful Great pay & benefits is always a good thing. But, being told to work 12 hours a day, coming in super early, no parking, as well as intense pressure job from our higher ups because they want to meet demand everyday. The main reason everyone leaves is because they would try to do their own thing and/or move to day shift releasing all hands on deck for the entire night. Everybody acts like high school kids fighting in the cafeteria line for cutting; driving crazy on the road; shuttle buses passing people; reducing parking and taking long breaks during our shift. What’s worse is nobody would acknowledge any protocols until the people in the higher position will recognize one too many complaints, but it is what is it. It seemed like Tesla was way too eager to come out to compete with the auto industry, however they never really thought about ironing out their kinks unless it involves losing money. I would value my own safety, unless I need a job to help pay my bills if that’s one of the main reasons to come and work here. Great job with great people. I love the job. If you like to build things you probably will too. Plenty of overtime if you want it and great benefits. The management team is supportive and wants you to succeed. I highly recommend if you have a great attitude and good work ethic. Devious employer, below average pay for equivalent positions I do not know what my NDA covers so I can not provide details. Overall, this company uses KPIs for evaluation despite that they will not always provide the information and tools required to meet such expectations. This company will let employees go without any justification. HR is a joke. Co-workers and managers are pitted against each other to maintain employment or advance. This company will absolutely instruct you to lie to customers, will change your job entirely and fully expect you to adjust with a moments notice. There is not a single upper manager that has not compromised their own judgement and character to remain in their position. People will ask you all the time how much you love your job and how cool the company must be to work for and you will lie and agree 1000s of times while your soul sinks lower each time. Very good benefits everything else You will be just a number, not a human. Pay sucked, stocks were good, health benefits were excellent. I’ve never seen such a poorly managed corporation in my life. Constant mass layoffs with no notice, work life balance is trash-they have a lot of mandatory over time. Training is trash, nobody knows what they’re doing and that’s apparent with how terrible customer experience is. Don't work here unless your willing to deal with burnout and a toxic work enviroment I worked here for 3+ years as a Recruiter. Everything you read about work life balance and a toxic work culture is true. Things are barely being held together by (true amazing) people that decide to work here, but no one is calling out real changes that need to be made in fear of being fired. Priorities at the company are constantly shifting in ridiculous ways solely based off what Elon wants. If you are going to work as a Sourcer or Recruiter here you won't be a treated partner with your hiring teams. The pay and benefits are good, but it really wasn't worth it. Uncertainty Liked some of jobs, detailing cars, delivering to homes, vehicle movement/inventory. Uncertainty is part of the culture, work is constantly changing, position may or may not exist tomorrow, or later today. Amazing product, crazy CEO with no sense of loyalty. Mechanics seem to have most consistent and well funded department. Drive the best cars made Uncertainty Easiest cdl job ever Easy work just have to deal with people who make decisions who've never held a cdl but that's everywhere schedule and benefits are amazing get to stay home to see my family a lot 2 You get what you put in I wish I stayed. Goood money great schedule I had , only thing sucked is sometimes you work with people with big egos. However you Can definitely make friends, it’s always hot most of the time which I didn’t care for , I just wish they had more shuttles in more Bart locations . 12 hours will mess with you in the first two weeks but after a month and a half you should be fine . 1 1 Easy Extremly easy braindead work you are just a body they need. Very long 12 hour shifts. The worst part working here is the drive from Reno everyday sucks. Sales is Great for Any Car/Tech Enthusiast The CSR role allowed for some great conversations with customers. The transition from CSR to Owner Advisor leads to a more traditional sales experience. Poor environment A toxic environment where you are not encouraged to grow. Flat structure allows the senior management team to manipulate job roles and responsibilities without any notice or thought process. There’s better Ehhh there’s better besides benefits. Management is a huge problem. Not enough training. Lot of back stabbing. It’s a place you do hard work repetitively 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? The feeling of accomplishment when our group meets our goals and the company succeeds. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Finding a work-life balance was difficult when working on a small team. Later on our team grew and responsibilities were better distributed. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? High expectations and very capable employees. Work hard and play hard, rewarding when the company is successful. Enthusiastic people who know the hard work will pay off and make a difference. What is a typical day like for you at the company? At the time, I would typically prep ATD's for upcoming tests, or extract dummies from that day's crashes. Any time not working with the crash team was spent building the dummy test lab. Meetings were few and hours were long. Free cereal and snacks, excellent benefits and good feedback. Semi production was new and exciting. Working on something that has never been done before. Engineering was very informative and taught accordingly. Safety was a must. Supervisor was helpful. The benefits are awesom! Long hours Long hours and sometimes mandatory overtime 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? Being a part of a growing and exciting field What is the most stressful part about working at the company? 3 sick days a year What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Competitive and unforgiving A good company but sucks management! The company is good but the managemet is sucks starting from the upper management. Well, anyway they can hire as much worker as they want but they can't hire loyal people like us anymore that cares the products. No growth! You can be promoted if you know somebody in the management. They don't care if you are qualified for the job, what they want is ""WHO YOU KNOW""! 901 page management screw them! Fun work environment. Room for growth. I loved working for tesla. It was really fun. The work environment was positive. The managers were always very understanding. The company really put a lot back into its employees. I was super sad that medical issues caused me to have to let my job go. Crazy how fast-pace and unorganized this place is Pros: Great community, cool and smart people, great sense of belonging for sure Cons: Moving so fast that no one can catch a break, performance are objective-driven, WLB is a joke. Very productive and faced paced work style. Very fast passes but it has a really bad work like balance. They always expect you to work more then what you originally thought. They are not very transparent with workers on day to day things and dont let you know of the plans that they know until very close to when things get implemented. Shifty management Lots of l ame manager's they have no skills at all . They found a way to get rid of all the ta l ent that management feared. An absolute joke. Many safety issues, no fire protection that's sufficient . Toxic masculinity and under compensated Tesla has that ""work hard for little pay"" philosophy. They expect you to do more without increasing pay. Everyone gets the same raises whether you work hard or not, so there's no incentive to drive hard work either. Would not recommend to anyone with any sense of self respect. Plenty of amenities Everything else Not too bad The company had really great benefits but there was a lot of favorites from the managers. In terms of growing as a service technician, it depends on you and the managers on whether they are willing to let you go to the next level. Work you hard and threaten you when you start slipping Come here if you want a place that offers great benefits and flexible hours in exchange for mandatory overtime and threats from you manager on a regular basis. Flexible working hours Threatening, competitive environment 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? The work environment is great What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Nothing at all What is the work environment and culture like at the company? It is amazing What is a typical day like for you at the company? Fast and easy None Great company yo work for. Unfortunately too many changes affected the pay. You won't be able to determine your actually income and always nervous about if your position will be available the following month Constantly a 2nd thought Our team here grinds, puts in work non stop only to be told we have to move locations within 24 hours. The new location is at least an hour round trip for all employees. No thought for the team who touches every single car that comes to the Portland area. And to top it off the location provided for the team is smaller than the warehouse we currently work. This is an unorganized mess and we now practically work at two locations for no more pay, I’ll be shocked if my team stays any longer. Uncertainty Liked some of jobs, detailing cars, delivering to homes, vehicle movement/inventory. Uncertainty is part of the culture, work is constantly changing, position may or may not exist tomorrow, or later today. Amazing product, crazy CEO with no sense of loyalty. Mechanics seem to have most consistent and well funded department. Drive the best cars made Uncertainty 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? In the beginning before the buddy buddy system got in place. They started putting unqualified people in positions that had no business being in. Managers girlfriends, best friends, and cousins started getting put in leadership positions and they were definitely not the best person for the job. Pay sucked and they always laid off every year and a half or so. It was just the best place to work for the Reno, Nevada area. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Having to deal with incompetent leadership What is the work environment and culture like at the company? The associates were great, the leadership sucked majorly What is a typical day like for you at the company? As long as the incompetent leadership allowed us to do what we were adequately trained to do left us along the days ran smoothly 1 bad place to work not a place to work at if you want to move up. a lot of hard work and 12hrs shift. the only up side to this job is that you get to see cars not yet shown to the public. 2 Easy but packed Fairly easy but a lot of miscommunication. Also takes a good 20 minutes to get out of the parking lot and not enough doors for the immense amount of workers. Bad So bad. Do not work here. You will be given job duties that are more complicated than what you applied for, and you will not get compensated for more work. Tesla it is Going good but hard , you can do it. Everyday we can learn thing and do our man ,management is good too , but the hard thing is 12 hour is no joke man Monotone days that could be spend elsewhere Learning a process or two takes a few days to learn. Then it becomes old very quickly. There is no way to move for at least half a year and is not guaranteed. It is vital to make a contact with managers to get any chance advancement. The community is very diverse. It is possible to find a few great people but the rest it is pretty toxic. It becomes rarer but the factory has shutdowns, when your time is cut and have to be made up by Over Time. Long shifts, long traffic, and no parking is something that you'll need to get used to around the factory. Overall, it is cool to know that you are part of a huge company and to see the Electric Vehicles roll out, but it comes at a hefty cost. Tesla is great career choice Working with Tesla is everything you'd imagine it to be. Friendly inclusive workspace, solution oriented, great pay and even better benefits. At Tesla we are one big team and the support is always there when you need it. Re-evaluation of management in production Some areas of management are great, and others are incompetent. Some production supervisors show lack of leadership skills, organization and inability to perform any of the work that they supervise. 2 stars What is the best part of working at the company? The benefits are great What is the most stressful part about working at the company? The paranoid culture and know it all Tesla bros What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Paranoid and exclusionary What is a typical day like for you at the company? They’ll bleed everything they can get from from you. I worried about injury there every day. Decent pay, great benefits Not enough money to live by today's standards, tons of empty promises. The company promises advancement, but unless your a 20 something with a background from a grocery store you aren't going anywhere. Lies lies lies When we first got hired, we were told in the initial phone interview that we were going to be working 4 days. Once in orientation, we were then told that we will be working five days a week until they hire more people. The factory is very hot. The work culture is very stressful. I can’t wait to find another job. This place sucks Hard work with good pay and benifits Hired on I felt a sense of belonging, supervisors and leads were eager to train, advise and check in. I never felt that I was left alone to figure out my position and had opportunity to move departments. The hours are long (12hrs) with chance of overtime and depending on department and shift my schedule worked out well! only major issue is I was far from home, though they do have shuttles/vanpools. Oh, be prepared to arrive early to find parking. benefits, 401k pan, dental, vision, pay, transits limited parking, distance Great pay, work hard Love working with this company. Straight up no frills. However, get ready for a burnout. Keep your head up, do your best job, and appreciate your better than average pay per hour. Overall good Very intelligent and passionate co workers. Lots of room to learn and grow. Poor work life balance and toxic culture. If you are not careful you can burn out fast, on the flip side you will learn a lot in a short period of time. Ever evolving stressful work environment with some advancement opportunity Ever-evolving, stressful work environment with some advancement opportunities. It's a good place for creators and innovators to work on interesting projects. No support from management poorly managed The pay is not the industry standard but the benefits are great. Working at this service center you are overworked with no time left for a life outside. Parts are a mess as parts are never in stock and asking for updates is impossible. The techs are not very helpful as most are new and the shop lead is never around. When asking for help from management both are always more eager to test drive cars than help with customers. It wasn’t like that before but as the company got more customers the management got worst. I’d say the only thing that’s good is the benefits. Great knowledge terrible appreciation I have been at Tesla for 2 months and have yet to feel any progression with the knowledge that coincides with the task at hand still 50/50 on if I stay for the long haul but the lack of communication kinda has me hanging out the door You live and learn Not a bad gig job getting a call every three months. And also me meeting really cool people and getting to deliver the cars basically deliveries miles to the customer. 3 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Work environment is fast paced; there is no lack of work. Working at Tesla is existing and healthy. Employees are friendly and helpful. Pay is not so great. Other then that it is a great place to work. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Trying to keep up with quota and still achieving 100% in quality. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? The people I work with make things fun and sometimes challenging. We all get along great. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Hurry and wait. We rush rush rush then wait because we run out of parts. 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? People love that Tesla name. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? You are a bot. Buffalo annotation candidates should expect pressure. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Cliques. No culture since you’re literally there just to work. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Drive. Login. Work 8.5 hours w two 15 minute breaks and a half hour lunch. Leave. Uncertainty Liked some of jobs, detailing cars, delivering to homes, vehicle movement/inventory. Uncertainty is part of the culture, work is constantly changing, position may or may not exist tomorrow, or later today. Amazing product, crazy CEO with no sense of loyalty. Mechanics seem to have most consistent and well funded department. Drive the best cars made Uncertainty Fall in Line or your gone This location In particular. Extremely understaffed with no effort to hire. job went from sales to robot action. No longer are you selling youres imply chasing people down over the phone who ordered online. Management helicopters and micromanages every aspect of your pipeline extreme gaslighting across the entire staff expecting to put in 10 to 14 hour days at the end of the quarter no matter what and enjoy it, If you are a fall in line sheep type person You may have a chance to stay here for a while, but they just seem to have a habit of letting go those of the hardest working employees, who just happen to have stock vesting shortly. Do not trust upper management here. Do not trust any upper management in the New York metro region shady individuals who are money motivated and do not care about their employees the very type to smile at you and say you're doing a great job and go fire you the next day on your day off beware working at this location, or any other show room in the region cars are great cars are great. Cars are great but the company is run very inefficiently. Incentives constantly being changed giving you less that 1% commission on 90 vehicles sold/Q. False sense of moral, every one is just over worked and fed up with the promise of change only to be in a worse situation 3 months later. Good Luck lol 2 Worst job I’ve ever had Avoid at all costs. Trust me. The most depressing environment you’ll ever work in. They don’t actually care about you. They run this place so horrendously that they can’t even hide it. Training is horrible. The customers are horrible. The most soul sucking job I’ve ever had in my life. I quit this job with nothing else lined up because I cried before work everyday and it wasn’t worth sacrificing my sanity. I was legitimately jealous of the janitors who cleaned the office. Just don’t work here. 5 Very much enjoyed my time at Tesla Worked on the driveline. PM1. D shift. Hours are long but pay is really good if you pick up some OT here and there. Which was plentiful during covid. My particular management was outstanding. Didn't experience any hot headedness or big ego's. Met a lot of people and I'd say 99% of them were really cool. The job itself was pretty easy. Can be hard on the body at first. I could barely walk after my first week due to poor footwear. but a month in and that went away. Invest in some good insoles. Paid $80 for mine. Great productive fast working environment Great place to work at I would stay and become a regular permanent employee plenty space and opportunity to move up and climb the employee ladder and effeciently become a valuable asset to the company 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? Leaving getting off work What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Continuous changes. And company doesn’t care about its employees What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Mixed environment What is a typical day like for you at the company? Rather not answer Alright pay in exchange for your entire life The best thing I can say about working here is my coworkers were always very patient and willing to help out. Managers were rough and didn’t listen. I’d often get blamed for things I didn’t do, and trying to explain things only caused them to double down on the blaming. Pay is decent. Still not enough to afford even a studio apartment in the area. And you’ll have no personal life unless you plan on being full of pain meds and energy drinks every moment you’re off the clock. 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? It's always something new to learn What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Challenges your Self What is the work environment and culture like at the company? It's really fun to work in tesla What is a typical day like for you at the company? Falloing time be top of you game Unconcerned Upper management doesn't care. Constant changes that don't benefit the employees or consumers. Pay should be more based on the job you perform. Underpaid, great health benefits and stock. Great benefits/pay As an intern, you have to be a fast learner or you will drag behind with no help. Management is fairly organized and efficient at most things. Benefits/pay If you don't pick things up fast, you will have a hard time. Warehouse job Working at a warehouse can be exhausting at time but it isn’t always hard because you get use to it. If you want a ”better” paying job, I feel like working at a warehouse would be the easiest way to do it. Serious work place They don’t play around, really serious about what they do. I don’t blame them. Everything is kept a secret for obvious reasons. The job starts at 6am to 6pm or if you work nights 6pm to 6am. You have 2 10 minute breaks then you have a 30 minute break. Hardest part of the job is just getting to work. It’s always super busy around the factory, tons of construction happening. The most enjoyable part is seeing the cars and leaving to go home in my opinion. Cool place to be at but is also a beast to say the least You have a lot of room to grow if you are willing to put in the work. Just be ready to make sacrifices with your time. You will meet a lot of different people though since the place is so large and the company parties are cool when they do have them. Bad work place No communication everything they said was a lie they did care about the employees no breaks building full of roaches everything was so unorganized never any reply’s Very smart individuals It was a great experience, learned a lot in my short time there. Very fast pace and sometimes there is no direction. That only affects those with no self motivation, if you work hard and follow their flow and do not complain you will be fine. Ok job, depends where you end up. Decent enough workplace. Depends on where you end up. Some lines and departments (especially in manufacturing or production on the factory floor) are much harder than others. My line has a great location and is close to many breakrooms, restrooms, and the main entrance. Some departments are the opposite. Work is grueling but decent enough for a starting position. My coworkers are great and are the biggest reason why I don't completely hate it there. Management can be a joke a lot of times. Must hustle really hard to get noticed and absolutely utilize all the tools they have for you that they don't tell you about to move up and advance from scratch. long days off. Benefits. long work days. rest room locations. management. Productive and fun workplace Very production based with high attention to detail. Great management. Company stock options after probationary time. Long 12 hours day but overall very good place to work at. Great learning experience I was able to learn so much from management while plotting my steps to the top. Great growth potential if your willing to sit behind a supervisor or manager and soak up knowledge Be ready to put in a lot of work & figure things out on the go The biggest drawback is the lack of organization & direction, biggest upside is the paycheck & the benefits. Be ready for chaotic scheduling & dealing with other peoples messes Tesla at symphony it park , nanded city I truly loved the training period. I was a covert operations. Regardless understood the company culture and management style. I am looking forward into handling the operations and management with indian minset and strategy. Looking forward for a beautiful friendship with tesla us & india. Free lunches Healthcare Intern experience I got to work during covid so I had an excellent hybrid schedule. 2 days in the office and three days remote. They no longer do this so it is very different working there now. I loved my team and manager but it's important that many teams are not like mine Great manager Parking Uncertainty Liked some of jobs, detailing cars, delivering to homes, vehicle movement/inventory. Uncertainty is part of the culture, work is constantly changing, position may or may not exist tomorrow, or later today. Amazing product, crazy CEO with no sense of loyalty. Mechanics seem to have most consistent and well funded department. Drive the best cars made Uncertainty Amazing place It was pretty nice interning with them for 7 months. Got all the benefits like a full time and also immersed you in the work like you were full time. No projects or anything, straight to the job. Pretty rewarding. I miss it 1 2 Fast paced with endless learning opportunities You can take on as much work as you want. There's always a project to take on and you have the freedom to choose which direction you want to take things. There are some workplace politics but that's normal. Overall a great company to work for. 2 2 Productive and tiring at times Micromanaged by my boss to produce results, good at times but the pay is good. Work life balance can be hard to achieve at times but its gotten worse and wfh is mostly going away. Be ready to sweat and put in hours It is STRESSFUL! Long hours and high turnover rate, which is why they hire more interns than anything else because we are cheap labor and will do anything to get the name on resume. Beware. If your have all the time in the world then this job is for you You won’t be able to do anything for your day if commute. Work here can be draining if you get put in ga. The management is pretty bad. As for asking for days off they’ll most of time approve Im experience Fast paced,12 hour shifts, amazing benefits for yourself and family They do not help employees who get bullied instead they neglect the problem and hope it goes away HR is a joke. They give you stock but if you leave everything you worked hard for is forfeited. I would not be returning to Tesla. Thank you for showing me new skills in my job search I wish the employees and company the best. Terrible Would make us work 14 to 16 hours a day without a break and would complain if we went to the bathroom. Told us we had to go to the bathroom in bottles or hold it. They literally let me go because once a day I would take myself in a couple of the crew members to a safe way or the closest gas station to use the bathroom and they said that wasn't okay Money Review 2022 Tesla was a good place to work for a few years ago, however after awhile you see there is little to no possibility of advancing within the company. Management would give promotions to their friend groups. However, I would say the biggest con of working in this role is that if your stats dipped below 90%, you would get weekly meetings and possibility of termination if they didn't raise back up fast. paid time off, consistent hours, benefits Lay offs, long hours, no growth within the company Not helpful People try to close out work that usnt completed. A real sense ""i did my part"", not that if it got done; no pride or accountability for the entirety of the needed work. Thankful I was given an opportunity to stay with the company I was only one of three employees that were given the opportunity to transition from SolarCity to Tesla Energy. I am happy with my decision because the location was closed nine months later. Long days Moving back and forth through cold and hot areas have very strong effects on body. Good snack bar needs to be restocked more need better transportation around building Eh Ehhh work way to hard for the pay that’s given. You can’t expect any of us to stay here for a 1 dollar raise. Extremely disappointed for the amount of work I put in To many chiefs not enough indians Teslas treatment and reliance on Temps to do all the work has created a workforce of stressed , overworked and down right exhausted crew that is unable to keep up. This “use them up and spit them out” mentality created low moral and cars that were of questionable quality when delivered. There practice of hiring and firing before the stock hiring bonus was worth any money was another deceptive practice that was especially cruel in these hard times Work place If you enjoy time with family, especially on the weekends. Don't work there. But if you enjoy time off, mostly on weekdays. Go on and knock yourself out. (Your life your choice.) Who I'm I to said. Great benfits People always complaining Fun It was fun and I enjoyed it because I was working and having fun because I was working and doing things like working and making cars like my job is to make cars. Shareholders first, Workers-first and customer-centric only enough to benefit the shareholders. I was a solar installer for Solar City which became Tesla. Initially I was a part of a 6 man residential crew which was ok, installing solar isn't rocket science. We basically had what we needed, but the pay was pretty bad when we didn't have a lot of work, which was most of the time. They gave me an opportunity to travel to Las Vegas, which I thought was great, but, it meant 60+ hour weeks and again, the pay was just ok, no significant bonuses for giving your life to the company. They were pretty bad with supporting their workers and several crews cut a lot of corners, but the real goal with Tesla/Solar City was to put up numbers to impress their shareholders. I then travelled to San Diego to work on a big military project, it started out great, getting paid a prevailing wage, but their lawyers figured out how to pay the lowest prevailing wage possible, so our pay got dropped, and overtime was prohibited. We had a year+ of consistent work before we finished it up and then several rounds of layoffs (each one they said was the last) while we got paid almost nothing to work on jobs that had been messed up previously, I was on one that we had to uninstall 5 apartment buildings worth of solar twice, to fix things that were not up to code. For these jobs I got paid less than what I started at. It was at this point I quit. The people that got promoted were the ones who put up the biggest numbers, AKA the best at cutting corners/the most arrogant. It was a very boom/bust company...but the boom cycles were mostly felt if you were in upper level management, workers definitely felt good healthcare they're always looking for a way to pay you less Productive and fun. Benifits are some of the top notch in the area provided. Good coffee available for free. Lots of room for growth and overtime. Management needs to be a people person and be mlre attentive to employees needs to succeed. Benefits were good They are hiring people straight out of the hood which those type of people dont care about their job Great place to learn and intern, up to you to stay Working here is extremely dependent on team when it comes to culture. The work is rewarding and will cause you to almost always be learning; as an intern, if you ask for more, you will get more. Great place to be treated like a full-time employee and have true ownership of projects. Fun people Fun but no structure. Systems and processes changing every week. Most employees are unhappy due to added tasks with no to little pay raise. Most people only stay because Of the given stock options and good benefits. No matter how much work you complete it’s never enough, or they just raise the minimum amount of work that is required if you consistently meet goals. Overly managed At least in my position in the field, we were hugely over micro managed in comparison to companies who were installing similar solar energy products. The stresses put on basic laborers was way out of proportion and overall communication between department's was really lacking as well. The pros that really made me excited about working for them in the first half year were progressively outweighed by the cons in the latter part of my time with them."
Sierra Club|" Productive and interesting It is a place where if you really want to do something serious for the Environment, you can do it and make a difference. I write articles and bots weekly on topics that motivate other people to understand that in the defense of the planet there are no colors, nationalities or economic differences. 2 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? Benefits are top notch. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Not always getting lunch breaks, no support during onboarding and casual colonial attitudes from middle managment. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Great for non-poc concerned about environment. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Non-stop without any support 8 am - to least 6 pm daily without breaks. Meetings would often be scheduled during any gap in your calendar leading you to have to work after hours. 2 Least diverse and most classist workplace I've experienced My region was dominated by white women from wealthy backgrounds with expensive private college degrees, often hired or promoted over more qualified applicants. My manager was obviously uncomfortable around men. The agenda of Sierra Club staff is dominated by major donors and their employees most often come from a similar background as their top donors. They mostly do AstroTurf organizing for major donors while calling it grassroots. Supposed to be for a good cause Rich people working for agenda of other rich people 2 Great mission, poor pay and work environment I was involved in writing and communications activities. I learned significantly on the job, but after I developed there was little room for upward advancement. Benefits, Mission Salary Great place for an internship in the environmental field. - Solid place to gain experience in the environmental world - A great hub to meet people in many different industries related to the environment/sustainability (i.e. engineers, salesmen, developers, politicians, conservationists, scientists, etc.) Great place Unpaid intern Great work environment with freedom to engage in issues of personal interests This job allowed me to explore issues within my community that were related to environmental racism as well as environmental degradation. A typical day at work included outreach to other professionals as well as working with community members. This allowed me to become confident working with all types of people in many different settings. The work environment was very flexible yet had many timelines that needed to be met. The hardest part of this job was working with time sensitive campaigns that needed to be met by the time of special events. I enjoyed the work environment the most because of the other professionals that appreciate the excitement of protection the environment. It's a very laid back company with lots of flexibility There is lots of scope for advancement at this company and very flexible work conditions. However, there is severe racial discrimination - mostly white people are employed who are very cliquish and unfriendly. The company needs to be working on diversifying: hiring people of other nationalities. There is also discrimination of age: only younger people are hired here totally ignoring the older applicants. Otherwise, it is a very good place to work. Friendliest and Smartest Work Environment Working at the Sierra Club was fantastic. They offered as many resources as I needed and formed clear and precise goals to be met for a genuinely good cause. They prioritize people and the environment over most things, and have strengthened their core values to include social justice. It was fun, fast-paced, and flexible. I would encourage anyone to volunteer and apply. Great place Professionalisms, goal oriented, great people, good environment, good benefits learning fast New technology Respect Trust Openness Remote work Overtime Holidays I'm a volunteer I absolutely love working here. I wish there were opportunities in the after noon. I'd love to spend more time working on the many projects that they have going on. If you're looking for an internship, this place is it! Productive and fun workplace Highly recommend Productive Fun Collaborative Very supportive Informative Community-centered Awesome work culture Challenging but fun projects Lots of independent research Fun, relaxed teaching environment Wonderful job experience engaging children in the natural world. Excellent team spirit and coworkers, warm-hearted and accommodating management. One of my favorite jobs as a college student! Upstanding Company Very interesting to work for this mature group of adults. Learned alot about New York in the environmental aspect of life. Got involved in a lot of promotions for the interest group. Helped fund for all its offices. this place is awesome A++++++ the Sierra club is filled with passionate people who care about the planet and what they do! Nothing but positives to say about this organization. productive and fun workplace I had a good time learning and working with the folks I was partnered with. They taught me a lot and gave me ample opportunities to take the lead on projects. Great time off/work-life balance. Great team. Great intentions overall, and has excellent union, and pretty solid benefits. But, old organization needs to update a lot of internal processes and strategy. Needs to diversify. Needs to pay workers more Challenging political environment A great STATE program of the Sierra Club. Through a very challenging political climate the Sierra Club North Carolina was successful in changing key legislation. Active and engaged staff and members hard-ball politics in North Carolina Field Research Volunteer - Not Employed I worked with Sierra Club on an endangered species project where we trapped, examined, and vaccinated wild animals. It was great experience and I truly felt like I was making a difference. Fun place Overall this company is a place i would let my younger friends know about and i would hope that they would be as happy as i was.. Due to school i had to leave this job but if i was able to just volunteer I would You will make money You have to walk outside Most enjoyable part of the job Getting to work with great people who truly want to make the world a better place. Management and other interns were genuine and well-educated in sustainability. unpaid internship Fun worplace This was a fun place to work because it was fun to talk to people and help sell things to people. The reason why I worked as a volunteer at the Sierra Club was because I was working with a family friend of mine. Productive and interesting It is a place where if you really want to do something serious for the Environment, you can do it and make a difference. I write articles and bots weekly on topics that motivate other people to understand that in the defense of the planet there are no colors, nationalities or economic differences. 2 Wonderful Organization The Sierra Club stands for wonderful things and has so many volunteer and internship opportunities. Everybody is extremely welcoming and your role on various volunteer committees are tailored to your personal interests. 1 2 Work that matters. There is always something to do, a goal to work toward. Work culture is caring and inviting. The work that you do matters and makes a difference but you have to give it your all. 2 1 Highly professional, passionate about issues and serving public I enjoy working with a team of very professional and friendly people who are passionate about their work and serving their communities in the interest of environmental protection, enjoyment and safety. Lovely place to work The people their are so inviting and warm very friendly, they taught me how to do phone banking and data entry. Small office but very well organized. Sad that i had to leave so soon. amazing people working towards a good cause none Good for entry level I think the work environment is friendly and good place to get some experience. There are highly experienced professionals in different skills. It was good even though the position was less that my experience and skills. It was good work envirnment No complains but the position was entry level laid back work place You typically work one on one with a manager or potentially with a community group. Task are mostly based around fundraising and community events/promotion. Very educational I worked as an intern with a very specific assignment. I performed research and comparative analysis on various topics. I found the research and the analysis to be very educational. It is what you make it. As a POC working in one of the largest non-profit organization it can be challenging but is also very awarding and filled with opportunities. Can be very autonomous at times. Manage your own time, Autonomy, Healthcare Requires a lot of time, odd hours Good Times with Great People!!! The Sierra Club is a wonderful place to work where everyone has the common goal to do what is best for the environment. I've learned time management and how to prioritize projects that were assigned to me. Management was a bit rocky as we were both new to our jobs and roles. The workplace culture was is very inviting and accepting as they are trying to progress in becoming more equitable. The best thing at my job is that we have a great work-life balance. One thing I can say that can be difficult is that the workload is very heavy for just one person. My opinion is that this is a two person job because managing the facilities aspect and also completing projects and admin work can become very stressful and frustrating. free lunch during meetings high demand very strange place to work at, culture is plain weird Not the best job I have ever had. Leadeship leaves much to be desired. Training is okay at best. Well meaning individuals. A lot of work but not challenging. A monkey could do it. good people management is disorganized Doing great work Sierra Club is doing great work in the community by educating the public about the dangers of climate change in particular and environmental degradation in general. save the planet Plenty of opportunities to work hard and feel rewarded for that work. Not much help from supervisors for some aspects of the job. Plenty of support from the public. Can be a problem on the resume as scientific or engineering firms don't want to hire advocates... great personal reward no job security can also mean low pay Sierra Club Sierra Club is not a place you want to work. Their management does not know what they are doing. Sad that a historic group like this fails to see leadership skills in qualified, experienced candidates and looks for young and inexperienced. Fun informative and fits anyones schedule Great club that teaches its members how to properly determine the quality of local waterways. As Civilian Scientists you will report your findings directly to Upper management and to the OEPA People with high moral purpose, personable, creative. I was not an employee, but a volunteer collaborating with a paid employee participating in policy initiatives related to Electric Vehicle, supporting NY State implementation of state rebates, evaluation of dealers marketing EVs in the state, electric bus studies & proposals for NYC MTA, charging network development, & other related issues. comraderie, sense of participation in change. no pathway to employment, constraints on growth of staff due to limited budget educate people about environmental issues I'm going to events on college campuses or company fairs to inform participants about volunteer opportunities, activities offered buy Sierra Club, or environmental issues. Great Place Great Place to work at. I habe been an intern there for about several months and I bave enjoyed every moment of it. I get to learn alot at the Grand Canyon Chapter of Sierra Club. Great place! This is a wonderful place to grow as a professional and as a citizen. The integrity of this organization is phenomenal. I highly recommend expanding your career with this organization! Good People The people who work for the Sierra Club are motivated individuals who care immensely about the environment. Interning there gave me many valuable skills. prod productive and is always on the go. Have a lot of events you can attend for a good cause.

Really enjoyed my experience there - all around - very fulfilling to work for such dedicated people. Help in all things IT in the operation - field and corporate. 3 1 love it It's a good place to work at. Good people to work with who are hard working and understanding. I love it here. Managers are very nice and compassionate. Co- workers 6 2 Great place to learn and grow as a professional So many great people to work with and the environment is conducive to learning. I would re commend it to anyone, especially new professionals. New experience It was my first official internship in the States and new work perspective. The employees where very helpful and friendly. all ages not much work Productive work culture I really enjoy working as an intern at this organization. Having learned many desirable skills over the course of this experience, I would encourage other college students or recent graduates to apply. Fun place to work. It is a great place to work. They are all about the environment, and they care deeply about their employees. Also, the work is very diverse. Fun workplace and felt like I made a difference My job title was community outreach and event organizer which allowed me to meet a lot of interesting people and to talk with people about environmental issues I care about. I organized phone banking and petitioning events to gather support in moving Minnesota toward cleaner energy. Productive and Place to learn something new everyday Works with the spirit to protect environment and create awareness in people in all possible ways. Innovative approaching Helpful and respectful to every co worker and welcome opinions and suggestions for every project we were doing Grassroots at its best. I absolutely loved this internship. I was able to utilize my social media skills for a worthy cause, and in turn I was able to help the PTC get renewed. During this internship I was able to stay in Austin, Texas for a week and attend SXSW ECO which was an amazing opportunity. I loved interning for the Sierra Club and hope to work with them in the future. Important work with amazing people The Sierra Club's mission and commitment to the environment make it a great place to work. Grassroots organizing and a deep & committed volunteer base make the successes possible and the obstacles manageable. Great mission, amazing people environmental issues are usually an uphill battle This Place Stinks! My co-workers were nice, and I enjoyed working beside them. Management had a much higher opinion of itself than was warranted. And that is putting it kindly. Some managers were downright incompetent. Tasks were regularly menial, tedious, and went without any appreciation. Also, the office work ethic was not very strong overall. I would only recommend this place if you are facing homelessness- and even then I would give it thought. Worked with some nice people, free coffee. Bad office politics, lazy management. Interesting Interesting, nice people, challanging outing and training courses Great organization to work or volunteer Great organization to work or volunteer. Employees and volunteers are greatly appreciated. Great organization to work or volunteer none Great place to work No organization is perfect, but working for the Sierra Club has been a tremendously rewarding experience. The staff culture is amazing; it brings selfless, passionate people together everyday. In addition, you're expected to have a healthy life outside of the office. No one is expected to slave away and work crazy hours. Overall, I would highly recommend employment at the Club. Passionate staff, great mission, good work/life balance. Pay isn't amazing, but there are great benefits. Productive and fun workplace This internship allowed me to work with the ""Beyond Coal"" campaign in Oklahoma. The campaign has been widely successful and it was interesting to work with and learn from the people that are behind lobbying for shutting the coal plants down. experience unpaid internship Excellent opportunity! Working for the Sierra Club was one of the best experiences of my career. I was allowed exclusive access to enhance my PR skills with real-life, hands-on experience. I was allowed to contribute to the national PR strategy and witness how PR is done in the workplace. Challenging work with diverse people Dedication to the environment is essential. There are ample opportunities to take the initiative and create real change. interesting and rewarding work Productive and interesting It is a place where if you really want to do something serious for the Environment, you can do it and make a difference.

Nintendo of America Inc.|" 4 stars What is the best part of working at the company? it was always like a big family everyone helping each other to get the job done What is the most stressful part about working at the company? the stressful part was probably trying to look buisy when the orders were out and we were snowed in What is the work environment and culture like at the company? comfortable What is a typical day like for you at the company? picking orders and going to help shipping and once a month inventory control but they would be pretty cool by letting us listen to music that day Excellent work environment Nintendo is a company that takes care of their employees, they have okay and benefits and really do care about their workers. The workload can be pretty heavy during peak periods with plenty of overtime, but it's a fair trade overall. 1 Good Job I truly enjoyed working for a Nintendo the only issue I had with them was the work hours and also the pay rate was very very low. Other than this I really enjoyed working with other people here and I also enjoyed the supervisors as well 2 1 The reverse of what is normally considered to be the best and worst parts of a job. I was unfortunately not happy while working at Aerotek at Nintendo. I will say that the management, recruiters and team leads were all wonderful people. But the customers...there's no way to make those people any more tolerable, sadly. Working phones for them is heinously draining. One thing to note is that while your managers can be wonderful, you are not an actual Nintendo employee and it is very obvious how low on the rungs you are considered due to that. Nice place to work if your a student. I loved working as a seasonal brand ambassador. The job is pretty straightforward and the pay is okay for the amount of work that you have to do. You will be driving ALOT for this job. No advancement opportunities. Ive been doing this job for 3 years and I am still not a full fledged employee. Pay is okay. Work as many hours as you can. No advancement opportunities, Managers are barely any help. Highly Autonomous Position Good for Entry Level Retail/Sales Was a part time (28 hours) contract position for the holiday season. Highly autonomous after the initial training and you can make your own hours as long as you get to all of your stores during the week. This is honestly the best job I ever held and was disappointed that it was only a contract position for 2 months. Ambiente de trabajo pésimo, mucho estrés y muy demandante con poca paga La compañia ha intentado esforzarse por ser la mejor, pero no logró serlo. Seguro médico privado, instalaciones privadas Siempre hay que pensar en el trabajo, no hay tiempo de descanso They can fire you for no reason Don't work for this place. There is absolutely zero job security at this job. You can be the best performer and they will still fire you just because your leadership does not like you. This is absolutely BS. Poor new management. Was a warm open environment until new management closed most cross department training and involvement. Fired around one third of full time staff in preference to disposable temporary staff. Free parking if you can find it. New management closed most cross department training and involvement, firing around one third of full time staff in preference to disposable temporary staff. Nice Perks, Terrible Leadership I'm not going to sugarcoat it - if you're considering being a contract worker, then you're better off finding a different place. The lead manager of that side is vindictive and pushy, and is the absolute stereotype of the usual corporate manager - they don't care about anything but results, and what you need is nothing to that. Communication during hiring was spotty on the best of days - I ended up waiting almost two months from my job acceptance to even /start/ training, and while that was easy and the training team was truly wonderful, we were released into the wide world... only to be told not to touch the work, because they were training another class. Then /another/ class. By the time the first touch period came around, my entire team was being told they were underperforming - and while our handlers were sympathetic (apparently, they'd overhired and knew it), my team was effectively culled in spite of being trained first and then being told to sit on our hands. It was a mess, and while I know the overhire was because they expected larger numbers as the previous season (with the release of Animal Crossing) they had underhired, it was demoralizing to be told that I was underperforming after spending two months letting cases go to training, and our training had told us one thing while practice was showing a completely different way of working. Namely, we'd been told not to touch cases that were already being handled, while management was now telling us to do just that - only that doing so would sometimes result in the cases being lost and reassigned, sometimes to someone Free Games, Great Team Environment Poor Management, Lack of Communication Great company but advancement is limited Nintendo is an industry leader and a part of every child's life and every grownup's memory so it was a dream come true to work there. However, raises and advancement are based on your entry point, regardless of actual job duties or role. Inside info on upcoming releases Compensation and advancement opportunities don't measure up to competitors Fun coworkers and product, but toxic work environment You'll learn a lot about product strategy and marketing, and have the opportunity to work with a lot of creative and passionate coworkers. The company, however, is very nitpicky and conservative. There's a lot of cross-functional work between departments. Everything has to go through Japan, which often limits creativity and prevents teams from trying anything new in terms of marketing. There is a lot of insufficient, confusing, and scattered communication. Not a lot of growth opportunities as well since most people have been there for years. Lack of learning opportunities and mentorship. No work life balance due to pressures from Japan. Lots of employees have experienced burnout. Discounted games, 401k, healthcare Low pay, small teams, burnout culture Fun But Very Independent As a Brand Ambassador you will be driving from location to location to engage with potential Nintendo customers and educating them on the features set of both software and hardware. As a contractor though, go in knowing the job is temporary and self managed. There is a support number you can call for help but other than that, you're entirely on your own. Extremely flexible schedule and good pay Independent almost to a fault Productive loved working there. I felt like I was really a part of a team and that my work was valued by my manager. It was the kind of work that I loved doing and I was able to work remotely. Free Not Company cares Overall a good company to work for. They are flexible in scheduling but the retail market is changing so it can be difficult to achieve all goals. Definitely good for work and life balance. Advancement and great pay Best company I ever worked for, I loved it. The employees are a tight group of people. The company really cares about the employees and go beyond to show loyalty. Pay and bonuses None Enjoyable and chill work environment Nintendo was one of my favorite work experiences. All the people I worked with were diverse, kind, and overall had the same interests as me so making friends was easy. I'd consider returning any time. Great environment, great people The job site is large, so getting to the cafe for lunch was often time consuming Nice People For the most part this is a good place to work but anyone with the title of Manager needs to go through serious training on how to actually be a manager. Nice Building campus in Redmond No opportunity to grow your career Overall Nintendo was a great job experience. For the time I worked there as a contract employee I enjoyed it very much especially in comparison to other temp and permanent positions I held. I miss the people more than anything thing else. Amazing company to work for This is one of the most amazing companies you could have an opportunity to work for. There is a constant sense of belonging as well as an encouraging environment. Amazing company and people! Absolutely love this position and this company. Such an incredibly opportunity that had brought so much positivity to my life. I am very thankful for my time at Nintendo! 💓 4 stars What is the best part of working at the company? it was always like a big family everyone helping each other to get the job done What is the most stressful part about working at the company? the stressful part was probably trying to look buisy when the orders were out and we were snowed in What is the work environment and culture like at the company? comfortable What is a typical day like for you at the company? picking orders and going to help shipping and once a month inventory control but they would be pretty cool by letting us listen to music that day A wondrous place to work! This was my first official job and it was the most fun I have ever had. From the people who work there to the project leads, everyone there loves Nintendo just as much as I do and that's what made it wondrous. Lots of like minded gamers and people working together to create a great product for the people out there! One thing that is important working in a gamers job is to keep your lips shut when working on a product that hasn't been released yet. Disclosure agreements and discipline are the key to Nintendo's success. If you are considering working here and are wanting to move here, I would fully encourage it! 3 Got payed to play video games I got payed to play video games with people in store isles, what more needs to be said. I had great flexibility in my schedule, got to engage with many people, and represent games I love. 1 fun workplace Very fun place to work. People there all have knowledge in the gaming world. Management cares about the employees happiness and well being. I would say if you are a gamer this is a dream job. Fun job, little pay, almost no chance for career growth and development I worked there as Video Game Tester through Aerotek for few months. Pros: It was fun job (playing game all day long). Nice and helpful people including managers. Cons: During that time they paid us just $12 per hour which felt absolutely unfair considering how much you need to know and how responsible you have to be. Workplace highly strict rules. You can't use your cellphone or any personal devices (they have special rooms for that). Even if you are late for 1-2 min, you need to mention it in your time sheet. You cannot go to your lunch without your manager / team leader voice command, etc, etc. Fun place to work I have worked for Nintendo for over 10 years and it has been good to me. I have had the opportunity to travel internationally and work with partners all over the world. Nintendo is a multi-million dollar corporation, but the branch in America is actually pretty small from an employee standpoint. This makes it hard to advance because of limited positions. It is a diverse workplace and very inclusive. Free video game rental; Soccer Field, Tickets to Mariners Games Wages are not competitive for the area Best Call Center Ever This is the kind of call center anyone should dream to work at. It is the easiest call center to work at when it comes to the actual job. The hardest part is just dealing with the schedule and the fact that often those making it don't pay attention to your needs. The managers for the most part are looking to make sure that you are not treated as a number and that there's a way for you to advance. Good company to work for. Great colleagues and team members. Great colleagues and team members. Nintendo of America was a great place to work. The people are friendly, the management is great, the benefits are okay. They pay rate is average for the area. I had opportunities to learn different skills even as a contractor. It was a great place to get entry job and get job experience. The opportunity to move to other positions is rare. I have known some co-workers that have been there 5+ years and are still contractors. If you are looking for an entry level job to gain experience, it's a great place to work. Contract job is not guarantee though. Fun and exciting job, easy to love what you do. Nintendo is an absolutely wonderful company to work for. Im only a part time brand rep but its well worth it. Compensation is very fair, and the job itself is a blast, though already being a Nintendo/ video game fan and having prior experience in a related field will make your job vastly easier and more enjoyable. Hours and schedule are very flexible and they often give you gifts and exciting products to demo. Amazing team Great colleagues and team member, emphasis on efficiency. Great transitions between different projects. There's a strive to nature talent into leadership. Productive workplace Really enjoyed my time at Nintendo. Bi-annual bonuses were very nice. I ran production and empowered a feeling of team in my time there. Although my methods were unorthodox, my results were stellar so the methods were accepted. Great company culture People here are really engaged in their jobs, and enjoy bringing smiles to peoples faces. there are regular activities to bring some fun to the work environment. employees here take pride in their work and collaborate with others to bring the best products and programs to the public company culture, great perks slow advancement Retired. This review is based on past experience. I do not have firsthand information about the current pay structure or culture/working athmosphere. I suggest applying then supply current info to help others with the process. Sweatshop They use your strength and dump you after. The first time I worked here I put in great work! I noticed the system used to persuade workers to work harder and faster. They should care more about their workers. Provide incentives. I wish they hired more employees directly instead of through contract agencies. Folks assume game testing is 'all fun and games', but it's mostly repetitive work like checklist tasks, writing reports, and responding to bug comments. Beyond that, your mileage will vary depending on who you end up working with, but most of it's pretty good. Most workers are on 11 month capped contracts. Then they have to take two months off before they can work there again. And most folk find keeping steady work there difficult for the first year or two until they are established. When a project ends, you might be just out of work for a bit. A long bit. The company itself is a great place to work There are a lot of benefits to working at Nintendo, such as a workout room, cafe, store, etc. Many of the people are a lot of fun to work with too. The biggest problem is that people are hired on in upper level positions based on seniority but then never properly trained to perform in those positions. I would say the company is great, but depending on the department there can be troubles. was production work place, teams work I can perform, my work habit in work area, and working hard, I am friendly person that can got long with people at work. I would like to lean more position Wonderful Company Culture A wonderful place to work. Great company culture and brand that care about the employees and customers. It was the best company that I have worked at in my 20 year career. Relaxing company with friendly associates Nintendo was a relaxing place to work at. As a contracted person, I did not receive great pay compared to my actual work responsibilities which consisted of confidential information and management of consumer's account. A typical day at work consisted of going over daily tasks which become repetitive and helping other associates if needed. The culture was carefree but was hard to be acknowledged by upper management. There was little to no room for advancement due to the number of associates and high turnover rates. The hardest part of the job was the inconsistent scheduling because we operate 7 days a week and days off cannot be preferred. Overall, it was a great company to learn entry-level finance skills and meeting friendly people. The food at the cafe was fantastic though. Contract work As a customer service rep, you are tasked with assisting customers on the current line of Nintendo products and any technical issues that exist. The pay wasn't very good and it's only contracted work. Advancement in the company is slim. Excellent pay and collaborative work environment My tenure at NOA was not long but the company does provide sufficient resources to be able to perform one's daily functions in an adequate fashion. The work was structured in a certain way as to be able to utilize several available resources to assist consumers with numerous types of product inquiries & issues. collaborative work environment short contract 4 stars What is the best part of working at the company? it was always like a big family everyone helping each other to get the job done What is the most stressful part about working at the company? the stressful part was probably trying to look buisy when the orders were out and we were snowed in What is the work environment and culture like at the company? comfortable What is a typical day like for you at the company? picking orders and going to help shipping and once a month inventory control but they would be pretty cool by letting us listen to music that day Great place to work. Fantastic environment and the people were amazing. Management was fantastic. Overall after a while felt like I was on an island away from my peers. Loved the position but the isolation did end up getting to me after a while. 9 Awesome place to work for Awesome place to work for. It was an honor and am grateful working for a great company. Nintendo treats their employees very well and made it an exciting, fun place to work. It was a hard decision in wanting to stay however I am at the stage in my life that I need to seek other opportunities to progress my career. Great team oriented atmosphere none 6 1 Great Entry Level Job Nintendo of America was a great place to work. The people are friendly, the management is great, the benefits are okay. The payrate is sub-par for the area. I was one of the people that was trained in a lot of different skill sets but you still get offered the same pay. You have the opportunity to learn a lot while working there even as a contractor. It was a great place to get my foot in the door in the IT world to get that experience needed to move on to something better. The opportunity to convert to a FTE is very, very rare. I've known some co-workers that have been there 5+ years and are still contractors. If you're looking for an entry level job to gain experience, it's a great place to work. If you're looking to stay there for years to try and convert to a FTE, I wouldn't recommend it. The pay is sub-par for the are and the benefits are okay and very expensive. The one major downside is not knowing when you were going to lose your job. While they do give you sick time, which is only required by WA government, the worry of losing your job was a big one. I had friends getting fired left and right for what seemed like no reason. Great people, fun place to work, nice non-health benfits healthcare, payrate Heaven for Nintendo fans and gamers alike A fun and collaborative corporate culture that focuses on long term employee retention. Dedicated to serving fans and retail partners. Singular and precise strategy to always protect the IP and only have it playable on Nintendo gaming devices and hardware. Great corporate culture, fun environment, fantastic work-life balance Extremely limited career growth, slow career progression, non-competitive compensation for a video game and technology company Relaxed and entertaining place to work The company is relaxed and fun. When you arent taking calls you can use your phone or gaming system. Free coffee pretty much everywhere and the break rooms and gaming systems for internal use. Free game codes on most big releases Moving up past CS2 is unlikely Exemplary management and culture, frugal compensation. Nintendo of America does provide a very relaxed atmosphere, competitive but still fun with some of the brightest and best in the industry. An absolute pleasure to work with them all. However they do overuse temporary contract labor, have a tendency of undervaluing talent, and have built a reputation for poor compensation. It's a company of enthusiasts and there is something to be said for that. Employees express a lot of fandom for the very products they bring to life. A steady job for beginners. If you're looking for something that doesn't require a ton of background to qualify but still depends on hard, steady, consistent work then this is the place for you. Steady workflow, fair hours Work days can change daily, no full-time guaranteed Good people bad management. I enjoyed the time I spent working at NOA, however the management seems to not know what is going on, and not really care about the associates. Of the projects I worked on I only ever stayed on one until completion, almost one of the people who work on projects are credited, often excuses would be given about management has decided to go in a new direction with the testing, or management has decided you don't fit with the team. At one point I was told I was performing tests incorrectly but was never told which tests or how I had been performing them incorrectly. Many of the lowlevel FTEs and contract workers are great to work with, The cafeteria has fairly good food for the prices, The store discount, free games and early access to games and other merchandise Poor communication from management, Hardware shortages for testing, Extremely slow processes for requisitioning extra hardware or replacement hardware, Little to no room for advancement work was okay management wasn't so great only because they just didn't care about anything that was going on during work and then scrambled to get things done. But all in all it wasn't a bad place to work. Fun first job Saying you worked at nintendo is nice but its far from a glamorous job. Be prepared to do what you are told and nothing less or more. Contract position, no benefits, no raises, no recognition. discounts on nintendo merch contract position I wish I never left As some one who grew up playing Nintendo, I loved the place. The campus offers a food court, soccer field, tennis courts and a few more amenities. worst decision I made was to leave Nintendo... really Nintendo Easy to work for and everyone was very nice. My boss was a very nice lady and was very helpful especially when I was just starting. I would highly recommend working for nintendo. Very good place to work. You will learn a lot. Good company. They cross trained so you would have an understanding of each department plus, you won't get bored. Good people. Good times. Good friends. Excellent My time here is productive and a constant learning experience. The company taught me many skills to grow and exceed expectations in my role and be comfortable outside of it as well. friendly environment and staff Unless you are a rock star... Nintendo provides pay increases & bonuses similar to Microsoft's policy of getting rid of the lower 10%. If you are in upper management, you can expect to receive high compensation & bonuses. If you are work hard, are loyal and back the company, you can expect to receive token pay increases and lower bonuses because you are not viewed as being a top performer. Asking for additional work, taking on additional responsiblities does not provide you with promotions or pay increases. You have to play political games and be in with the right people to really succeed here, which is sad. Work Life Balance, Benefits nepotism, lack of advancement Can be a fun place if you're into gaming. Nintendo can be an exciting place to work mostly because everyone has heard of it so no need to explain the company. Certain departments are better than others....however, they do run a tight ship mostly because of the parent company is based in Kyoto, Japan and their culture is very rigid. Outstanding benefits, Great company functions. Low pay, poor management, unfair work environment. Good place to work overall If you are into the video game industry there is much to like about Nintendo. At Nintendo there is a company store where you can purchase Nintendo products at a discount. Most everything at Nintendo is ""themed"" as such including the conference rooms and cafe. After work people often hang out to play video games with their fellow co-workers. The newly rebuild campus is very pleasant. As you are working in an office environment they ensure you have desks with adjustable heights, low cubicle walls to allow for collaboration, and decent laptops for everyone who uses them for work. The exterior of the campus is well kept up with walking trails, a soccer field, and basketball/tennis courts. If you love video games you will love working for Nintendo of America. Nice campus, friendly people, and plenty of ""gamer"" perks. Pay is a little lower than it is at neighboring Microsoft. It's worth any aches or pain Overall, I had a great experience at Nintendo of America from a temp agency. I enjoyed playing video games I've tested and to my surprise I enjoyed submitting bugs. At first, I thought that writing the report would dull and uninteresting. But as I become more engage with my work, the more I tend to enjoy writing up reports on what I found. It's like a game to me and I had to learn how to go by the rules of the game (employment) and it was a lot of fun. Cafeteria, 1 hr lunch, meet people, games, benefits low paying Tedious and repetitive work Working for Nintendo was good for me as a gamer... but not so much as an employee, most of the jobs offered are contract based, and if you're unlucky they can just call a meeting and tell you that your entire team is out of a job as the project you were working on has been canceled. Heckled environment, fun activities Decent entry level job, helps build experience dealing with consumers remotely via phone and email. Provides a general understanding on brand integrity. Not much opportunity for advancement. Free stuff Weak leadership 4 stars What is the best part of working at the company? it was always like a big family everyone helping each other to get the job done What is the most stressful part about working at the company? the stressful part was probably trying to look buisy when the orders were out and we were snowed in What is the work environment and culture like at the company? comfortable What is a typical day like for you at the company? picking orders and going to help shipping and once a month inventory control but they would be pretty cool by letting us listen to music that day Nope. Go in for having the name of a recognized company in your resume. Enjoy the games and the store. Do not stay for long, they know who their big fans are an will treat them as disposable peons. Pay is decent in some positions. Games. Job security, schedules. 12 2 I love Nintendo! Theres room for improvement when it comes to salary but overall an amazing company to work for. They create a fun easy going environment that I LOVE being a part of. 7 Productive attention to detail This was a tight security environment. Fun to play games. Learned computer skills and communication skills. Being part of a team is helpful and interactive. Hour lunches no benefits Fun work environment and unique break facility. It's a very casual work environment where you can go with comfortable cloth without being judged, and this is evident though the fact that there's a lot of employees who love so much this company that decide to embrace the nintendo culture by coming to work dressed up as their favorite nintendo character. Products discounts Healthcare Good opportunity Nintendo of America has a relaxing work environment. Most of the employees were very nice. The point system could use a lot of work, as I find it quite unfair for one to lose their job because their bus broke down. The Best NOA Has been the best company I have ever worked for best benefits best management i would recommend this job to anybody wanting to get a leg up in the corporate world Fun but stressful I left because of college and I could not do my contract, but when I was there the work was great but dull, you are timed for everything you do so work, bathroom, lunch, so that part was not fun. Other than that all the co-workers were great and some management were helpful too but some were not. Nintendo Management Click based roll overs. Was really excited to work for the company, put in a lot of hours with shifts that switched daily. A lot of drama between employees and managers and seemed to be about who you know in order to get rolled over full time. Non set hours, Clicks, and have to know somemone in order to be rolled over A stifling and unproductive place to work The way people are treated and the environment displays just how disposable employees are to NOA. There is no reason to work here past the initial excitement of working for a well known game company for most. Small discount on purchases at company store Cramped work space, Rude coordinators, juvenile environment, poor work availability, poor healthcare Cool environment but with zero job security for lowly contract-workforce A contract here dissolves any rose-tinted glasses one may have for the dream of working at Nintendo. To put it briefly, contracting here is cut-throat. If work runs dry, you and your team are axed with less than a day's notice. There isn't much room for any advancement from contractor to full time, and I felt there was segregation of the contractors (in the old NoA offices) and full timers (in the new glass building). You get a bit of a discount at the Nintendo Store, which is a pretty cool place. But beyond getting food from the main office (which is very good for the costs), there wasn't much to look forward to. As mentioned, the job security was so thin, you kept your desk sparse in preparation of being told not to come in tomorrow. cool environment, enthusiastic co-workers, free coffee no job security, strict hours, queue type workloads Absolutely loved it I loved Nintendo and my co-workers. I simply chose to move back home. Everything about my work experience at Nintendo was positive and loved everyone there. It's Nintendo, gamers dream job None Productive and fun workplace My typical day was working 10 hours a day sometime with overtime. I learned to do different kind of work in the department.The management was professional, friendly and accommodating. The hardest part of the job was being able to reach the quota that the department required. The most enjoyable part of the job was free parking, receiving mid year and end year bonus and having two weeks vacation in December paid by the company. Being able to play free Nintendo games Customer Service Rep Customer service via telephone assisting customers with various Nintendo platforms, gaming consoles, devices, software and internet applications as well as sales. It's Nintendo! I worked remote, out of state. Got left along probably too much, as I really needed input and feedback from engineers. They seemed to have other priorities but it was ok as a quick contract. I wish I could say something about working for Nintendo Unfortunately, everything I did there was under some extreme NDA. It was a wonderfully laid back environment though. I thoroughly enjoyed working for them and would love to go back for another round of it. No future, far away Didn't see myself having a future, too long of a commute (1 hour and a half without traffic, 2-4 hours with traffic) The constant repitition didn't mix well with my depression. A very cool job It's easiest to work at Nintendo of America in Kirkland if you apply through the staffing company called Aerotek. Other than the bad pay, this is a great job. The hours are very manageable (8 hour shifts). You will work either in Technical Services or material management. Technical Services is mentally demanding and material management is a bit physical. Both entry level positions are stressful but the work seems meaningful and the shifts go by without fail. It's a nice place to work day in and day out. Don't get too comfortable here however because your position is not a permanent one. Aerotek is kind of an evil company and they will lay off their staff regularly in order to avoid having to provide any sort of benefits. Many employees return regularly despite the regular layoffs. If you have no cost of living it works; this is really the ideal job for someone living in their mother's basement. Working at Nintendo is very cool because you are working at a Nintendo Factory. Even though you are not producing any of the hardware you will package or repackage Nintendo systems and games and controllers and such which can be very fun or you will troubleshoot and test for issues in software or hardware. Both jobs are fun enough for paid work that is regular and during normal waking hours. Aerotek are willing to train/hire anyone which is also great if you have no relevant work experience. A terrific place to work if you are a young or retired. working at Nintendo of America actually working for Aerotek Working with a Class A company Working with Nintendo was a wonderful experience. They had the patience to teach me what I didn't know and allowed me to use it everyday. Great atmosphere, a wonderful team to work with. Very loyal to their employees, offered a great benefits package, and were eager for it's employees to excel in their careers within the company. A typical work day was very busy. Lots of phone calls, several changing deadlines, changing meetings and schedules, expense reports, requisitions, action memos, travel, agendas. Always kept me on my toes, and in all honesty,I wouldn't want it any other way. This is how you learn. We were given a free copy of every game and console launch I have none. My favorite position. Fun, Hip place to work took inbound calls, helped troubleshoot consumer issues, noting all incidents taken within the day. Fun place to work at with great perks but as an contracted associate job security is minimum due to agent metric evaluations. fun environment no job security Fun place with games to play The job was fairly easy. during our break we had the option to play video games in the game room. The most enjoyable part of this job was the employees. Free games to play durng break Long stanind periods 4 stars What is the best part of working at the company? it was always like a big family everyone helping each other to get the job done What is the most stressful part about working at the company? the stressful part was probably trying to look buisy when the orders were out and we were snowed in What is the work environment and culture like at the company? comfortable What is a typical day like for you at the company? picking orders and going to help shipping and once a month inventory control but they would be pretty cool by letting us listen to music that day Good work/life balance at a relaxed pace It's a comfortable and friendly place to work, but don't expect to make enough to realistically live in the area without a second job. Still, it's good to have a product and company that you care about that operates ethically. Cheap lunches, discounts at the store Low salary, few benefits, no paid time off 4 Too Demanding I managed a 24x7 365 days a week position responsible for all Nintendo computer systems. I had 8 employees. I wore a pager, had a work cell phone and was on call 24x7 365 days. My staff had to call me nearly every night to get my input on systems errors. No matter how many middle of the night calls I got, I was still expected to put in my 8 hours physically at work which included starting at 8am and ready for a management meeting by 8:30 with an explanation for all the calls I received. The only way my employees could have a day off, such as Christmas, I have to sign in from home hourly and check on all the systems. It just became too much! good pay and great deals on their products high stress 2 1 I love it I love working at Nintendo because everyone getting along very well, they dont jealous of other people succeed. People are willing to help each other with the job Temp agency The staff at the Nintendo site are understand and straight forward. They will work with you if you are willing to work with them. A lot of their views align with the moral compass. If you are willing to put forth the effort they will work with you to keep you working as long as possible Flex hours, Bonus work for those who show willingness 8 months work only Not really sure The customer service aspect of the job was okay, As far as work, the job was stressful and sometimes confusing due to management not taking the time to update us on new information. work day ping pong tables , good atmosphere ,lots of lifting and stacking., a lot of moving around loading 7-12 trucks daily during non- peck season.somewhat more freedom to oversea yourself. liked my co-workers injuries FUN is the best word I can describe working for NOA Always a busy day for me all week. I love working in Nintendo despite the low pay it is something that I really love doing.I have gained knowledge and get to meet a lot of cool and amazing people. Productive and fun workplace I loved working at Nintendo. It was a fun and productive workplace and it was fairly easy to show your productivity. The discounts on repairs to systems were great. I enjoyed my time with Nintendo A typical work day entailed going to the different stores on my route to make sure they were up to date on the newest Nintendo marketing and information. I learned how to be more outgoing since I had to approach people on a daily basis to ensure they were knowledgeable about Nintendo's newest games and systems. The hardest part of the job was making sure I had enough room in my car to fit all of the marketing we had to place in the different accounts. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to meet new people on a daily basis. Fantastic employer Nintendo of America has excellent benefits and a fun environment. Challenges include coordination with the parent company and organizational inertia due to many long-term employees. Benefits, environment, rewarding work High stress Great place to have fun and meet people interested in the same thing as you. The best part of any job are the people, and Nintendo of America has great people. It's not as crazy as other game related places and you get your own space per project. It feels much more relaxed and I feel motived to actually go and work. I have never been able to relate to other people as well as I have related to the friends I've made there. great job loved corporate training and benefits this was a merchandising position with about 100 mile circumference of San Antonio. I rotated stock, applied signage, took inventory, repaired game machines, cleaned my area. I loved seeing my area in a mess on arrival, then all stocked, signed and clean when finished. The difficulty was driving so far between stores ther were many 12 hour non stop days. With a handicapped son it was hard to find and pay for flexible in home trained caregivers free Nintendo items and merchandising T-Shirts, posters games, etc. Wonderful corporate convention at DisneyWorld long drives, long days. Hard to schedule required stops A temporary job that had taught me the importance of A typical day at work was usually spent completing monotonous tasks such as refurbishing and building products. A few months into the job and I began as a supervisor over the X Ray Division, managed schedules of coworkers, filling empty time slots etc. Good environment, interesting projects Anyone interested in localization would do well to begin here, and there is the possibility of making a career over the course of time. Work-mates are generally competent and helpful, managers are good, and the projects well organized. Relaxed professional workplace I signed an NDA so I can't go into specifics but the atmosphere was very relaxed and welcoming. Break rooms were spacious, clean, and provided game systems to play on breaks. Cafeteria with great food, games in break rooms, fun coworkers The position I did was a short term contract work working there was terrible standing all day with barely any breaks. managers are rude. terrible environment to be in. your never good enough no matter how good you do Advancement opportunities almost zero Hiring for the ""Product Testing"" position almost never happens, with the department made almost entirely of contract employees that gain no raises, are given no benefits, are whose contracts are guaranteed to end at least once a year. Very few opportunities to transfer out of Product Testing into any other role at the company. Good company busy work but valued employees. A little bit micromanagement; manager helps; work life balance; good perks; hard to career growth because people stay long time Good pay and benefits Culture productive and fun place to work for Good place to work, food available if hungry. Everyone is nice , the managing is good. the culture of the work environment is better then a lot of other place I have been at. It was production work I feel that even though this was production work, the people I got to meet and work directly played a huge roll in liking the job. Had those people not have been there I don't think I would have made it last as long"

Great Circle Summary Great Circle offered a great learning experience and had just enough work to keep me busy while still being able to learn. The only downsides are the stresses of working with the kids there, most of the time they were behaved, but not always. Typical production factory Typical workday is kinda boring depending on the machine you get for the day. I learned how to run a hydraulic paper punch machine Management is decent I'd say. your typical management guys. The culture is more lax but also focused. you get the few jokesters but that's pretty typical i'd say. The hardest part of the job would be looking for the right sized skids for some of the machines because they are odd specs. a lot of the time you're making a skid out of the ones you have which takes up time you could be running the machine The most enjoyable part I'd have to say is the benefits. They have really good benefits and just before I left they had some pretty cool new healthcare plans. benefits, pretty easy jobs I would not work here again The workplace is full of rumors about other people as well as yourself and everyone is always looking to backstab everyone else and do as little work as possible in the store or heave work onto other people to do. food all around you to eat volatile workplace Nice and fast paced I would always work the 2nd shift which seemed to be the busiest. Lunch time and around the time every one gets off from work and are headed home. Each day wasn't predicted but you had an idea of what you had to do. No breaks, pay isn't the best. Work Had friendly coworkers. They cooperated better than I expected when it came to certain tasks at Circle K. All jobs have some issues, but we mainly settled them out in a orderly and respectful attitude. Free Beverages after the first purchase Seniority Customer service The job Rose customer paste it was very enjoyable to interact with the customers. Depending on the season you could be very busy or extremely slow especially in a small town like Pine Mountain the work was relatively easy as long as you could count you could do it recommend keep a smile on your face Fun work place You meet a lot of new people,fun place to work.

Very fun place to work definitely recommend to work there. Discount meals . The drive Fun Place to work Working and Circle B's was an experience to me. Providing product through a window was new to me. Protecting product loss was difficult because there were many people that frequented the place and there was no security. Pay weekly No security A job is what you make it... I been there for about 4 years and i reall think that they can work one a lot of thing.this job is what you make of it, it can be fun at timesi loved to working there.. You will jave to pay for everythig.. You get a 10min and 30 min break.. it was a volunteer job it was fun to raise puppies and it was an amazing experience. we still take in puppies every once and a while. The love you get from the fosters is completely worth it. puppies its messy normal day The store was 24 hours so i would come in at 5 and start doing the safe counts and balancing the day before paperwork and day. worked with vendors. hired trained put up new sales. had weekends off if someone called out you worked Great Job Great job, easy working environment. Family owned buisiness. Hours were not aweful, however I wish I could have gotten more. While working there, you have to know that there son and daughter will get special treatment and most of the hours, however you get used to it. Great Great place to work if you have a good sense of humor and are personable! This job if you're doing it right, will get you into shape because you need to be quick about your tasks between the ever flowing line of customers. newly company still have more to develop, safety on the job perhaps , among with staff management , but with the right people and the right set of mind anything can be achieved not a job i would recommend to a friend The company doesn't care anything about its employees, they hire out side to company for promotions and no support for current working employees. Paying employees minimum wage you will get minimum workers. Fun place to work for. Dealing with co-workers isn't easy here. Supervisor seems nice but doesn't communicate well. Hardest part of this job is working with the supervisor. The most enjoyable part of the job is doing the work itself. Good pay and have room for advancement Just don't know where and when the next job will be construction/ cleaning great company, friendly environment. great salary. great hours and overtime included. For the time I worked there, the salary was well above the regular pay for similar employment elsewhere. Fun workplace Exciting workplace. Always busy and very demanding. Management and co - workers were amazing. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers. I've never encountered better customers. The hardest part of the job was trying to coincide the job task. There was a lot to do each day from making sure the shelves were stocked to cashing out customers. impressive work being accomplished This is a non profit organization that assists woman and children escaping from domestic violence. I run the Shelter. The responsibilities include the physical running of the house, ordering, scheduling safety inspections etc. I do the intake paperwork of all guests, & their children. I assist the women in their housing search, financial issues, finding new physicians, drug and alcohol counseling, therapist searches etc. I help them navigate the legal systems, work with DCF & DOC if necessary. I help guide the ladies back to independence & give them hope for brighter futures. I also assist in the hiring process. My co- workers are awesome! The hardest part of the job is leaving it at work. We are on call for 24 hours at a time and this is disruptive to our family life. The money we are paid does not represent the volume of work we do. Nor does it compensate when having to work the 24 hour shifts. I would have considered staying if the compensation was appropriate and we were not short staffed all the time. The best part of my job is helping those who are ready to be helped! It is incredible to witness the growth in people when they realize they can accomplish what ever they set out to do! Working with people. We are not micromanaged pay Loved my job and the people I worked with. Great place to work. Enjoyed staff and my manager. Already was a sales manager at my old job so I tried to help where needed and increase sales. Kept the store clean and stocked. Waited on customers in a timely friendly manner. Worked with some people I already knew from my old job. Worked with out breaks when extremly bussy. Very intervative Company Very interactive Company. We handling festivals, conventions. My co-workers are great people. I am used to more procedures. Great Co-Workers Keeping busy with both customers and running the store. I worked with great people who were fun and hard workers. Cleaning and stocking the products. Speaking with vendors on issues with products or about new products. Keeping busy When the system network would crash Excellent place to work I really love working for Circle Housing Russet. The role I do is very diverse and no two days are ever the same. I have learnt a lot over the time at Circle and this has given me a wealth of knowledge to take forward in my career. I work with a number of departments, teams and contractors and have a great working relationship with them. The team I work in is fantastic, they are extremely helpful and supportive, you couldn't ask for a better team to work within. We always go the extra mile for our customers and each other. The management are great and supportive and approachable. The company is very much about putting the customer at the heart of everything they do, this is why I enjoy my role, as I love working with our residents and supporting them to make positive changes in their lives. Seeing these fantastic life changes are so rewarding, it gives great job satisfaction. The hardest part is lack of staff and not having enough time to spend with residents at times, and not having time to type notes and letters within a quick timescale after meetings, as other priorities take over. The caseload is high, which is good but less would allow more efficiency. Excellent company to work for, work life balance, excellent values High workload, means less time to spend with residents and getting involved with supporting them more. Very Good Environment It has a very good work environment. The employees and manager and the overall company is absolutely amazing. Exciting young company They are a sports and entertainment brokerage that does business with NBA and NFL clients. Their events are great fun and the day to day business is very informative. I learned alot there and blame them for my wide knowledge base. Productive, always something to do Close family environment, ready to help clients and catering to customers' wants and needs. Free healthcare, always having great birthday lunches and very festive during the holidays It was a great experience for me to work here was fun. I would definitely work for this company again.

Not a lot of projects, if there is an interesting one, it go to the same operators and techs, new hires dont train on good projects, they inventory broken equipment and stuff. Pay is way lower than nearby companies, new people get hired in at higher pay than people who been there for 10yrs or more, No real chance for advancement, 50yr old equipment, that mostly really was fished outta the dumpster from the nearby corps, and 70 year old facilities that need major update, Management seeems clueless not able to fix the probs, and senior management is never even around. Can take a 4-hour lunch break and nobody will know, since managers are never there and its non-profit What little work there is is boring, Cant even make new friends cuz people hire in and then quit in a few months Opportunity to advance Friendly environment.

BAE Systems|" Stepping stone There are a stepping stone and they know it. They don't pay nearly as much as the industry standard. The culture is pretty toxic. Definitely pits employees against each other to see any success. Stay away A typical day at work is working long hours with no additional compensation. Most enjoyable part of the job is going home. Benefits were competitive to other companies. Fine, but low pay Can't compete salary wise with local competition. People in NH get paid more than us even though our cost of living is the same and only getting more expensive. 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Opportunity to obtain experience in varying roles within organization. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Transitions with personnel What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Diversified and inclusive What is a typical day like for you at the company? Multi tasking, fast paced, challenging tasks rewarding Great place to work I've been here for 5 years and still love it here.

Not sure there is a best part it’s just work What is the most stressful part about working at the company? The inability to manage and communicate across the board What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Very very toxic What is a typical day like for you at the company? Like being in a prison camp Great place to work Great place to work at people are friendly and helpful. Pay rate is above average. Close to home dont have to drive too far. I enjoy the working environment easy going not too much pressure. Vacation and sick time is good also. I enjoy my job and working a four day work week 10 hour days. Eh, it's okay if you want to be stagnant Work is relatively simple and easily performed. Management communication is severely lacking and advancement is nearly impossible unless you have ""an in."" It's a boys' club and they do not like it when you point out their mistakes or how things could be improved. Maintain the status quo and you'll be just fine. Benefits, PTO and job security. Advancement, communication and consistency. Flexible but Underpaid Managers are really considerate about your time, they allow you to shift around hours throughout the week. There is no real opportunity for overtime, so you are stuck working about 40hrs a wee unless you can get it approved a week or two in advance. Pay increases are about 1 to 3% and you will be paid 25% less than the national average. Benefits are sub-par, so hurts more to be paid even less. Work is stressful if you are proactive, will always have things to do. 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? The team is awesome. Great working environment. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Don’t think there is any What is the work environment and culture like at the company?

Great alternative Possibilities and/or opportunity think, do, and /or to choose differently. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Present moment self regulating state of mind and being. Depends on who and where you work at BAE Not impressed. Lots of managers who did not have skills to manage people. There was a good bit of nepotism in the department I worked in. This company could do a better job of hiring quality management. Electronic systems division San Diego is toxic with high turnover The small program I was on at electronic systems had a person leave every 2-three months. They could not keep people. Reasons were misleading interviews, terrible toxic chief engineer, revolving management, overbearing policies, forced constant travel, crushing workload. Each division is run like a kingdom . Decent benefits Chief engineer, Red tape, slow promotions, toxic people people do what they want and sit around alot. Most horrible job place I ever worked at people come and go when they fell like it, we need to have supervisors to keep track of workers and take long breaks without punching out. 4 10 hour days people really hate their jobs and sit around and complain. Wiring electrical cabinets Working at BAE in the test best shop is a good place to work if you are a beginner or want to learn about electric and electronics. Good foot in the door Good work bad people The work is physical labor but not hard. It's the people who make it hard. The politics of being in a corporate/government environment is the same every where you go Flexible work schedule In-house, flex-time, and work from home options. Every other Friday off. Multiple locations around the US to work and travel Tremendous promotion opportunities and bonuses Women are treated extremely unfair Turn over is terrible. They don't want to give the union a fair contract but all salary positions doubled. Women are not equal. They do nothing for single mothers or help there employees unless you've been there for 15- 20 years. Good pay Women are treated unfair especially when they work harder then most men. Good work life balance Pay is good in my area. Management treats everyone with respect. BAE puts safety before everything else. Insurance is a little on pricey side, but coverage is decent. Stepping stone There are a stepping stone and they know it. They don't pay nearly as much as the industry standard. The culture is pretty toxic. Definitely pits employees against each other to see any success. Great work, great product Unfortunately I did not enjoy my time with this orginzation. As always there were some exceptional people. High turn over means lots of career opportunities. I wish them well. 1 Training and development issues Bae systems needs to seriously take a round turn with management training and a clearer ascension to move up within the company. Craft personnel and superintendents aren't given enough training once hired in the company. was great at one time Once the Endicott/Johnson City got rolled under the headquarters out of NH many peoples' outlook and moral really went downhill. There's a great deal of condescension that comes from leadership and colleagues in the NH area. It's a shame because it was such a great place to work before that happened. There is a concerted effort by the headquarters to keep all control there, which can be fine, but it's done in a way that is very negative and hurts the overall goals of many efforts there. Managers have terrible attitude towards hourly Salary and hourly treated very differently. Weak leadership from the top down. Supervisors rarely have a clue about what is going on in their departments, and continue to do operations that result in poor quality. Good pay though - gov’t contract work. Even if the place is sparkling and you work hard; the manager always finds something wrong, ex: you didn’t pick up that ant. 100% negative. Disorganized management, lack of leadership…and so on. Just do your job and go home. As an ABM employee working in any industry, the company does not have that approach to simple say “thank you “ to any employee. At best, one will probably get a hi. You are just a cog The title pretty much says it all. The company strips benefits annually. Expects you to work 11 hour days plus weekends and gets angry with you when you are unable to do this even if it’s just for a single day. Employer would constantly ask why you need time off and if it was for something they didn’t see as recruiting a day off (I.E your daughters 4th birthday) they would ridicule you for it. The company is filled to the brim with workaholics that have miserable home lives and they expect every single person coming into the company to adopt that way of living. I legitimately started to bald from the stress of this job and now that I haven’t been there for 3 months my hair is almost fully grown back. Absolutely the worst job I’ve ever had the displeasure of being at. 3 years of my life completely wasted. Built in the 1940’s, Ran by incompetent engineers One of the “best jobs in the area” for locals but you are picked at random for which department you get places in regardless of previous skills or experience. No moving between departments and some departments shovel and move boxes manually for 8-10 hours per shift in buildings that have no A/C. Safety is never first regardless of what is said by management and production rates are always increased regardless of constraints. I hope I never darken the doors of HAAP again! Work/life balance was fair During COVID production slowed down and there wasn’t much work like everywhere else. Didn’t feel productive. 1000’s of people in the sky are depending on your work. They want to fly safely. Do your best because you will get audits. Vacation+ sick days were the best! Hard dirty work, good pay, corrupt management Good place to work if you care to do the political dance with the higher ups. They have so many safety rules that it impedes getting done. Your good ideas will be stolen and claimed by others and your hard work will be credited to your immediate boss. If you are okay with that it's an okay place to work. Good pay Just told you above CDL A Truck Driver Management Sucks. Unorganized organization. Pay is average. Culture of employees is very cut throat. Resigning from this revolting company as soon as I find another position. Avoid working here unless you’re homeless. Management see little value in people Management plays favorites until work needs to be done. Then they need the actual qualified people. Some people didn’t have the slightest clue how to do there job. Yet were hired. cool place to grow It's okay for what you need. the website for employees is kinda antiquated but its okay for its purpose. try to grow and you might learn a lot. take that experience to other opportunities A satisfying job I like working here like the benefits and the hours are always set. You get a paid floating holiday every year Hard to find parking unless you're a journeyman or above you don't get a parking place but you can't be shuttled all the way from the Hilton hotel back to work but that always takes time out of your day and you're not clocked in for that Management is very poor Honesty is very lacking, management and other employee were controlling and demeaning. There is no where to go for help, no support, training is sporadic and minimum, the overall attitude is demoralising. Extremely BAD Company to be in at any given time, day or night. management in-charge of nctams navy contract building 409 practice and preach Favoritism, no accountability, will retaliate against you if you report them. management will threaten you with a bad write up on performance review and reduce your merit increase if you don't do as you are told. No decent work dress attire you can come to work looking like a bum and smelling like a bum that needs a shower. employees come to work late more times than on time and nothing is done about it. management at this location will green light the bad behavior and try punishing employees that come to work on time, in proper dress and showered. poor performing employees will not be following policies and procedures and do whatever they want to do, management ignores this bad behavior and allow them to do whatever they want, both managers which they are not should have already been fired along with the human resource representative located in Cailfornia. It's a good place to work I love working there I've been there for 15 years I made a lot of money working there six seven days a week overtime I thank God for being there I learned a lot throughout the years being there welding pipe fitting ship fitting cleaning the ship from top to bottom It was a blessing to be there Productive Productive place to work depending on department. Warehouse workers always get 40 hours and more overtime than production floor. The safety culture is getting better than when I started and the management team is pretty good but it depends on who you ask. Good place to work It was a good place to work and good people to work with but you have to take and learn the job as you go not the best training program. Pay is ok but could be a lot better but they keep a good work load so layoffs is not a problems Bad managent, limited opportunity Been working here for a long time. Management is horrible, no 360 reviews to highlight the problem. No opportunities to advance if you look a certain way due to the current focus on DEI and NOT capability. A lot of nepotism and favoritism. Its changed a lot over the years...time to move on. Fun Tech but not for young people Young college grads beware: you will have to learn everything here on your own. Most older engineers don’t have the patience or time to help younger employees out. You will be doing grunt work for many years with little increase in pay or responsibilities unless you move around departments to expose yourself to different projects. Corporate bureaucracy and politics everywhere. Great company and work products, but you can only get respect from peers if you are a senior engineer or higher. Stepping stone There are a stepping stone and they know it. They don't pay nearly as much as the industry standard. The culture is pretty toxic. Definitely pits employees against each other to see any success. The good is the pay and benefits,the bad is the hours and the length of work. This job is not for everyone hot,dirty, very confined spaces,it takes a lot out of you not to many people last you get old very fast. I guess the pay what makes you do it. 1 Fun Job, Fast Turnover, & Invasive Upper Management If you like: -Troubleshooting tanks -Working with interesting people -Always being busy -Covering weekends -Being told to monitor your phone on off-shifts -Travel rotations -Justifying your existence to management thru a Jira ticket system -Watching good friends get laid off -Seeing half the team leave/quit over the course of a year -Having upper management refuse to replace lost team members Then this is the job for you 1 2 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Good pay for my position and the ability to get a job based on my experience whether or not I have a degree. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? The managers seem to play favorites and will come down really hard on one employee for seemingly no reason. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Stressful and rewarding but the fact that most managers seem to throw you under the bus in order get a step ahead is worrying. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Just like any other desk job 4 stars What is the best part of working at the company? The opportunity to grow with the company. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? The importance of the work and the amount of work to complete. Focused and productive planning I started at BAE with a sophisticated suspension project. There was always help available and I was free to complete my tasks with minimal interruptions. The managers were accessible and communicative. good place to work with good leadership BAE Ship Repair is a good place to work, very focused on safety, work quality. The culture for a shipyard is very inclusive and they take pride in welcoming anyone who is will to work. If it was not for the low pay I would never look to leave. Great place Great leadership very helpful and pay is great .I was Deployed to Afghanistan. Upon exiting due to military evacuation many Afghans who supported our efforts were left behind. American (Pennsylvania) office was not ideal. The pay raise, if you want to call it that was a joke. It was not a percentage of your pay, it was literally pennies. I think one year I received .25 cents, that was with a 4/5 rating. The year after It was .10 cents. This was normal, I spoke to numerous of my coworkers and they reported similar raises. They would not promote from within, and if they did, they (upper management) would tell their favorite employees which jobs were posting, so they could apply and then send out the email to the rest of the employees. I will say this, the reason I stayed is because I truly liked my teammates and the flex scheduling was very nice. Those are the only reasons, needless to say 3 years was way too long. I missed out on so much more money by staying. Culture is terrible They let poor performers waste government money and they don't know how to be get out of their own way. They do a great job at creating obstacles for themselves. The position you hire in at may not match your skills in favor or against. They will never look to correct it, or give ANY promotions. Get experience and leave fast Good work life balance. Mind numbingly boring work but easy if you don't care. Managers don't care, you won't be trained but none of it is that hard. You play second fiddle. Easy Sucks Great place to blend in Being able to see the fruits of your labor with local customers makes the job worthwhile. Being a large corporation does put some distance between employees and management, but immediate supervisors are readily available. Good place to work with all new innovations regarding the satellite system. I’ve been working in satellite business for more than 15 years and the satellite business will growing due to demands as the technology keeps getting updated every year. Commuting to and back is a little overwhelming It’s nice to work with knowledgeable people. Lots of promises Not as easy to grow as they have you believe. If you play the political game you'll advance. People promoted to roles they shouldn't be in while those better suited are kept lower level. Very slow and easy place to work, but come with the price. Each year you will get really low of cost of living raise from 1-1.75% get 3% if you are super lucky or you are new bee. Not willing to give promotion, even if you get one the raise could be even less than cost of living raise. For what I have observed, BAE pays the lowest compare to similar industries, you see your former coworkers end up working at Boeing, NG, LM,etc. Easy job and management won't care if you don't work because someone would do it. Low pay, low raise, no developments Coworkers are close, management is clueless People tend to get along for the most part. Immediate supervisors seem to care, but upper management tends to be clueless. Can never seem to get it together. Pay is good but benefits suck. Cigna insurance is a joke. Good pay No job security Professional but Not Stuffy The team was professional, but did not get in an uproar over the little things. Get the job done was the important thing, without impact to family life. Tons of work to keep you busy. Heavy policy and procedures due to ISO Certifications Overall not a bad place to work. Allows work from home and hybrid options for a lot of positions. Management is overall good. Slow promotion potential due large number of people in same positions. Cool work Overwhelming amount of paperwork Good place to have a career This is a good place to work and Stay for a very long time (retirement). There are chances for advancement, but sometimes good employees get stuck because supervisors don't want to give them up. Come here for the culture The culture is the best thing about BAE, and you are expected to accept lower pay and horrible benefits in exchange for that culture. Depending on what your priorities are, it may be worth it to you. It's nice to work with nice people. Excellent Job Through my years working at BAE Systems I just have positive things to say about this company. Job security. Benefits and pay rate are very good! Excellent company to work for. Benefits, Pay Rate None Stepping stone There are a stepping stone and they know it. They don't pay nearly as much as the industry standard. The culture is pretty toxic. Definitely pits employees against each other to see any success. Union Shop Bae Systems is a Unions shop. Basically last end 1st out. They have layofffs niw and then. I was apart of the last one 38 were let go. Like anywhere you have good Managers and you have .... yeah. The pay was good benfits okay. Union was a lil to friendly with Management. Depending on the department worklife pretty good. Stress It's all about hitting the mark fall short and you will know. The stress is not worth it. When new management comes in be prepared to grasp at straws to keep your job. If your not liked from the moment they meet you it's pretty well guaranteed you will be looking for a new job. None Everything 1 Productive and Fun I love the fact that I can protect someone. I love working on the ship. I love being productive, Clean and tidy. I hate that it can be risky. We ate working on water and you have to take precautions. I love working as a team. Sometimes the Hours can be exhausting. Great overtime Risky. Fair and lots of work plenty of overtime. I really enjoy working there...Very family-oriented—plenty of time off. Great work schedule. When you need to take care of family they really understand. 4 day work week and plenty of overtime none Poor pay for what you do If your looking for health benefits this is the place. If you like to be lazy at work this is the place. Horrible pay and no reason to work hard because people make more then you and do less then you. They don't care what you do they just want body there 4 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Laid back and easy. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? The coworkers like drama. No need to worry about poor performance They'll hire anyone and almost refuse to fire someone who quite literally can't follow written instructions. Management is jumping ship left and right. The management that's staying does not want to help employees find a path to grow and learn within the company. Hiring more bodies is more important than realizing that there's already too many technicians for the lack of work. nice place to work, 2nd shift pay lunchtime and grate benefits good place for retirement and good benefits, almost free. nice place to work and stay long time and good 401K matchin, up to 6%, medical insurance is one of the best in town, to much to mention, best place to work, good pay if you are a welder or fitter 2nd shift pay for lunchtime no cons Productive and great place to work Great place to work, the employees are easy to communicate with, the pay rate is great, safety is the main priority, training on other machines, and the work hours are great. The opportunity to move up is their if you want to. Good place to work I've been here 6 months in the Receiving/Inspection department and so far things have been going well. I was given thorough training for my position and treated well buly my department manager and co-workers. The pay is above average for the job duties, in my opinion. Benefits are pretty good, as they give you generous PTO from the the start and offer a great 401k company match. Overall, this seems like a good place to work. Good pay, good 401k match, generous PTO Limited opportunities for advancement, depending on your position At one time it was a great place to work. Who knows if BAE will be running it after the recompete is over and this may be a good thing. At one time it was a great place to work before new operations manager and production managers were put in place. Now there is a clear lack of knowledge in management and their indecisiveness has killed morale due to no decision being mad or bad decisions being made. I’ve never worked at a place that would allow 25% of the workforce leave before starting the hiring process and analyzing reorganizations that were made. Keep looking while this management is in place it will only get worse. Good pay They pay well. That’s the only benefit. Mediocre engineers who think they know everything just because they’ve been there a while. Poor leadership, and no one bothers to get to know other people, we are all just coworkers. The mission to support the war fighter Management make an effort to develop an inclusive environment and encourages collaboration both within and between departments. The company restructures frequently which can be very unsettling. Good place to work if you don't mind the politics. This company takes a percentage of your raise and gives it to lesser performing employees to move them up the pay scale instead of fully rewarding you and then tell you that is exactly what they did. Sort of like living in a socialist society. Time off is ample. Rewards poor performance over good performance thus lowering morale. Overall good Overall it was a pleasure working there Sometime you did not get the credit for the work you did it give to others but overall it was respected I feel I did my work at a high level all my work was complete ahead of time Sounds good until you’re there. This company is veteran focused. There is almost no room for advancement especially for new hires within the first 1-2 years. Prior experience needed to advance. Was given more opportunities with the possibility of travel but these types of jobs are not guaranteed. Contracts can be taken at any moment and furlough based on workflow is a possibility. Good place for busy work but do not expect advancement especially if only civilian. Extremely Hostile and Toxic Environment HR sides with management only, good luck ever bringing up any major ethical violations.. you will be retaliated against. Everyone says it is a team environment but people sabatoge eachother even if they are not even in your work group. Find another place to work. Great to grating. Worked here for 15 years. Covid policies and woke culture has mostly ruined what was a great place to work. Take time from your busy schedule to attend a townhall meeting and have it wasted listening to recommendations on books to deal with your being white. A defense company that ""Protects those who protect us"" However, can't get the tattered flag that needs to be replaced to half mast after losing 13 troops in the Afghan retreat, but can manage to get a flavor of the month virtue signaling flag on the pole reliably. A business that spends a lot of time reinforcing threats at work will not be tolerated, but if there is money to be made and it's crunch time; will allow it. Employees are punished for ""covid policy violations"" however take a walk through support staff areas and take notice of the lack of enforcement for salaried employees. This company will not stand up for your personal healthcare decisions. You can do better. Productive and fun company where I learned alot. BAE was a good first job out of college. I learned a lot from senior management about the industry. You get to work on complex jobs which can be tough. One of the best contracting companies I have worked for I've enjoyed working for BAE. They have a wide range of contracts and capabilities supporting the military and government agencies, worldwide. I started with BAE on a 3-year contract, when that ended, I didn't have any luck finding another position to stay with them. A few years later though, I was contacted by a BAE manager about another position and took it. I've been with them almost 10 years now. The PM's I have had were all very good in looking out for you and helping you with anything you need. My current contract is coming to an end, and I hope to find another contract I can get on to stay with BAE, but if not, I hope to return down the road should an opportunity arise. Pros: Management looks out for you, good advancement, and pay is better than most other government contracting companies. Cons: Sometimes when you are on a contract at a client site, you may be the only BAE person there, so sometimes it kind of feels like you aren't part of the company. Stepping stone There are a stepping stone and they know it. They don't pay nearly as much as the industry standard. The culture is pretty toxic. Definitely pits employees against each other to see any success. Pretty good supervisors laid back place to work I was a Pipefitter first official job got me off my feet an helped me create a life for myself if you are thinking about getting into the shipyard industry Good place if you want to get your foot in the door with the shipyard industry Have to know someone to know someone to move up so network an work harf 2 1 Worked in a secured TS/SCI environment I enjoyed working for BAE. I had an opportunity to take a job closer to my hometown, but I would definitely tell folks this is a good company to work for. 1 I enjoy working there, but be careful if you are a contractor. I really enjoyed working there as a contractor. The only problem I had was getting the run around when it came time to convert me to a full employee, or let me go. They kept extending my contract until I was working there 18 months (it was supposed to be a 12 month contract). I finally got tired of this and put in my two week notice (after securing another job, of course). All of a sudden they started trying to get me to stay there, and finally hired me full time, at a rate above what the new company was going to pay me. I've heard other contractors talking about being in the same situation, so I'm not unique. I really enjoy working for them, though, and am glad they hired me. Not micro managed, supervisors look out for you. Would rather keep you as a contractor than hire you. Great Place to Work I enjoy working at BAE Systems. I have a great work life balance and the people I work with are supportive and allow me to take on new challenges and help me along the way. I would recommend BAE Systems. Good purpose, toxic culture Overall, working for BAE gave me a sense of purpose. But if you don’t fit in with the hierarchy structure of individuals and just do as they say regardless of the absurdity, you will blacklisted and pushed out by any means necessary. The constant struggles between the company and the Union is noticeable in every aspect of manufacturing. The only good part is the pay. Most of the time a great company to work for, but it depends on the sector The contract for my project was not renew and we struggled to find jobs in other sector. Ad Ling a the project contract is in place the benefits and pay are good. Challenging and fun place to work. Great coworkers I’ve been with the company for 2 1/2 years. From the first day I knew I would love my job. The fact that I was build a vehicle that may save someone’s life. Was enough for me to wake up proud and motivated to work! I miss working at BAE. It was like a family! good coworkers worst place to work. no structure and management is terrible and not trained to handle work force issues. good people being mistreated and taken advantage of. management stinks. 4 day work week no structure no reliable management. miss use of government funds and inventory If you love overtime and don’t want to be home with the family this is the place for you. 4 year with the company and haven’t see one Improvement to any of the facilities and management. The company will do whatever they want to hit their numbers Money No life, Poor management. Toxic environment Not a pleasant place to work. High turnover of personnel. No management support or training. Lot of verbal abuse and demeaning management practices. Muy buen lugar para trabajar solo que el salario para los trabajadores de la compañía es muy por debajo Buen ambiente de trabajo mucha seguridad y condiciones para trabajar solo que pagan muy poco en comparación con otras compañías Tienen todos dos beneficios Pocas vacaciones Great place to work Good management, co-workers. 9-80 pay weeks, every other Friday off. Cafeteria on site, gym, good holidays, easy PTO needs. They think of you as a family BAE is a good company to work for BAE is a good company but so are many others. The real difference is the contract as it determines a lot of the administrative stuff. The determination on whether you enjoy a place has to do with the culture. I had a good network and was happy. People are loyal to and quit leaders more than the company itself. Ask the questions that are important to you but don't judge a whole company based on one position. Team High tempo No 80 hour weeks no pay and no life out side of work. short staffed and rude employees. ECO trips from management and other leaders. Toxic work place help. Great company! Gymnasium for the employees, cafeteria, layback, environment. Good company to work for especially if your are looking to get good experience working along side professional in the electronics fields as well in the computer programming field. They did an ok job on communication due to the loss of the contract. The pay could of been higher considering the shift work schedule we did. Also working holidays and getting just regular pay on overtime. But the pay was decent compared to other come. Over all the people are easy to get along with. Lots of busy time but lots of down time also. Management is out of touch. The pay system is in need of an overhaul and the equipment should have been taken out of service in the 90s. Time off Low pay Adequate compensation however woman are not generally promoted Very poor management. People are not recognized for their personal sacrifices to enhance company contributions. Company frequently eliminates senior employees to replace with less costly or experienced. Good but expensive insurance for salaried employees Excessive work load and expectations Great I just wanna read the reviews of a former company. BUT my manager rocks and it really is. Awesome environment. Gleeful staff and good training. I'm having a wonderful time. My skills are growing everyday Long shifts but can be managemeable. Money is really good if you want to work 60+ hours a week Disgusting dusty cesspool of angry union employees that cant stay out of other peoples faces, supervisors will lie to get you in trouble and treat you differently based on race and gender, just pray you are the right one! Management doesn’t care about employees and will do nothing to support them and will instead push them down and demoralize them, nothing good here except the money and maybe you might get along with one or two people maximum Plenty of overtime, sunday is doubletime Everything except the money"
Honeywell|" It Was A Job. I was an Electricians Assistant. I can Run wire, Install Outlets and Switches and Security Cameras. I installed Back-up Cameras, Remote Starters and Detailed Automobiles. No work life balance, squeeze until no juice left Toxic management, no respect for employees, typical company with lots of politics and no care for its workforce. Leaders are brutal and disrespectful to subordinates. Nothing really Exploiting people Office politics; disjointed culture Honeywell has a sterling reputation, and operates profitability in many industries. Operational standards are generally mature, with culture is generally collaborative. Like a lot of big companies, Honeywell has a great deal of bureaucracy that hampers productivity, and tends to drive away top talent. There is a significant amount of office politics at Honeywell— internal alliances, power struggles, finger pointing, and general mendacity. Honeywell has a reputation for treating people as expendable, and has poor retention rates. The various departments tend to be siloed and poorly coordinated. Tough place to be a Director—lots of overlords to please, all giving contradictory instructions, and lots of smiling people who would gladly slit your throat to further their career :( Decent place to work Pretty relaxed environment. Most of the work is fairly straightforward. As long you don't make mistakes you will be fine. Management really depends on what program you are on. If you enjoy being a peon, this is your place. No raises, No bonuses, no acknowledgment, no trust, but they will force you to work LOADS of overtime to cover for the office peoples mistakes. Trades/Skilled laborers are treated like McDonald’s workers. Stay away if you enjoy your sanity and your life. Cause this place drains your soul No good Unsafe training sucks they rush people it’s numbers bigger numbers for bigger checks for management. People don’t get proper training to many accidents. It’s a numbers company None Everything not a safe place 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? The company has a liberal mindset, they force Covid vaccine, inclusion, diversity and you either comply or get fired. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? The core values the liberal mindset possesses. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Very liberal... they force Covid, inclusion and diversity. Definately not a place to work in SETX. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Very stressful. Overall good It was a good experience working at Honeywell. My work was remote due to Covid but I definitely was able to learn a lot while I was there. In addition my team was great. Terrible place Terrible management and laziness. You will work 6 days a week while other departments get sent home with no work. You're also forced to be vaccinated or you can NOT work there. Good place to work with good people. Poor compensation and benefits. Insurance coverage terrible. Expect to dig deep for medical treatment. Compensation lower than industry peers. Stated salary rarely received. 5 of past 8 years company has used unpaid furloughs to save money, resulting in 5-10% pay cuts. ""Unlimited vacation"" policy is great if you can take advantage of it. Managers have to approve all vacations. 8% match on 401K is nice. No profit sharing. Bonuses only available to managers and a few high level engineers. Long hours, great team I worked with Honeywell has changed a lot since I left - before it was sold to Residio. Back then it was an okay place to work. Not great, but it didn't suck the way it does now. Benefits were okay. Pay was decent Team was great Hours were long Great Experience, Bad Benefits Honeywell is a great place to earn some valuable experience. This is a great place to make a career and gain technical knowledge. The insurance is the worst I have ever seen, so if you are willing to sacrifice insurance for your career, this is the place. Coworkers are great people, it is a laid back environment. 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? Dont work there. They moved my job to mexico and wanted us to train them. They are a woke company that is anti american What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Ppl were good. Its the stuffed shirts that suck What is the work environment and culture like at the company? It is terrible What is a typical day like for you at the company? It went to mexico Great place to learn to perform. The best training ground I know. If you can succeed at Honeywell you can succeed anywhere. They taught me how to get things done. High accountability environment. Great group of people. But upper management denied support supply chain to the daily task To understand accountability. Upper management did not supply accurate inventory to complete jobs at hand. Incredible team working six days a week 10 hours a day to only come in the following week and not having enough material to run jobs. The most stressful place on Earth I hated this job the moment I walked in the door. It is extremely difficult to get grounded because there was absolutely no real onboarding process. You're given a computer, cell phone and desk then thrown to the wolves. Each day is increasingly more overwhelming then the one before. Fast pace job Not bad needs more work in those areas but from what I read it’s not a bad job overall just needs to be a little more time off I have no reason to trash the company tho great work environment Fast paced and productive fun work environment The company is overall a very known place. It is hard to miss due to size of building. The management is very well managed and fun environment to be in. The average factory drama. 4/10s, multiple breaks, lunch. Drama, drama, drama A great first job but often lacking movement While working at Honeywell you'll often find that you're doing the same thing every day which is easy. Although the pay & management leave something to be desired Pays ok, insurance is garbage People make more than people who have been with the company for 30 years..Union dont have any real power..The company has a take it or leave it attitude when negotiating the contract... Rf Terrible thecworst place I have worked by far none. Can't bleice how woke they are. It's crazy. They have succumbed to the wackiness of thus world. Naturally. It Was A Job. I was an Electricians Assistant. I can Run wire, Install Outlets and Switches and Security Cameras. I installed Back-up Cameras, Remote Starters and Detailed Automobiles. Great starting pay The pay and time off Is excellent The management team is a joke and will lie on you Following policy and procedure only applies to some people You will feel discrimination and favoritism The union is little to no help and arbitration takes up to 9 months Breaks, pay, time off Management all need to be replaced Very accommodating environment I enjoyed spending time with everyone I worked with, I was only there for an internship, yet my managers made sure to make me feel appreciated. I would work there full time Good opportunities for hours and pay. I enjoyed my time here, but I personally don’t believe in seniority. They promote people who have been there longer, even though they suck at their job. Get to learn a lot there and they don’t micromanage too much after day shift. Job postings are extremely high for a reason Honeywell is very top heavy to bottom, meaning all decisions made towards productivity are non-transparent until the very last minute. Inexperience managers dragging teams along with them on early career mistakes. Hardly any career goals unless you are favored by management. Hard work does not pay out in this company. Look elsewhere Employee appreciation doughnuts and coffee once a month. no systematic guide per role, fumble your way through your role. Lots of opportunitities, sometimes disorganized Big company with lots of opportunities. Sometimes too much going on and people involved so it would be disorganized. Unusual internship due to Covid circumstances so completely remote which may be unfair to judge. All about numbers when I was there No regard to yourself as a person. Did not care if you had issues it was all about how much you could do in the time allowed. 55 hours a week was demanded and burnt out lots of people. Honeywell is a great place to work I worked for Honeywell twice -- Honeywell is a great place to work. I worked at H&BC and at Aerospace. I traveled extensively for Honeywell improving their supply base. The programs at Honeywell are often very unstructured, thus the collapse of the SRT program. Honeywell lets their suppliers tell them what to do, and often pays suppliers bonuses for under performance -- there is poor communications between Honeywell's plants, and often with Senior Level Mangement. 4 stars What is the best part of working at the company? I loved doing my job. Some of the areas were a little bit more challenging then others. I worked there 4 different times. This was due to layoffs. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Some of the people What is the work environment and culture like at the company? There seemed to be some diversity. What is a typical day like for you at the company? I no longer work there. 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? Coworkers What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Management What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Difficult. Not enough people to do the job properly What is a typical day like for you at the company? Stress all day Job seekers beware! Honeywell's moto is to do more with less! Most employees are overloaded with work and expected to get everything done with little help and with the challenge of time being consumed by too many meetings and having to work with employees from their offshore offices which just don't have the same work quality as those located in N.A. offices and adds to the difficulty of executing tasks. In my experience, I had to work 10-14hr days to keep my head above water even though I was an hourly employee (and only get paid for 8hrs), because its an unspoken rule/expectation of all of their employees in any position. Yes, getting paid time off is easy, but comes at a price, because you usually come back to a huge load of stress eats into one's life at home to the point where you're afraid to take time off. Challenging work, paid leave. Tough work loads with long hours expected (but not paid), stressful environment 4 stars What is the best part of working at the company? There is a lot of support and training available. It is a fortune 100 company. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Just deadlines, but you get that working for any company. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Professional, people are easy to work with from any technology. I loved working for the gas technology center. What is a typical day like for you at the company? In the summer you get special hours. You work four ten hour days followed by a half day on Fridays. Good pay Work/life balance sucks. Usually unlimited overtime. Poor management. No real incentives for good performance or production. Only care about the number of pounds going out. Great for a single person with no other obligations. Fun Fun place for people to interact and learn valuable skills to get your own money and learn welding and get a new one and get it back to you and trey can see how 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Belt conveyor and sorter technician What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Not to much What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Very disciplined and helpful to success What is a typical day like for you at the company? Labor Day benefits were excellent from day one. pros. benefits like short term disability were available day 1. 401k match 8% plenty of sick leave annual leave cons. They do not seem to encourage personal growth Fairly regular changes in management staff. Depending on which division you are in there can be layoffs with little warning. Employees are commodities No work/life balance. Comply with leadership and what you’re told our you will be replaced. Senior leadership says people are the differentiator, but it is only lip service. Used to be gold - now is a dud Poor Senior leadership Lack of direction and business skills has completely eroded the culture that one made this company great Have remove any and all ability to execute at the field level Very productive workplace Great place to work, people very trained, helpful and kind. always try to make you exceed their expectations in a good way. They take pride in what they do as a aerospace company Open door culture, lots of red tape Competitive Very demanding Slow, very process oriented 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? The great care and cocern for their enployees. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? The pressure to get out daily quota of product What is the work environment and culture like at the company? better than average,good faith in the management,which I feel does exactly right for the employees.com What is a typical day like for you at the company? Fast Paced sometimes hectic,somes times easy sailing especially toward end of the day It Was A Job. I was an Electricians Assistant. I can Run wire, Install Outlets and Switches and Security Cameras. I installed Back-up Cameras, Remote Starters and Detailed Automobiles. Horrible micromanaged I worked there only 6 months it was just bought by Honeywell n it’s horrible and ran horrible the managers are just sucks and take the horrible life at work out on the new people trying their hardest to empress management which is sick A very average company with average compensation and benefits I've been working for Honeywell in the aerospace sector for a few years, and I can say that it's a very average company, despite how much they say otherwise. The benefits are okay, compensation is a bit lower than their competition and they have a very old-school way of managing the company and how they treat their employees. There is tons of bureaucracy everywhere, and the work life balance is not really that good. We are currently doing a mandatory flex schedule and are being constantly monitored to make sure you are going on-site even though a lot of people can work 100% remotely. Higher management says they keep improving everything for employees, but from the results I've seen they've done the bare minimum to improve the company, and has become very noticeable now that the competition is becoming more modern in the way they handle things. There is a ""hustle"" culture ingrained into the company, and is very obvious just by their company behaviors. The company advertises unlimited vacation time, but what you actually get is 15 days vacation and the rest need to be approved by your manager, which is very rarely the case that it is approved. You do get to work with a lot of very smart people and a lot of interesting products. Although, a lot of the tech is ancient by today's standards, but still very cool and very impressive solutions. I do recommend the company despite all of the negatives just because of the feeling of community that employees have with each other. That is one of the reasons it has made it hard for me to leave. Interesting projects to work on and tons of things to learn from them and coworkers, employee parties and activities (outside of work hours), company paid business travel, good career development opportunities, work with smart, talented and great people. Mid/Higher management is very out of touch with the employees, work-life balance is rare, too much bureaucracy, hustle culture, very average compared to other aerospace companies Exciting and interesting projects There are many exciting projects to work on in various fields. The work is fun and fulfilling as an engineer. There are a wide variety of positions in just about all engineering disciplines. Exciting work New design work often has agressive schedules and small budgets 2 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Interesting work What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Downsizing of US employees and shifting work overseas Great Great place to work could pay better and use less drama there is too much he said she said around the company and people don’t come to you about issues they go to everyone else and assume but other than that it’s great and great opportunities with decent pay Coworkers are fun to work with but managers or managment is horrible and useless Honeywell Lincolnshire is very poor in management, managers or supervisors they get the position without even have the experience as management role and about flow or work process are negatively clueless. Company completely disorganized The upper management is a revolving door which allows for no continuity in the lower levels. Spend more time on meeting and computer work rather than actually doing your job. 4 stars What is the best part of working at the company? The experience What is the most stressful part about working at the company? The procedures What is the work environment and culture like at the company? We were the independent contractor at the site responsibility was the conveyor system they thought we were responsible for the entire plant building maintenance plumbing to construction we were not. What is a typical day like for you at the company? System could be down or not do preventative maintenance on systems check for faults or alarms during the last shift to determine steps to take in fixing the issue if all is fine just maintain conveyor system during shift fun place to work honeywell has been a wonderful company starting out. Several things worth pointing out are within the overall atmosphere. Since honeywell is a very loarge company, it allows the management team to easily help everyone get acquainted with the overall job feel. My fellow team members have been wonderful helping me get setup in my developer area. Honeywell does fun and interesting things such as having a large celebration once a month for all employees with birthdays that month. The hiring process was wonderful and easily streamlined. All expectations were made clear throughout the entire process. I look forward to making a full career at Honeywell by achieving the expectations placed in front of me. Steady work place friendly environment team work Even though I had to travel 7hrs for the job it was a life changing and experimental opportunity to learn and meet new people and once I got there it was what I expected and ill definitely look forward to doin the same and being a team player anywhere and any other opportunity or company has to offer Productive, fast pace move up and overtimevwork Good and productive work place.good training easily explained work rask outgoing jobs completed ability to move up on the job.absolutly no hor playing.Seriously about safety and safety rules tolerant and strick about your work schedule and job performance Overtime Short breaks 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? I'm working with a great team,and the environment is very good, and also honeywell shows me a lot of things that I don't know,from p.p.e.all the way to aerospace.. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? I never found any stressful while I start working with this company until now What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Very good people, respectful and comunication,communication, apply.. What is a typical day like for you at the company? On my first month 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Opportunity for improving the process. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? #1 Denial by mid- management of the need for utilizing technology to maintain manufacturing advantages over competitors. Too much living in the past, before MRP. #2 Resistance to documented BOM’s to drive material planning/ control and reduction of inventory. standard made textile goods (with only 2 main options; material and sizing). Old school refusing new school technology to allow business clarity. Ie. early Windows 90’s tech versus 2010’s MRP technology that was never utilized to it’s full capability due to resistance…..would rather preach the products are too complex to build Bills of materials, where in reality 90% + of goods are standard, it tends to be the 10% of Marketing rebranding / waging the dog and confusing manufacturing goals. The Dayton site has made changes within the last year to help move the technology forward and tear down some of the walls of resistance. Not unlike many companies, Change is scary, but not changing tends to give the competition a easy advantage and so they gain by understanding the market and utilizing technology. I think the future will see this team drive the company forward, at the Dayton site. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Air conditioning, great lighting and the people try to do the right things. What is a typical day like for you at the company? General fire fighting as in any job worth doing. Good salary, turbulent environment Company pays well. I like cooperation with people i know a lot of professionals. The constant changes make it tought. Also work-life balance is not as i would expected Awesome but conniving I got nerve damage on a heavy machine there in my writing hand, due to an employee that had many felonies and wasn’t supposed to work there. They tricked me into thinking I’d keep my job for 6 whole months and then fired me. All I wanted was to work there, All they wanted was a body to break down and add to a list. I loved the company so much it was a challenging new environment and taught me a lot. They DO NOT care about you as an individual though lol. Don’t work here. Trabajo fácil pero aburrido y requiere atención a ciertos detalles El trabajo es recomendable para el que le guste trabajar en fábricas. Casi todos los trabajos son fáciles pero son aburridos y tienes que estar pendiente a los detalles. Paga razonable Mala administración y se tardan demasiado en contratar Productive and fun work place Good Management, Good Benefits, Large Organization with flexible job roles. Good Work culture, Good Job security, Good Travel policies and added benefits. Large Organization with flexible job roles. Autonomy, but micromanaged through the CRM, pay structure dependent on performance of others You are a number at Honeywell, like other conglomerates. They are slow moving because of their size. CRM will determine your success at the company in certain roles, everything must be recorded to the nth degree. The pay structure in my role had a lot of potential for good money, unfortunately it was tied to the performance of another role. Honeywell is an ok place to work, if you like a very corporate structure, lots of meetings, KPIs and data points but no personality, you will probably like it here. Coworkers make it worth it We did a lot of 12 hours days and we were expected to do overtime. Money was good. My supervisors were good and I loved my spot on 2nd shift. Work/life balance is not good. Amazing starting point Great Company Miss Culture is great. PTO is unlimited depending on your role. Work is consistent, with you level of training, Great starting point for new engineer and a great company to have on your resume doubt you will ever need to look again. It Was A Job. I was an Electricians Assistant. I can Run wire, Install Outlets and Switches and Security Cameras. I installed Back-up Cameras, Remote Starters and Detailed Automobiles. Multitasking skills are a must and paying attention to detail. I enjoyed working there and the people I worked with. Not everyone is as friendly as the dept I was in . The downside was : Not giving people enough training before those with yrs of experience leave . There were people not willing to share their experiences with other. You have to stand up for yourself and stand your ground. 2 weeks vacation, Pto, makeup time lost. For 8 hrs you get one 10 min breaks and one 20 min lunch. Run away!! This company (intelligrated) was incredible until Honeywell took over. So many changes and downfalls took place. The management changed and all of a sudden their production was the absolute only thing they cared about. PERIOD. Not how long someone has worked there, or the quality of their work. nothing too many things to count 1 1 Great people to work with, but not enough resources/people There are plenty of opportunities for growth, advancement, learning, etc. Only issue with this is the company refuses to hire enough staff to allow people to have the time to work on these things. The days are taken up with the monotonous standard work/paperwork and items that must be done on a daily basis. There is barely enough time to focus on your production line. This is all alleviated if you are ok with working longer hours outside of your standard 40-hour work week. Management team needs some work. Seems like every 4-6 months the whole leadership team changes which is never good. culture of fear seemed like a great place to work. Being a national security manufacturing facility, I understand the need for security, but they insist on self-reporting even the most minor issues and actively solicit coworkers to report other's behavior, resulting in everyone looking over their shoulder. Accusations are only minimally reviewed. Do NOT recommend working there. Increasing smartness of work I used my skilled to make a parts good. Management response me all time so I increased my skilled. I was fully satisfy with my work. Increase my knowledge by using different instruments. Follow 5S. Keep my work area clean. Environmental Good place to work, great experience and good place to start, good culture. Very friendly and everyone is there for toy to help, I enjoy working at this company Not a friendly atmosphere / inconsistent with training The place is very cold in terms of employees not being happy. Four Senior Buyers quit all at the same time. A new manager who is trying to make a name for himself was not understanding with the work load or that we were understaffed by four people. One Buyer in particular has chased off three people within a year. Benefits are horrible. I would only apply if you are desperate for a job. Decent place if you want to work 6 days a week Presses are very old and tough to complete certain jobs. Will be expected to work mandatory overtime at a moments notice. Do not recommend if you want any life outside of work. meh - keep searching Work Culture is work. They flood you with KPI's and you wonder which one is most important - answer all of them. Compensation is good to start but then 2% raises. If the stock tanks expect layoffs or furloughs - hey why not give back a week of your pay so they can buy back more stock? they treated people horribly during the pandemic - hiring people out of college then letting them go after only 1 week and they had all relocated. Anything to make the stock bounce back and hide the issues the CEO has caused. Hard pass It Depends on what division and your manager I know people who love their job, and I know people who hate it. It really depends on the division and your manager. I enjoyed most of my time there but I finally felt pushed out by a new manager. Too many silos to be successful The revolving door of leadership is a problem, but not as much of an issue as the internal silos and competing priorities between business units. Business unit A is incented to go left, while business unit B is incented to go right. The diverging path strategy just doesn't work. Other than that, it's the typical too much work, not enough people, resulting in the absence of strategic decisions and the refusal to admit that the competition is moving forward while Honeywell is standing still trying to figure out how to invest as little as possible into the business while maximizing shareholder value. Unpaid overtime, micromanagement. Horrible Management that does not value hard work or workers. Agressive deadlines and overtime not allowed. Test Micro""Manager"" who never stood up for his employees and would make them work unpaid overtime with agressive deadlines. Fast-paced fun Pay is worth is for how much work you put in. I was making face maskes there for a while and I loved the repetition of it. Time flew by and I met some great people. Review -coluld be better could be worse Overall solid company but bey driven by policies and procedure and you are forced into the mold even if the mold is not a fit for the job. Job was ok but company tried to claw back as much as possible from employees Mid level mgmt good Excessive expected hours Challenging place to work but nice pay out and growth. Good company, nice pay. Unrealistic expectations from management. Eliminated remote work without any viable reasons. Unlimited vacations and flexible options. Supervisors and some co workers They expect to much from a trainee and are rude when you ask a question about what you are putting together. Some co-workers like to talk about you to others behind your back at least in Boyne City Michigan Not bad Good place to work, do t like to hire in temps tho. Will lay off when they don’t need you. Pay is okay. Per diem was fair but should be higher for skilled Decent pay and work The work is simple physically but will test you knowledge wise. The employees are good people. Management could use some work on human relations side. Pay and benefits Management Honeywell There’s no life balance here. You will work over 16 hours a day to make ends meet and no overtime will ever be approved. Culture is super rude and it’s tolerated by Honeywell leadership. Don’t work here if you want to have a life outside of work. It’s so much work and overwhelming that health will deteriorate here. Pay isn’t as good with such high demands Good Company Company facing similiar challenges in the current environment in finding good people with the right skills. Not enough skilled people and challening customers. Big Company Big Company It Was A Job. I was an Electricians Assistant. I can Run wire, Install Outlets and Switches and Security Cameras. I installed Back-up Cameras, Remote Starters and Detailed Automobiles. Unnecessary stress. The job has good potential. However, there is a lot of unnecessary stress put on the workers there and they really try to show impartiality but in the end it is very obvious that they are not impartial. Some freebies and good people. Machines break often and stuff happens a lot. 2 The job suffers from poor leadership The management talks trash about their own workers and about the others in upper management, they need to rethink their business model it’s predicated on lying to other companies and their workers in order to increase their profit margins… None Over worked and under appreciated 3 Decent Place if you are Single with no Life. I will say that I did like working here even with my body not agreeing with the job. However, I barley got to see my friends and loved ones and the work was rough. The one thing that stood out was there was not much help when it came to COVID. Even if there was someone on the floor with it and THE MANAGERS KNEW we would not only be asked to work but there was still not enough space between everyone for social distancing. Short Breaks with Long Hours and not much care for workers health. mgt has no idea how to run a company. if they were not protected by bottomless pockets of govt contracts, they would have been closed long ago everything is void of common sense there. They will bring in every single person over a triple pay holiday, JUST SO they can report to their site leader that ""they tried"" to make the production goals (that were never going to happen for one reason or another) but if they had not aligned all the soldiers on the front line, then site management would tell them they did not do everything possible to meet the quota. They expect 2.5 million dollars of revenue each day using broken and outdated (or MISSING) equipment. Zero support from all levels of Production. Its really just a paycheck. If you sign up to work there for any other reason, you are fooling yourself. And dont be surprised if they dont keep their word. They will award you a position and then refuse to give you the training, even after they took money from your check for the new position. HR is non-existent at best. Hate working there, trying to leave asap occasional free food, if thats your thing, overtime, if thats your thing, its airconditioned in most of the building absolutely ZERO leadership, a rotating door of people at all levels makes it difficult to find a stable routine Great place Great place to work. Management is great. Pay is great. Tons of work, you’ll never be bored! Getting laid off sucks. Management seems to care about your well being. Not a Great Experience Honeywell is simply not a great place to work. They have a beautiful new building in uptown Charlotte with great technology and free snacks, but it masks the true nature of the business. Layoffs and furloughs are very common. You are pressed to get things done very quickly, but the processes they have established make that impossible so there is constant pressure. They want you in office (3 days per week now but this may change) even if you will site on Teams' calls all day with people in other states and countries. Attrition is very high which speaks volumes. Salary is good but benefits are subpar - health insurance is very expensive, 401k match is only deposited once per year and requires a 3 year vesting period. Unlimited PTO is really a joke... it is really just a way to ensure that the business does not have to pay out time if you resign or if they lay you off. Nice uptown building; good technology Healthcare benefits very expensive; limited bonus potential; job security (layoffs, furloughs); death by process Was great place to work Was a great place to work at. Lots of overtime to work. They paid pretty good as well. Room to advance if you put in good work and show you want it.. Not good company for average worker. Don't expect amazing things here, poor professionalism from the management and subordinates. RH don't exist there, it felt the tension even the first day of work. Great place to work I am a retired Lpn and the screening job was perfect fit. I live 2 miles from facility and it was the perfect part time job for me. I miss working with such a great group of people. Great helpful coworkers None Very unorganized and unprofessional place to work. I would not suggest working at Honeywell they don't give you any training an expect you to do the job. If you do get any training it dose not help. The management was not helpful their to busy gossiping and the workers cover for them. I've never seen such an unorganized and unprofessional place to work very stressful. Great company when fully staffed Great people and good pay but every dept is now understaffed and is bringing down plant morale. Lots of weekends and OT. But when fully staffed the plant runs very well. Fantastic place to work and well established Working at HW was a great experience and opened my life to o many more exciting benefits and travel experiences. Great 401k and retirement benefits. Just to name a few. I'm Looking forward to new opportunities. Old Honeywell culture replaced with Allied Signal culture after 2007 Too much focus on schedule and budget at expense of quality and safety. Program managers are floggers instead of problem solvers and too removed from the technical issues. Their schedules for deliverables are arbitrary instead of reflecting process dependencies. flexible hours and personal time for engineers overload of tasks and not enough engineers Productive and fun work You will get exposure to all international clients. Good learning opportunity. Colleague are very supportive. Job security is very good. At the time you have to accept less increment Productive and fun workplace Great place to work with decent pay. Management is fair with an open door policy if or whenever you have issues or concerns. Your typical work day is approximately 8 hours. Room for advancement Lay-offs Good place overall! Overall a good place to work. Good pay and usually overtime. Friendly co-workers for the most part, that are willing to train you and be patient. Relatively relaxed environment. With a high focus on quality. Good place to work. It was a great experience. Honeywell have a lot of activities, where we can get together as coworkers and enjoy ourselves, like softball and basketball tournaments. Decent Job The pay isn't great; it's OK. The benefits are good. The job security and the work/life balance are fantastic. Everyone is very respectful and professional; good social culture. The work is never stressful. Working in classified setting sucks especially as a software developer. There are rules and regulations on everything (understandably so). 401k and benefits Very good opportunity to move up in the company if you have good leadership. Be sure to take advantage of 401k and company matching and also educational reimbursement and training. alright place to make your money while you focus on other endeavors The job is a good job its just the work place politics and management that makes it not a fun environment, tons of high school drama, employees get bullied and punished a lot."
i3 Verticals|" great place to work. good culture, excellent work life balance, caring management. I enjoyed my time at i3 Verticals and would encourage anyone with the opportunity to work there if possible. 1 Avoid Management is condescending and completely out of touch. Weekends are mandatory. They become more mandatory as more people get fired for a simple mistake, or quit from the burnout. Despite this, you'll still get complaints from management about working overtime just to keep your head above water, workload-wise. Make sure you don't have any funerals scheduled, and you'll be fine.

Great management No full-time opportunity Growth This company is growing by leaps and bounds. Career path is endless. Hard work and dedication is what you need to advance, You can identify the change you are making and management values your ideas and you as a person. The culture is fun and the people are some of my best friends. Love this company! Career Growth, Culture none Seems like a great job at first When you first start this job it seems like a promising job, but I would not recommend this job unless you have YEARS of experience working in this specific industry. If you have not done this before it will be pretty impossible to keep this job. You are not given time to learn your role and if you don't learn fast enough, they will get rid of you. The pay is okay and it is nice leaving at 5pm everyday, but it is an extremely stressful job with very high expectations that are hard to meet. The health insurance also isn't that great and you do not get sick days. Pay and work schedule High expectations, no sick days, no time to learn, stressful environment Horrible stay away!!!!! I have been with this company for a while and witnessed employees come and go. They don't properly train and they under value full timers but mostly part timers. Each are very valuable to the companies success part timers spend their entire weekends there and only get one day off and full timers all week. I have watched many come and go especially new hires they are thrown into the fire without proper preparation. I3 expects them to give their whole life to them but treats them all poorly and like they are below the totem pole. The management don't have a care in the world very immature and all over the place. They voice to everyone to come to them for our concerns but are quick on the offense and take it personally. I regret my years spent here and I am currently in line for a new position elsewhere. If you want true professionalism and belonging don't come here the most stressful job I have ever had! Coworkers, clean work enviroment Not enough training, undervalued, horrible management, and drama No Good Training! But they want Stellar work performed! They call it training, but really you watch someone do the work on a computer and in that same day they put you to work. They give you a study guide to refer to and say ask questions if you need help, but when u ask a question they say look in the guide. They expect you to learn literally within days of being shown something then teach you to do something else. They all talk about you behind your back! They overload you with work that you are not fully trained on! A great place to work Opportunities for advancement and flexible scheduling, along with employee led events make this a very fun and engaging place to work. Job security is high and turnover is low.

There is a lot of information to take in so it might not be for everyone. Very detailed oriented. Fun Place to Work The culture of the company is great. My suggestion to Management pay your employees what they are worth. Stop treating us like cheap labor without regards to allowing us to make a living to take care of our families like you are able to. In this industry there is a lot to learn on a daily basis, because it is forever changing. Some of us participate in multiple roles, because the company does not want to employ needed workforce. Instead you work multiple positions and do not receive proper compensation for the first role you are hired for. Quit being cheap so you can hold on to smart hard-workiong employees you do have; before you end up wit no employees at all. Free lunches, co=Workers, Overall Environment Pay is less than acceptable Great Atmosphere Great job to have. Ive learned patiences with dealing with customers via phone conversations. Nice ping pong table to relieved stress during a work week. Wonderful people to work with, and great team.

North Star Imaging| Good Place to work fun and caring people I guess this is where I started my career in automation.

Very stressful all of the time and they have employees come and go often. The people there were very friendly. Good place to work I loved working here. People have left since I worked at this company but overall a very good company to work for. I respect them very much.

LOCKHEED MARTIN CORPORATION|" Excellent place to work/ Good work life balance Excellent place to work. They have a thing called 9/80 flex which allows you to work your 80 hours over 9 days and get every other Friday off. They are also very accommodating to your schedule and let you count eating lunch at your desk as working time. great place to work. 28 21 Good place to work It’s manufacturing and as such of good leadership it’s pretty good, but bad leadership makes it a bad place. I had a bad director, but saw good ones in other departments. Great pay and environment to retire I liked working here with the people. My manager helped and gave me chances that were of personal considerations and not just text book jargon when it came to some problems I had at the time. If you are a good stand up individual you can be sure to have a decent day no matter what. I found I was under utilized due to lack of product movement so the day was slow going but who complains about down time I suppose. People and pay None Ethical work force - people work hard and are reliable I worked for LM for 15 yrs but it’s hard work. Lots of regulations and policies. People perform well and managers can be tough. Especially in the program management chain. Life in your Hands, Pay is less then McDonald's Working here is a great feeling, you do your job right and you know you're helping and possibly saving lives. Being a defense contractor for the US government along with builds for private companies most of which a very technical and precise. If you do something wrong you could cause catastrophic chaos and death, and being that you built it, it can come back to you 15 years later, and you could be blamed. The pay does not equal that's stress level and what's expected. You can get a job bagging groceries or stocking shelves for nearly or the same pay rate. It's a fantastic company that does a lot of good, that needs to think more about the people that support it. Interesting work. Out of date culture. A typical day consists of putting out random fires all over the place. I learned many things about aircraft systems. Management was all over the place with misaligned directions day to day. Culture is out of date and aging. Hardstand part of the job was staying on one task long enough to complete it. The most enjoyable part of the job was the technology. Technology, advanbment. Culture and management. It’s great I have worked at Lockheed for quite some time now… it is full of opportunities if you look for them. It has a ton of benefits and perks. It’s very inclusive and everyone is generally eager to help, responsive, and respectful. Good Pay They have gone politcally correct like all big corporations. Good pay and benefits chance to relocate to other areas if desired. Your just a number. You can Advance if you have the ambition and don't mind sucking up. Pay Your just a number Insightful Typical day (4x10): come in 5a-7:30am, 10-hr mixed-bag of processing defect disposition, designing tools, installing/testing new production equipment, studying producibility w/ design engineering, and updating visual/written/content of manufacturing process plans. Paid OT is practically guaranteed, which seems unusual. Task switching is frequent, ~15mins - 1hr. Learned: time/task management; taking notes/checklists; Lockheed Martin sites significantly vary in standards; you are what you negotiate, not what you are worth; some deemed ""critical"" production facilities seem outdated by almost decades and over capacity; holding your own against colleagues who only care about their own interests. Workplace Culture: People are easily approachable and willing to help; it is arguably agile despite low awareness of the term. Systemic issues are often deferred because of the financial investment (despite the RoI) or schedule. Also, promotions are scare and/or random; interviewing for your promotion or leaving is the new norm. This hurts business continuity and overhead. Quality of floor operators also often mismatches with support staff expectations. Some leaders acknowledge this. However, these issues may come with the territory that this facility has strategically positioned itself in. 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Having the chance to use and sharpen my customer service and technical skills. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? It never was stressful What is the work environment and culture like at the company? An open and inviting learning environment What is a typical day like for you at the company? IT help desk support work and Audio visual operations and diagnostics Good job overall, not for me. The job is good. The training is ok, the people I work with are great. The employee moral is not the best. Not to mention it feels so isolated when you go into work. Great People, Flexibility Moral, pay. Poor management from top to bottom The work culture at this site is abhorrent at best. Most of the workers are lazy and poorly trained with a set agenda of not taking any responsibility when errors occur. Its a hostile company to work for at every corner. The management is hired entirely through the means of nepotism, not focused hiring the proper candidate for the job. The pay is quite alright, but they will never increase it aside from the yearly hourly increase you would normally obtain through means of inflation (1 USD/year). I do not recommend working for this company unless you are one of the aforementioned lazy/unskilled types trying to work for a company that will leave you in the dust if you don't be quiet and follow their leaders into the abyss. Overall 3/10 experience is my almost 5 years with this company. 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Great compensation package and flexibility What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Our mission is so critical , you want to excell What is the work environment and culture like at the company? # 1. Ask Forbes Magazine Great place to work....pay for licensed tradesmen is way low Great place to work..I work four tens ( 4 days a week with Fridays off..my commute is short free Gym for employees ( it's the size of a golds gym with loads of free weights, cardio room, bicycle room, rock climbing wall, full showers and locker room. Upper management doesn't communicate with workers. HR department is oblivious to rate for a licensed tradesman Free gym, trails on campus Food at cafeterias are priced like an airport( over priced stale food ). . Average Workplace The job itself is very interesting and rewarding but leadership needs improvement. Leadership works out of state and is not fully aware of issues in the workplace. Great work-life balance LM allows me to challenge myself inside and outside of the role. This particular jobs lets me apply my master's degree while also having ample room to do paid overtime if I would like. Pretty boring A bunch of old timers and are just punching the clock and hate their life. They don’t do anything for their union workers and the work is super depressing Massive potential for advancement, location, and future growth This company is like a small country. If you are accepted it offers a very secure future, good pay, and if you can leverage the GI Bill for more education, you can either advance further up or even move laterally within the company and multiple in locations. LM corporate culture is c9bvoluted, woke and full of PC liberals I was hired by LM for a secure (TS/SCI) cleared position to do the job of a lazy U.S. Army CWO5 because the Army could not do the job. After 8 years of excellent job performance reviews the Army finally found a CWO who would do his job and told me I was no longer needed. They couldnt fire me so they said they had to cut my pay by 40%, i could stay and work for half of what i had worked my way up to over 8 years or leave. ...I left and went back to college. LM couldnt care less about their employees. Good pay Terrible leadership and corporate culture. Great People and Work/Life Balance If you want a job with little pressure and great schedule flexibility, I recommend. They do have some issues adopting new technology and changing old broken processes. Management is helpful, but seem to have no impact on pay, raises, or big needed changes. It is a very relaxed environment. Health insurance could be better. Good company Excellent place to work, good work life balance, national security work, electrical engineering nice work, computer science nice project, mechanical work. Excellent place to work/ Good work life balance Excellent place to work. They have a thing called 9/80 flex which allows you to work your 80 hours over 9 days and get every other Friday off. They are also very accommodating to your schedule and let you count eating lunch at your desk as working time. great place to work. 28 21 Managers are a dime a dozen and have no added benefit other than for themself Managers are a dime a dozen and have no added benefit other than for themself. No advancement on technical skills or performance only by who you know. Jobs are posted, you can apply, but they are intended for the managers ""pet"" and your application will not even be reviewed until it is given to someone else. Good steady job, friendly working environment. The job overall is good. You are free to work alone especially working on swing shift. You get to learn a lot of cool things at the beginning. The job can get very monotonous at times. This is an easy job overall and a great stepping stone job that looks good on a resume. 1 Decent As with most companies, opportunity and success are tied to specific managers. There are good and there are bad.... and they don't do a great job at weeding out the bad. Work life balance is respected everywhere, however, and that is a major benefit. Security of knowing that work will always come is a major benefit as well. Wages and benefits could be more competitive. Great place to work if you don't mind a move or two Great place to work. To have a truly successful career and move up you may need to move locations several times which can be hard to do with a family. Stellar company to work for I have been employed there almost 20 years and it is fantastic place to work. The pay is dynamite and the work is fun and challenging. You just can't do any better around this area work from home easy schedule, nice people, disconnected management. Easy commute, can work at home most of the time if you want. Everything constantly in flux and there are too many managers Eh Been here 5 years since I left undergrad. They paid for my master's degree. Promotions are few and far between. Constant turnover of younger workers because they don't get recognition. Most management is meh. Some good, some bad. The higher you look in the company the more you just see that it's about the individual and not the team. Also, it's great to not see your manager for 2 years while you work in the office and they get to work from home. /s 4 day work week Management good place very nice place to work in they give you a hybrid from home work style which is very nice and keep work life balance steady overall nice place to work in hybrid schedule not many A place where you can grow Lockheed is a place where you can explore other areas as an engineer and find what you enjoy which i really appreciate. The culture is decent and I have no complaints. Good experience Remote internship but everyone was very caring and were willing to help. Lots of intern-wide events which I enjoyed and we got to meet with people within our department and the whole company. Everyone is willing to help out. The company has very strong work-life balance benefits with hybrid work schedule and a high amount of PTO relative to competitors but ability for advancement can be hampered. Great benefits & flexibility, Ok pay Lockheed is a great company to grow while working in a fast paced environment. Management is very flexible & helpful. They offer clear promotional ladders within various departments. Pay is not GREAT compared to other defense contractors in the area, but annual performance based reviews open the doors for continual increases. Likes working with customers, tolerates management Overall not a bad company to work. Don't pay the best vs rival companies. Always changing rules and policies. Had 3 or more different time card systems. Had the same job and moved 3 or more divisions of LM. TDY pays actuals so you don't make money while away from home. Rumor on the street they charge the customer 2X what they pay you so they can pay management. Management takes a workers position, but sits in the high castle and doesn't help the workers. You can get promoted if you go to a location that no one wants to go to. All depends on location Lockheeh is a massive company. My experiance with this company will be vastly different than other based on loaction and job. At the location I was in, the job and benifiets were great. But that is where corprate Lockheed serperates from individual work sites and jobs. My management changed 3 times in the 4 years I worked there. Being a field technican, this made life extremely difficult due to each managment wanting to re-invent the wheel to try to impress their bosses so they can move on (hence we had such high turnaround on mangement. Pay was about $10-15 less at this location than it was for the same job, but at a site 10 miles away. Overall, Lockheed is an amazing company with some fantastic people that leads the world on innovation. Just be aware, like any company, you can have bad managment that leads you to leave for other oppertunities. Great Benefits , Very Flexible Schedule They offer a very generous 401K match and a very flexible 4/10 work schedule. Managers are always willing to help you get to the next level of your career. Good work environment Working for Lockheed was a great. It gave me the opportunity to give my family a great life an if I wanted to take advantage, grow within the company. Beware of Ocala Ocala operations is not a good place to work. They run skeleton crews and overwork employee’s. They have a massive problem with keeping employees from the work culture and managements focus on there own promotions. Horrible management There is absolutely no work/life balance. This company treats their employees very bad and expect them to smile about it. It doesn't matter your qualifications, the good ol boy system rules, nepotism runs this business! Cool jet Work life balance Total ignorance and lack of care from management. People get rewarded for big mistakes. Very misguided leadership with zero training program. Management in my building had zero NDT background and allowed the building to run ragged for over 30 years with corners being cut in safety and processes. Literally had to teach myself everything with zero training. A radiographer of over 30 years passed away and not one person from management or leadership attended his memorial service. Management clearly doesn't care about their people. Just want you to hit their quota for inspecting rocket motors so that they get their bonuses at the end of the year. Worst leadership I have ever seen. Good schedule with pretty good pay. Ignorant management. Horrible culture. Sub par benefits. Great place to Build exposure to your field Large workplace environment to build skills for your arsenal. Great place to work for work/life balance. Chances for advancement if you put yourself out there. You will see complacency in people or you will see people with a passion to succeed Work life balance Bad yearly performance raises Excellent place to work/ Good work life balance Excellent place to work. They have a thing called 9/80 flex which allows you to work your 80 hours over 9 days and get every other Friday off. They are also very accommodating to your schedule and let you count eating lunch at your desk as working time. great place to work. 28 21 Dictatorship Manager discribed his style as a dictatorship I quit a few weeks later.. houly guys were great. Managment mostly ex military hot tempers and poor managment Hourly people were great Managment 2 Average workplace Low amount of work. All the technicians are good and willing to help at the drop of a hat. The pay could be a lot better for full time guys. When contractors are making double the money that is a problem. Cool It was decent to work here. No complaints. Good pay for my area. Nice location with parking. Learned a lot in a short amount of time. However I was thrown into the fire Good money, boring work I got hired to be an Avionics Tech, which turned into installing a few boxes and testing coax on jets in final production. Most nights were spent looking busy since there isn't much work to do. Good pay, you literally can't be fired You literally can't be fire even if you are terrible and a drain on the rest of your crew, boring and management/salary look down on the hourly folks Good managers are great, bad managers are horrible If you manage to draw a good manager, then your time will be valued, your work will be rewarding, and you will feel respected as a professional. If you draw a bad manager, then you will be micromanaged, disrespected, and treated as disposable. Probably the best place I've ever worked at I began working here after getting out of the military and was still young. I didn't realize it at the time, that this job would be the best I ever had until after leaving Lockheed Martin and working for another employer. The work life balance, the company culture, the ability to develop stronger skills in your career field and not stagnate is unprecedented elsewhere. It's an extremely professional organization that I thoroughly enjoyed being a part of. Pay, benefits, work life balance, calm management None Great people, innovative culture, good pay I have had a great time as an intern with LM. I feel lucky to have had the opportunity to work with this company and its employees. I have felt nothing but support from everyone I have encountered here. Solid place to work Decent benefits and great work life balance with 4x10 work week. Poor raises that don't keep with inflation and promotions are slow and will depend on your manager. Productive and business driven work environment The job is the job, great pay, great place to work long as you avoid managers. Ultimately best job you could have, in this rising priced economy nowadays. Would have been grate if people were held accountable I really liked working at this location and had grate repour with just about everyone but had to quit because of one person. One of the GS personnel actually had a stack of CACs from everyone that quit because of them. HR had many complaints on this person but to my understanding they still work there. HR reached out to me about them but since they were well aware of the issues I didn't waste my time. If you are told that people are quitting because of the same person then obviously they are an issue. The blatant disrespect, condescending attitude and overall laziness of this person was seen by everyone in the building. There were arguments between this person and other employees that could be heard through he walls of their office and there was even one clear cut instance of conflict of interest as one of the approving authorities for us was married to them. This was pointed out as well as instances where the spouse was needlessly making us jump through hoops for documents we were required to be provided but they didn't feel like scanning them over. In the end nothing was done. It's unfortunate when a company has good pay and nice benefits but it's ruined by one person they refuse to hold accountable. I would have kept working here but as soon as I got a better offer I left. Good benefits doesn't hold employees accountable even with HR complaints Great Pay and Benefits My only complaint is being on second shift, but it is seniority based with the Union and you have to do your time. Other than that it is a great place to work. Everyone is polite and respectful. Good life/work balance They really strive to create a good life/work balance. Allowing flex time opportunities, helps with balancing the busy work load, as well as family life. Amazing place to work Great benefits, people, pay, incentives!!! Slight disorganization but that’s everywhere, if you are willing to learn you WILL advance in a short amount of time! Management is destroying this company I've been working here for over 10 years. When I started here, things weren't perfect, but manageable. In the past few years, however things have just been getting progressively worse. Before, it seemed like management was indifferent towards their workforce. Today, they are openly hostile towards us. Turnover has gotten much worse. When we do get new hires on the floor, they only stay a few months before finding another job. Now its to the point where many experienced employees are moving on. Management constantly sets us up to fail, then blames us for their failures. It's best to avoid this company unless you are fresh out of school and looking for something to put on your resume. Fulfilling job Every day there are new challenges to face and the work environment is great. Management is a little hard to talk to since they are always in meetings, but they are very flexible for work/life situations. Was a typical aircraft maintenance contractor position people on the hanger floor were great to work with. Job required a lot of travel. When project was cancelled, company did little to find internal positions pay Plenty of opportunities from coast to coast. Work life balance is easy to attain. For an aerospace company the access to top technology is pretty amazing. The overall corporate size has both positives and negatives. Good people management willing to work with employee needs. Excellent work culture for safety and employee needs Employer provides all necessary time and tools for training Good management, willing to work with employee needs Low stress Great place to work Work life balance good Good place to work. Family friendly. I been here for many years and have enjoyed the lifestyle. Many family members are here and the benefits are great Good place to work Really good place to work. Good people and good benefits. The products are diverse and there is definite room for growth and development. Would definitely recommend Excellent place to work/ Good work life balance Excellent place to work. They have a thing called 9/80 flex which allows you to work your 80 hours over 9 days and get every other Friday off. They are also very accommodating to your schedule and let you count eating lunch at your desk as working time. great place to work. 28 21 Loads of OT Lots of OT, definitely worth it if you’re not a single parent. The money is great but sometimes you spend more time out there than you want and it feels like a prison. It's just meh Always issues with production, nobody is ever held accountable for shoddy work. Management is not focused on the right things to improve the production. Lots of OT, decently high pay Terrible health care, zero accountablility A great place to work! You are treated like a necessary asset to the Company. I loved working for Lockheed. Unfortunately due to a Family emergency I had to return home. The only down side to working for Lockheed Palmdale is living in the Antelope Valley, therefore it would be a good idea to live in the best area you can afford. My wife and I rented a home next to a Golf Course and the rent was pretty reasonable by SoCal standards. Lots to do in the area if you are adventurous and willing to explore. Well compensated pay, but at division I worked for (LM Ft.Worth), incompetent management and questionable ethics Lockheed is a large company with over 82 divisions and each one has its own personality and competency. I have been impressed with many of them that I traveled to and worked with over the years. That said, LM Ft. Worth is not one of them. Although well compensated in pay, this division of Lockheed has incompetent management and questionable ethics. If that is not an issue for you, good place to work. If it is an issue for you I do not recommend working at this division of Lockheed Well compensated pay Incompetent management and questionable ethics Lockheed is a great company! Great pay and benefits! Great people. Great management. No complaints. I was very close with my fellow employees, and I sincerely enjoyed going to work each day. A lot of benefits It has a lot of benefits for the employees. There's nice people to work with and a lot of strict people who live for the company. It can get monotone sometimes. FBM culture was from 1980's Culture is mediocre (old school atmosphere even though diversity and inclusion is part of the training). No big technical challenges. Schedules constantly in the red as planning is unrealistic. Good benefits and job security. Pay is average for engineers. Kind Co-workers I have learned lots FEM Skills here at Lockheed. The management has been supportive and does gives moderate amount of pressure but also it helped me being prepared and grow. Good Fun place to work. Given a lot of freedom for your schedule/hours you work and a lot of work is done across teams. Good benefits and compensation. Promotions are pretty straightforward as well. Productive and can be a fun place to work Sunnyvale site is shrinking in size throughout the years. They have difficulties retaining Engineers. Health benefits choices has decrease and copays has increased. Good place to work! Flexible, good pay but not amazing. Rewarding work if you know where to look for it. Gives skills that transfer well to other industries. Most big contractors shuffle engineers around between them. Cool place to work and be apart of space Is great to be apart of the space industry, like most corporate businesses the workers are held to different standards. They continue to reduce wages for lower levels and increase wages for upper management. Old outdated equipment, very little options for offsite training, there's a lot of on site training on your own but all do not apply to my craft. Too many levels of management. Good people and good opportunities Lots of opportunities to do different projects. People are really friendly. Nice facility to work in and you are given the tools needed to do your job. Challenging workplace with opportunities to learn and grow in your role. Great place to work and gain knowledge in several functions of the business. Opportunities to grow but may require you to head for a larger site. Probably the bets work/life balance I've ever seen with flex scheduling, remote working as needed, and Fridays off. Telecommuting options, workplace events such as cookouts, parties, and rewards for hitting team milestones. Healthcare options are mediocre at best. it was good while it lasted I worked for a year as a contractor for the Marine Corp. No room for advancement since it was a contract. My supervisor and the crew I worked with were outstanding. Sucks that the battalion moved to Camp Lejeune. Lockheed paid for my training and I was hoping that they will keep me but I was let go since I didn't move to North Carolina. Great expirience, great people, organization of work task workers get together for post work fun, golf, dining, community events they share childrens school events as well as their personal outside interest. we had a low country boil and thanksgiving we had deep fried turkey pot luck! yum yum lunch was 30 min. if it was an hour I would have ate more and took a nap! Electrical Engineer Pretty good benefits and culture. A lot of people complain about working for a big company but I believe that is a benefit. There are a lot more programs available at a bigger company. I left because the work was tending more towards systems engineering and less electrical engineering. Dependbable employer The company is rather dependable for how they generally treat their staff. There is nothing outstanding about the work environment. Overall was comfortable and liked the people. Terrible. I hated my life when working for this company. They have absolutely no flexibility or desire to promote from within if your an hourly employee. There is a total double standard between hourly and salary employees due to the unions. It was slowly killing my soul. One of the best company to work for. Lifer for Lockheed Martin, majority of members are 20+ years employee for this great company. Now I know why, they know how to treat their employees. Great leadership. Excellent place to work/ Good work life balance Excellent place to work. They have a thing called 9/80 flex which allows you to work your 80 hours over 9 days and get every other Friday off. They are also very accommodating to your schedule and let you count eating lunch at your desk as working time. great place to work. 28 21 Great company Great company, employees, work life manageable, diverse crowd, great benefits. A lot of activities to do outside of work. Flexible schedules if you speak to manager. Overall good facility Great for Veterans and they are desired for hiring Working for the Aerospace industry is satisfying and working with numerous veterans makes the job very enjoyable. Work/Life balance Ever changing undocumented policies due to doing anything the customer wants. 1 Egos abound! Most of the employees (including management) at this location are retired military. Along with that comes huge egos. I've never seen so many grown adults argue for the sake of arguing (and being right!). Very toxic culture. To top it off, the pay is abysmal. Very interesting work Toxic envirnoment, low wages Will make you hate your very existence Anxiety inducing workplace: They'll set you up for failure, then blame you for the mistakes you made that were nowhere in the documentation. They'll also lay the contractors off, claiming there's not enough work to keep you there, then turn around a month later and put out requisitions to those same contractors claiming to be *hiring urgently*. Never again, Lockheed Martin. Never. Again. Not perfect but interesting Lockheed Martin can be a good place to work. You just have to have a positive outlook and be grateful because there are a lot of benefits to working here. Some locations are culturally diverse and others are not, once you get in, you can move around within the company easily and find something that you enjoy. Great company with great benefits Management by in large is friendly and sympathetic to the workers personal issues. For example they accommodated for some health problems I had during my time of employment by letting us have generous amounts of PTO and letting me change positions. Work is easy and not physically strenuous but time is charged to the job so at time things seem to be rushed. Overall a great place to work for Opportunity to move up. LM Is a good place to work, You have a lot of opportunity to move up into a salary position or higher. Some management need some work. But there is a lot of competition with the hourly employees. They will try to make you look bad so they look better. The men don't like women in the aerospace business. The pay is decent General Atomics does pay better. Sick and vacation time is great. All in all it's a great job just be prepared for Not so pleasant coworkers Workers are great, fun people to work with. The work is not the most challenging but the management team leaves much to be desired. There is no advancement pathway from within the company. Plenty of jobs that ask for far to high of candidates. Fun career if you work on development programs A stable, good job that will allow you to move around the company if not satisfied with current role. Management is not present but current manager makes an effort to check-in and ensure you are happy. Working with both young and experience people. Interesting work, Stable, Job Security Managment, Pay, and no internal growth on same team Good work life balance but average pay The work life balance is great. I work 3 days a week at home and once in the office. The job is not particularly hard but the timelines are very thin. Pay could be way better, advancement is slow, and people that don’t deserve it get the raises. Although I can’t complain because management is always supportive. Great career I love here at Lockheed Martin as an assembler. Flex hrs so that you may be able to take care of personal business and family time..the hardest part is the management turn over.. you have to prove yourself to a new manger ever 3 months Good work, management sucks The work is great and the teams are pretty laid back but the management is running the place into the ground. They try to save money anyway possible even if it means taking your money that should be owed to you. Great for entry level engineers Excellent place to work and grow. For new graduates it is a great place to work and understand the responsibilities that comes with each opportunity. Not so easy to move around in the company internally but definitely a great company to work for Advancement Overall a great place to work but if you end up in the wrong area and don’t have any favors saved up advancement is almost impossible. Having a degree is a must unless you’re prepared to make back door deals Detailed work Fun place until it got a lot of new people. Management got bad when they brought in a bunch of outsiders from other states. Insurance sucks but they don't care anymore Great company This is a great company to work for. I have immensely enjoyed my time with Lockheed. The managers and leaders are great and everyone is willing to help you learn and grow. Flexible, Growth Opportunities Repetitive work, childish employees The work is repetitive and not steady. Mismanagement of time and employees by supervision. The culture changes depending on who is promoted. Difficult to advance unless you're part of the click. Good culture and stable job Lockheed will give you a very stable job with good job security doing solid engineering work. 4 day work weeks are nice and pay is competitive for DFW. There are great and helpful people at the company. Lots of support from other employees. Working from home it can be hard getting to know coworkers and ""belonging"". Not many on my team have been promoted even though we have been here for over 2 years and haven't hit level 2. I get 10 hours accrued PTO a month, 40 hours of granted a year, and 18 hours of floating time off in addition to the predetermined holidays off. Great 401k (10% match), flexible work time, Great PTO Production and team work is a plus Production is good to start off with and once you’re there for an year you can bid on another job. It has growth in this company. Just make sure your job performance speaks for itself and show up for work on time. They’re very strenuous on attendance as well on job performance. Team work is very important to this company, it’s just not a one man job. Everyone is willing to help each other out. Be able to float around to learn other jobs in the building you’re working in. There’s a lot of cross training and also lots of training on the computer and also some yearly training in the classroom too. You have to keep up with your certification with your job that you’re assigned too."
Infineon Technologies|" Solid and Multinational Good team, very skilled engineers. Sometimes work can get stressful, deadlines can be unreasonable, but managers are open to discussion and support. A good policy for diversity and inclusion. Nice place to work There is work life balance. colleagues are friendly and ever willing to help and cooperate. Great place to work. Good managers and opportunity for growth. Management and Engineers are a problem Management was quite a joke when he/she does not know what to do nor how the tools we use work. Engineers just like to laze around and creating more problems for the operators. This is based on what I have observed working there for a long time and I would not work with this company again. They also play the favoritism game when hiring people. Dear former employee, thank you for your review. Only through feedback and thus also criticism can we grow and constantly improve. Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us. Regarding recruiting, I can confirm that our Talent Attraction Managers carefully process every application and that personal preference or favoritism does not play a role here. All the best, your Infineon Careers Team Fantastic place to work Working here will keep you busy and moving. It's a shame this location is closing down soon. Management varies by shift, but overall have been very supportive Extraordinary company Incredible growth opportunities lie here, build a future and feel free to stay. You're more than welcome to stay with a vast and diverse team. Infineon technologies are nothing like any company I've worked for, and I won't be leaving anytime soon. focus only on Germany and less on other sites including US it's good if you are in Germany HQ. Otherwise, you will be treated as secondary and less important. Work life balance is good with decent pay. But almost no stocks for US. A Company That Cares I truly feel like Infineon cares about me, my development, my mental health and my family. My manager is a great role model and always willing to help me learn and grow. Work life balance, benefits, trainings and education. Stable company Good work place environment and company culture. Management cares about employees. A bit process-oriented, sometimes too many meetings and internal conference calls No experiences needed just an ok company to work for if you dont have experience. I worked in production line. Management said one thing and did another. The culture and the work are tedious. Depend on your personality, this company did not work for me Productive and organized As soon as you start you begin safety classes and working on tool sets you will be working on. There is required testing to work on the different machines. There not hard , as long as you pay attention it's pretty easy. They are safety and goal oriented. The shifts are long but the days off are worth it.. Great company with low ball salaries The company culture is great but the compensation isn't as great as other semiconductor companies. Also the work life balance is great at Infineon ... High stress-no support If you’re considering working in Finance/Costing at a North American location, do yourself a huge favor and please consider your other options. I was misled during the interview process on what this role fully entails. This is a high stress environment where you will be doing the job of multiple people, with little to no support or training from upper management or the Munich office, and constant 60 hour weeks. Archaic systems, all key data is housed in excel causing all kinds of formatting headaches and snails pace manual processes. Knowing what I know now and what I have experienced working here, I cannot in good conscience recommend working on this team to any prospective candidates. probably good if you work at Campeon Being in the Americas at Infineon puts you at a distinct disadvantage. You are bound by different rules and don't have the perks and benefits that they enjoy at HQ. Good opportunity Upper management is great will support at high level. Middle management not so supportive. Lack experience to lead staff pretty much messengers of the company. Still good company. Stable work schedule and hours. Great first job. Hours are consistent and offers overtime when needs help moving products through the line. Benefits were great as well, however if you're not interested in semiconductor or willing to move up from an entry level operator position, the job becomes lackluster. Good pay, 3 or 4 days off, great benefits Monotonous They treat they people well. I really think they care about their employees. Good company and recommended applying if an opportunity comes up. There are good benefits and good people. Management often gives all hands meetings to keep everyone informed. They are very open to advancing within the company. Productive and fun Amazing work life balance. The schedule I had was 3 days working and every other week we worked 4 days. Not to mention everyone was very friendly and welcoming. very unprofessional work environment, supervisors choose favorites among operators which are more catered to. unprofessional work environment , unethical work treatment, supervisors micromanage operators, they expect you to also sit down and do nothing instead of training you on new tools. short breaks long hours, micromanagement is huge among supervisors and operators, very little chance to move up Not a bad place to intern Internship here is okay, there are projects to do from time to time but depending on how fast you complete your work but you might run out of work fast. Managers are super nice and helpful work hours Great place to work Good reviews. Enjoyed working there. People expected good work and attitude. Was treated with respect and valued your opinions. Wages were well compensated. Great bonuses None Great place to work Great place to work. No complaints. Pleasure working with coworkers. Productive place to work. If you get the right people, it makes the days go by quick and easy. Work schedule 4/3, 3/4. 4 shifts Solid and Multinational Good team, very skilled engineers. Sometimes work can get stressful, deadlines can be unreasonable, but managers are open to discussion and support. A good policy for diversity and inclusion. Stubborn and people stays in one place over 25 years 99% people works in this site more than 25 years and most people used to the way since 25 years ago and insist the way they are doing without problem. Not open mind to learn what's going on outside and trying to get better and better because they think they are the best... 2 Good temp job but no job security It's a great temp job but there is no job security. First shift supervisor is a hot mess. I was to train for two weeks on first shift before going to third shift, which I was hired for. That turned into two months. Then they fired half of the third shift and lied about the reason why. It's a nice place to work . For me ,there was no stress at all, working on my own phase, nice invironment and very nice people around me. Excellent company I've ever work with. Good inviroment. ,good salary , good benefits, was working on my own phase, and meet beautiful nice people who are so very respectful and friendly. Good workplace with great benefits, not very ambitious though Team and workplace is good but job can be dull at times due to overly procedural and restrictive way of working. Still feels very Siemens like culture in that it is a bit of rigid work environment. Good environment, typical large company I feel comfortable to see Asian women in their posters. My boss and colleagues are nice, it’s a very international team. Most managers are German men. Considerate company with both the bottom line and it’s people as top priorities I do believe the European leadership of this company care about both their employees well being and the profitability of the company itself which is rare. The work load is high, hours are long, organizational complexity abound and decision-making is often slow because of it. But all the individual players support and encourage one another for the most part, and there is a generally positive company culture. Bias Management Need to change management especially in Austin Texas, they don't care about their employees. Pay not enough. Management keeps promoting employees that are not even qualified to do their tasks. Training SUCKS!!!! Need new management in ALL department.. Long breaks Bias and Bad management Wonderful work/life balance, terrible management. Twelve hour shifts means lots more time off. It also means that if you’re used to a lot of physical activity, this place will make you think twice on your fourth day of work in a row. My hips won’t ever recover, I think. Even that wasn’t a big deal. Lots of time off means I’ll gladly work through the pain to get there. No, what irks me most is the management that doesn’t seem to care about the amount of pain their employees are in and instead care about production metrics because the size of their bonuses. I was routinely complained at by my manager for sitting to rest for two minutes. Never mind the fact that my bay was in ship shape and all the tools were loaded and working fine. No, that only meant I should find something else to do after having just literally walked two miles in an hour, back and forth from the stocker to the machines in the bay. The job is easy. The managers pushing you to do more, never mind your health, are evil. Sound like a familiar company sharing a name with a rainforest? Insurance is fine. Pay could always be better. Cool that there’s a cafe and convenience store on site, not cool that everything is hilariously overpriced and the cafeteria is the only thing that doesn’t operate 24/7. We were told we should care about production metrics. We were never given any incentive to do so. Raises are too infrequent and too small to be worth concerning yourself with. People are not robots. Stop treating them like they are. Lots of time off. Easy work. Overbearing micromanagement, not paid enough Poorly Managed Working here comes with a lot of unfulfilled promises and lack of appreciation. Compensation is poor and management does not value the effort of its employees. 401k benefits Poor compensation Easy job but can be bad for your mental health. Very easy job once you get the hang of it and the work life balance is great but standing and working the 12 hours you’re there can feel like an eternity. No music or anything to distract you from your thoughts while you’re wearing a smok all day, it becomes mentally and physically exhausting. No growth as I’ve seen people there for years with barely any raises. Depressing and pay isn’t worth it. Work life/Balance Depression Okay Opportunity Working for a global company comes with it's challenges. The environment was very bland, and boring. I was a contracted employee so I didn't feel very included or invested in, but I did enjoy the work and the job served it's purpose for the time being. great team boring Great Place to continue to learn. This was a great place to work for but unfortunately the company has decided to move its facilities outside the US. This site was progressing rapidly but costs more to operate than other locations. Great team environment Good Pay Difficult to progress without a degree Productive work place great place to e Great place to work lots of good people.the department I was employed was probe.i didn’t think that the payed enough for the kind work I was involved in. I had a grate supervisor lots good people Pay was not adequate, in the probe department. Great work/life balance but Management needs to listen At infineon the work/life balance is great. They allow you to take when needed for personal or medical issues. The problem is that Non exempt employees are treated as a lower class than the exempt employees in terms of time off Disability and equal pay. They low ball salaries and rarely listen Co-workers Pay/treatment by Management Interview The interview was so stress free and fun they asked me questions related to coding but it was like I was talking to a big brother and explaining to them. Have never thought that interview process could be so amazing. A competency culture My division was spun off but I was able to work there for 6 yrs. I was both in the USA and Germany, promoted purely on competence and ability to support the customer and company my career was blindingly fast tracked. I loved it, I miss it, and I encourage anyone to seek a company like this or Siemens from where Infineon was rooted. In 6 years I had processes, tools, training and management responsibility like no place since. Thank you for the great experience - diversity, age, gender, and experience - not an impedence for those that were capable anyone could rise to the top. Never saw anyone hired for diversity and never saw anyone held back either...yet they attracted top talent and great performance from everywhere with great benefits and excellent retention. Great place for top performing employees People who want a job for a paycheck not a great place Work Hard Play Hard Infineon is a great place to work. I was never micromanaged. The company isvery flexible and they don't give you a hassle about working remote however you are expected to get your work done. They have a lot of fun activities for team building.its a great company. To many to name Can be clickish A very diversified company with different cultures. This is both an advantage and disadvantage of this company A good company to work for with very good benefits. However work/ personal life balance is a big concern for some employees. Career growth is sometimes dependent on locations/ region . Benefits Life balance what you learned Teamwork is excellent. Want to learn to continues growing. Focus on the company and your individual experience while employed there. workplace culture Great company and culture. Very employee oriented. Great company and culture. Very employee oriented. Solid management and staff and very proactive. Great corporate executive team also. Very down to earth. Solid and Multinational Good team, very skilled engineers. Sometimes work can get stressful, deadlines can be unreasonable, but managers are open to discussion and support. A good policy for diversity and inclusion. It's got a good work environment. Low pay low raise good benefits I suppose I like the work I was doing as a Probe Machine Operator just because I do not like working in a customer service field. You mostly interact with tools instead of people which is a big plus for me. Good job, no job security. Work-life balance Work-life balance at Infineon Technologies is pretty balanced. Usually you would volunteer if you wanted overtime. But they have regular shifts. Pay & benefits My pay and benefits at Infineon Technologies are pay is a little bit low for a tech job in the Silicon Valley, but I guess it matches the work level and skill level as well. Job security and advancement In terms of job security at Infineon Technologies, there is no job security there. 80% of their work is based on mostly government contract work. If work goes bad or gets slow, there goes your job! Management In general, managers at Infineon Technologies are for the most part fair. Culture Collaboration with my colleagues at Infineon Technologies is staff can be rude sometimes. And not very team friendly. Overall My experience working at Infineon Technologies started good, but ended bad. Management started making mistakes causing problems with employees. Shift managers at times were negligent, allowing employees to misbehave. Great place to work! The culture at Infineon is always uplifting and it won't take long for you to call them family! The company is truly process-oriented and I find that very pleasant. Collaboration is key and everyone is willing to pitch in to help whenever is needed. Flexibility, Culture, Benefits. If you are not process oriented, buckle up! Fab operator Good place to start in the semiconductor business but limited growth potential. To much favoritism and not enough opportunities for growth or advancement. Terrible company, avoid. Terrible company. Barely gave me any training the first week, then they decide to terminate me before my last week of training can be complete because I'm 'not responding to the training'. Multi billion dollar company that expects the most out of its workers, but can't give a decent wage, even for those who have been certified or have spent years with the company. Unless you're management or have a degree in electrical engineering your chances of making a livable wage at this company is almost 0%. There are factories all over Leominster where long time employees are getting paid 25-30 dollars an hour. Look elsewhere. Easy work, air conditioned, easy schedule. Terrible training, boring, almost no promotion opportunities, very little pay. This place needs better management -Needs better management. -Need to treat everyone equal. -Better pay for the type of job they do. . Good technologies Good fabrication technologies but weaker system knowledge. German will definitely help in technology side. have world class fabs no salary perks(low salary) Productive and a fun workplace I learn a lot while I was working for this company. The people were nice to work with and the facility was really very much conducive workplace. I meat variety of people and my boss was very professional, Great company Company culture is fantastic! Work life balance Room for advancement Upper management is friendly and supportive Open door policy and ability to approach colleagues and management Great work experience I've learned more about electrical troubleshooting and mechanics than I ever would have learned in school. The team I work with is extremely helpful and willing to teach me so that I can thrive in being the best at what I do. Benefits are good not sure how much longer they will be in operation Great worklife balance Great company and great people but difficult to move within company. Learn alot about power managemen devices and lots of training opportunties. Workplace culture is casual. Sometimes a bit too bureaucratic. Great company to work for Great company to work for as far as benefits and employee morale. Usually a fast-paced company when the work is available. Management will pull every string imaginable to keep their employees. More slowdowns than anything. Unfortunately, my strong work ethic was destroying my overall moral of feeling productive due to the lack of production. I would highly recommend this company if your work ethic consist of working at 100%, then slowing down to long intervals of long slow hours with zero work. Due to the awesome management securing jobs, the constant shut-downs will financially hit you. I made great friends here, so the family-oriented concepts truly exist with Infineon Technologies. Awesome company to work for. great work/life balance With the right manager and colleagues, it is enjoyable to work at Infineon. I would not hesitate to go back again. HR team is great, managers are supportive. flexibility, work/life balance, supportive management sometimes could be more efficient Good working environment Infineon is a good company for people that seeking to work full time job, as part of the company working assembly job, I can see that the company really focusing on employees safety, also making sure employees have a fair, good working environment. Good people to work with A typical day was working with other engineers to solve interesting and complex problems related to Cellular Base Station amplifiers. The people are friendly and there is a supportive team environment. If this location wasn’t closing! My time here has been very rewarding and I could see a great deal of growth for anyone not afraid to work if it wasn’t sadly closing this location soon. Good pay and benefits Pay there interns well. I have learned quite a bit at the internship. They give good benefits. Everyone I have met has been very nice they are a diverse company Productive This company has life balance good compensations and benefits job culture, job security and good management. Good work environment. I highly recommend to work in this company. Easy work with fun people Would continue to work here if the base pay and raises we more fare to everyone. This company is plagued with politics, favoritism, and rude attitudes from people with higher office salaries. Great and clean work environment This is a great place to work. The environment is a clean room. The shifts were 12 hours but you only worked 3-4 days a week. Learned so much about machine production here. Solid and Multinational Good team, very skilled engineers. Sometimes work can get stressful, deadlines can be unreasonable, but managers are open to discussion and support. A good policy for diversity and inclusion. Mangement is sucks There is no good trainig department. There is no good benifts. There is no appreciate at work. Too much favouritism at work. There is no good communication at work. 2 Lots of favoritism, catering to the younger employees Company with good benefits, advancement only to the younger Operators, lot of favoritism and not equal opportunity for advancement to level up and promote, unless you have the right supervisor. Sadly lacking integrity in the work place. 2 team work paid less work more pay less. manager and supervisor are not friendly. not pay good wages. short lunch time. good team works. training ok. work more pay less Decent company bad managment Infineon has all the tools it needs to help employees, but management has its own agendas and they aren't help the employee its help themselves. there is a very noticeable separation between management and the average employee and it is to bad because I wouldn't call the company bad just the management teams in place. and because the corporate office is so far away I believe the corporate office is in the dark because the onsite HR person if you can call her that since she is only onsite twice a week is on the management side of the fence. Good Environment was good, co-workers were friendly, safe area. medical supervisors not really accesible Very rewarding in higher positions A very good place to work if you like to constantly be moving. However management can be a little to preoccupied with the job and neglect the needs of the employee. Reasble good place to work Management was good, then political change for another manager who was horrible. Lots of training, many conference calls, good if you are good at a political environment. Lots of friendly people there. My shift was from 8 to 5 or 9 to 6, which ever was needed. Over the course of the 17 years I worked there I work all of the shifts. I learned all aspects of failure analysis. I learned delayering, decapsulation, cross-sections. I used microscopes and SEM's. Management was good. The culture was also good. The hardest part of the job getting participation in the Five S system. The most enjoyable part of the job was working on the FET's and IC's The manager has trusted for the employee to do the work without micromanaging. I love to work there with the great environment and friendly co-workers. I would recommend to work there. Regards to benefits, I believe it is good and fair to the employees. Security Officer Infinion is one of the places one looks forward working at--all employees are helpful and friendly I have learned what is required as far as the procedures of the bldg. I have also did some shipping.receiving-greeting the clients {new and current} in a professional and friendly manner-The management is very helpful -also passing out badges to visiting clients- Great place to work, but not enough money I look forward to going to work. Coworkers are great. In just the few years I have been here, my work has doubled, yet never a raise. Or not a truly noticeable one. In my position at work, my attendance is vital. Yet, I feel I'm not being compensated substantial enough. Great company to work for Can't live off the pay. Need a second job Infineon is a great place to work Infineon is an Austrian based company who believes in investing in its newly acquired talent by send ing the new employee where ever needed to get the specific knowledge about the product and its use in applications. This is followed by yearly refreshers. M anagement is very likable and fair. Promotion is based upon abilities anbd not personalities. Get the job done correctly and on schedule and you are in phase with the company . TCompany merges affected my career Due to company merges, my career was deeply affected. Management hide some deep issues prior the merges, that caused a financil crisis in my division New mnagement was not willing to listen/fix underline issues, and prefer the parent company employees over the merged company This cused major laid offs due to managemeant inadecquencies to react in a timely manner, despite our recommendtions Technology Market Leader Merger caused massive laid offs and financial crisis Not a fun place to work due to poor political working enviroment. Working at Infineon was a fun experience. There were device prediction models to simulate to shorten design cycle. It is very helpful to compare simulation results and actual test bench measurements. Good big corporation, some departments are great If they weren’t going to close down the facility in 1-2 years it would be a great place to work. Over 600 people are going to be laid off. Out of 750 they said 150 or less will stay onboard. Mostly design and marking/sales. Facility is very old but well maintained. My supervisor was great. Some BS drama with some sections, as is typical in such a large place. Cafe onsite, pay OK, most people nice Plant being shutdown. Very big global corporate mentality. Management words does not match actions Was told quality counts, but only care about quantity. Production and maintenance leads are “good ole boys”, performance and hard work means nothing except that you’ll be the one doing all the work while the long timers/ good ole boys get to do nothing but eat, sleep, surf internet/watch movies. And these good ole boys will disrespect you, belittle you, rude, think they’re better than you. NOT a fun place to go to work. They give free coffee, random donuts and cakes, and thinks this makes it a great place to work. Trying real hard to think of one Very long list.....start with disrespect from leads production and maintenance Well worth it even if a temp From the day you have orientation, you’re treated as if you’re a permanent member of the company. Very relaxed. They actually care about all their employees. Very flexible and very understanding. Enjoy to work with infineon One of the best company I work for a long time. friendly coworker, a lof of help, People friendly and very cooperate The boss is helping when you are in trouble Dead end job Was promised advancement in the company, took the most difficult certifications and got next to nothing. They use you up and take advantage of you. All about numbers and ""beating"" the other shifts. Pay for what you do is not worth it. Hours Company shutting down, making uneccesary changes, low pay, bad management Great place, motivational driven people Fast paced environment. Lots to learn. Everyone is helpful and encourages everyone to learn and strive to be the best they can be. Management can use a little work but overall great people. Hardest part of the job would be getting used to different types of work ethics and personalities surrounding you. Solid and Multinational Good team, very skilled engineers. Sometimes work can get stressful, deadlines can be unreasonable, but managers are open to discussion and support. A good policy for diversity and inclusion. Might've been the best job I've had I lessened a lot at Infineon Technologies. It was my first picking job. I also packed and shipped customer orders. I learned how to ship customer products via UPS and FedEx through UPS/FedEx automated programs. I dealt with international customers. Had to leave Infineon Technologies moved production back to it's home country in Germany. Learned the basic warehouse functions Company left America Good place to work with the right shift A typical day at work starts immediately as you enter the cleanroom. While there you will be working constantly as there is little to no downtime. However, there are two paid thirty minute breaks and one unpaid 45 minute lunch. Working here has taught me great time and risk management skills as well as the ability to train others in my line of work so that they can go about their daily duties more effectively. Management here is good when they are directly above you but there is a severe disconnect past direct reports to your immediate manager. Thankfully, you don't often have to report to those above your immediate manager. Workplace culture is up beat and with the right shift (being 1,2,3,4) swing shifts. The hardest part of the job is making sure you don't fall behind. This requires an individual who can keep ahead of their workflow constantly while being able to function independently. While you can rely on others from time to time to pick up slack this will eventually be viewed in a negative context. The most enjoyable part of the job are my fellow employees. free breaks unpaid lunch, high stress environment to meet deadlines 2 I liked what I saw. I worked for 3 months during the summer. I was physically located at the IBM facility. I was mostly working with engineers that were native Germans. It was a pleasant experience. Nice environment Far from my family at the time Professional and organized Infineon is a company whose performance is based on employees, organization and products quality. As a salesperson, it is very pleasant to work at Infineon because the value of the word given to customers is always respected. To continue to grow/evolve, Infineon should be more open to international culture (still german centric) culture is hard to fit in Infineon is a big company with a lots of opportunities. However the sites are not local, if you are in a small site like one in Leominster it is not that easy to grow in this company Unappreciated Had top production moves but was unappreciated. Worked us like slaves. Globalist mind set. Company itself has high tech aspirations such as 5g and smart dust Cool coworkers Robot like management fast pace and simple job management needs improvement Easy and simple work place. They offer both overnight and day time shifts. Lots of days off but hours are long. Compensation is ok but no room to move up. lot of days off long hours Good people Infineon has great people working for the company. They are selling the fab plant, so very little opportunity for advancement. They have non-standard Planning systems that take a long time to get used to. Great people and work environment Very little growth opportunities Decent place to work Professional environment. Good people to work with. Better than average benefits (PTO). My position was very demanding and I worked a lot of long hours. Good company Infineon is a great company. Good people, steady workflow, safe environment, and overall great company. I am thankful for my time with them and skills I learned. Good work environment No potential for improvement They love when you do overtime Everyone gets hired on as a temp first and overall it was okay. They let you do as much over time as you like which was really nice. However, management was not so great. They will lead you on thinking you'll be the next one offered full time then randomly end your contract. Worst place to work Always direct hire people who are relatives to management. Hiring contract people from left to right without any experience. Very low pay and small breaks. The management always worry about quantity than quality. Employee training is very poor. If you make any mustake during training you can lose your job. Fun place to work Relaxed environment. While there we did desktop support, Inventory of assists, deployment of a new phone systems. was a friendly environment to work in, Great People Management did not respond in a timely manner n/a I have nothing else to say on this company except im so happy that im not working in this company anymore because this company is so stressful that's all. Overall, a very good company. Overall, a very good company. Cutting edge technologies and very good seasoned engineers. Excellent insurance benefits. Employees have willingness to help each other. Productive fast-paced environment that can be relaxing I loved this job. I loved being able to be given a task and be able to just do my work and listen to music. It was reasonably easy work, just had to pay attention to the numbers on the parts. Relaxing environment with appropriate breaks Very secure environment. Needed a badge to get into the building, badge and fingerprint to clock in and out Good Employer Infineon provided a positive and motivating environment, and offered opportunities for personal growth and development. The provided benefits were above industry standards, and included free meals. Management was approachable and rewarded employees who contributed to process improvement initiatives Free lunches Unstaible industry Everyone Worked as a team I worked in various departments at Infineon, and the people and man agement was great. When a project needed to be completed everyone would jump in to help. We also did a lot of fun events. Manger would go around each day to each employee and ask how they were doing and if they needed help with anything. It was awesome. Great Diverse Company It was only a temporary position My manager was enjoyable to be around I learned a lot about RF technology and met some very good people and enjoyed my time there for the most part. I had hoped to be hired on permanent but it never was going to happen. My manager her manager Great Opportunity Great people to work with and lots of opportunity to advance. High pace and fully of energy best describes a typical day. Pay and extra perks such as bonuses were great incentives to do your best."

You just never know when you will lose your job. Pay is pretty good with good benefits. Decent pay, long days The pay is decent, but you work long days on your feet the majority of the time. High turnover rate leads to those that stick around having to pick up the slack. Lots of opportunity for overtime and incentive pay. Workplace Good company, but terrible management. Management have no filters on how he is feeling for that they either saying we suck or just using profanity towards supervisor Best warehouse associate they ever seen To be honest. At the location in Phoenix,AZ they are not the best place to work in my experience. I focused and worked hard at this location for going on three years and thier focus was on proferming and working thin the employees. I don't recommend you apply here unless it's your last option and you want to stop seeing family members. Never see the day light I'd sleep all day. 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? The peace and pay What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Getting there What is the work environment and culture like at the company? It cool I can't complain. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Work,and go home. The people are really good and they don't micro. Meh The experience was a learning one. When training you will shadow with So many different people it will be hard to determine what Is the correct procedure. Please don’t get on Management bad side as you will be singled out every time!! I’m not sure if this is the environment for all of the programs but the one I was working on I got harassed Daily. Overall it’s a great place to work jus make sure you get on a program with Good management. All equipment is sent to you. Too much to list 2 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Being able to work remote What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Company making major changes and taking away Nurses jobs and not providing hardly any information about it What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Co workers are awesome! What is a typical day like for you at the company? Busy Busy Busy No longer a trusted company to work for Previously this was an awesome company to work for. As of the middle of September, as a DMNE for Lash Group it is not. Over 300+ nurse positions are being eliminated by April 2023 and over 70 have left, which is why they are now hiring again. No severance, because you still have a job if you want it, it's just now non nursing case management with a $20+ an hour paycut. Your job will not be secure. This will continue through the other groups, and this is not a prediction, this was told in a ""town hall meeting"". Clearly someone in upper management wrote that other review in October who gave them 5 stars. They also have keystroke monitoring equipment which they implemented over the last couple weeks. This tracks any and everything you do or do not do on your computer. RUN FROM THIS COMPANY, DO NOT APPLY. Thankfully I've got another wfh job lined up, others are still struggling to find one. Hopefully they will find one with a better CEO. Pretty nice place to work I think that I am lucky to have landed a job here. The hours are reasonable, And the team is nice. The work is engaging and the management has been understanding. I guess my only criticism is that I wish the benefits were better than average. Chill place to work Not much else to say. I think that the things I was taught as a SWE was really relevant, and I appreciated just how chill and interesting it was to work there. 2 stars What is the best part of working at the company?

Leads act like they are better than you What is a typical day like for you at the company? Lift 20-70 pounds all day Good place to work Rewarding job, good environment. Good culture and family atmosphere. Fast paced environment but you are rewarded with incentive pay. The faster you work the more opportunity you have to make more money. Micromanaged AB is getting rid of nursres to hire lay people to do the role we fulfilled. Calling them case managers without have a degree. Many people have already left and more are daily. Great benefits but disorganized Great health benefits and ability to take volunteer time off. When I first started, it was a great place to work and you would get your request off for PTO. People were very helpful and encouraging. As time went on, it became hard to ask for time off and micromanagement started. I don't recommend starting as a nurse navigator at this time as the nurse role is being combined with another role and your getting the short end of the stick. Rewarding Great place to work. Work life balance, great benefits. Competitive pay along with incentive pay for those that exceed the expectations. Management tenurship. 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Great manager What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Taking time off What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Excellent What is a typical day like for you at the company? Exciting to work there All production and no humanity Not that your job needs to be fun mandatory but this place inspired me to reassess my life and look towards a new career path. They want you to be robotic and fake sounding as possible and seek to control every word you say. Pros: Remote work friendly Cons: Mandatory Overtime as soon as you hit the floor! Micro management They mirror your screen, schedule all your breaks and lunches, nick pick everything you do!!!! I do not recommend this company . If you have an appointment and you do not schedule it 2 weeks in advance, you will receive an occurrence Great benefits and pay Great company to work for. As a PAC (team lead) WORK LIFE BALANCE COULD BE BETTER. WE have to fight for days off. And only one of us can be off on any given day. That is a huge issue. But it is overall a great place to work. Great pay and beneftis No work life balance no flexibility 1 Decent place to work I've worked here for over 4 years. Management is very good. They offer bonuses which is nice. I would definitely recommend the company. Benefits are okay. 1 Great place to work I am a former employee. I look back very fondly of working there. The people were great and I probably had one of the best managers I've ever had in my career. I looked forward to going to work. people none Good place to work and nice work environment It's nice to work here, the company has good benefits and the work environment it's really great, Managers are kind, comfy break room with Tv's and clean. The trainer is good and he teaches you with clear information and he is so kind. Good benefits, fair pay remote is nice- i loved my team but there is not much room to move up without being a robot and doing everything your manager says even if he is completely wrong. very political. Warehouse worker Best company to work for great management and great benefits. Pay is very good. The manager are very respectful and caring. They give you breaks and the break room is big . 2 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Benefits and pay are good. Working from home provides better work/ life balance. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Poor management: Micromanaging, lack of standardized procedures and, poor verbal and written communication. Procedures change from week-to-week, no consistency at all. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Extremely toxic work environment. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Complete chaos. No day is the same. Because things are constantly changing week-to-week, there little to no routine. Fun place to work The company is great to work for. Lots of room to grow within the company. I will come back when my program ends. I love the mangers. They were great. Good benefits and pay work is more than 8hrs no specific time to end. lots heavy boxes, Management have preferences. Rules are for new people not for the rest. Need to meet a percentage if not you will get fired. benefits, pay too much work, extremely heavy boxes, not ending time Challenging but awesome workplace I enjoy working here. Pay is average. The workload can be heave at times but manageable. The time off and medical is generous and above average. Overall I love it there. no long term stability, they lose contracts, or cut budgets ....run Metrics change often to prevent bonus payouts. What previous surpassed metrics required now would not even meet. Micromanaged, screenshots and recording, no trust. Have never worked for an organization that treats people with a degree like a second class citizen. Perhaps because many at the top since reorg do not have any formal training? We are now encouraged to apply for positions that do not require a nursing degree, but management will not share salary. To cut costs nursing will be replaced with non clinical employees. What used to be white glove service will no longer be. This is the best company I have ever worked for in the 40 years that I have been working Love working for this company. They give a lot of good bonuses depending on productivity and quality. They pay well and I get positive feedback from my supervisor. Work life balance, lots of PTO, good pay, good insurance that doesn't cost a lot for a single person. repetitive work can get boring. Great place to work Overall this is a great place to work. They make sure you are well trained and knowledgeable about product. The teams worked great together and the pay is great. Excellent training and team environment and the pay was great. System downtime and IT issues - caused unfair production results and scores. 60hr Work Week This company wouldn't be bad at all, but they seem to want you to work around 55-60hrs a week. The benefits and time off are great, you get 3 weeks vacation time a year right out of the gate. Nice people Ok place to work. Still growing facility so lots of kinks to work out. Machines already breaking so have to fix. Have to fix problems that were left behind by contractors Run away Please do yourself a favor and don’t work here, management is unprofessional and show favoritism. Some of the staff members are straight up perverts. You end up working long hours some nights because it’s short staffed from people quitting or calling in. They have a timed system for everyone in the building which is rigged, broken and absolutely useless. save yourself the stress and leave this place alone. ITS MISERABLE The pay is nice So far the work experience is meh. Micromanagement, rude condescending, constantly pinging you to complete things you’ve already completed. Let’s not mention constantly having to repeat yourself. Good starter job, Get experience and get out Good place to get pharma experience. No work/life balance or appreciation. Mgmt favoritism, tattle tale behavior reward. New hires paid more than current employees. Promotions based on Pet standing as much as skill or experience. MANDATORY OT. Bully employees not disciplined, ex: that's just Linda. Good workers are worked hard, lazy pets are not expected to do much. First shift is the worst due to too many managers. Second/third shift managers are more fair. Still favoritism but not nearly as bad. Remote Work. Fair compensation. Fair pay. Opportunity to earn bonuses. Remote work. Saves money on gas/commute time. Could use some compensation for electricity/wifi/phone. Hard to schedule time off even though PTO is good. I feel encouraged and praised. Overall I am very happy at my job as a Telehealth Nurse. Like any place there are pluses and minuses. PTO. Good salary. Remote work. Hard to schedule time off. Would be nice to have some compensation for electricity/Internet/phone/ It's okayyyyy The benefits are great.Pay isn't too bad. Bonuses and free food are pluses too. However,there is definitely favoritism.It can be a quite ""clique-ish"" environment. And some of the management likes to boss instead of lead.There are people that are very helpful and friendly in there also.It can be very stressful and physically demanding. Good job Pay is good and great benefits I I’ve the job people are friendly management was cool anc laid back as long as you do your work.. they also feed you training was good as well Great benefits and pay Great company to work for. As a PAC (team lead) WORK LIFE BALANCE COULD BE BETTER. WE have to fight for days off. And only one of us can be off on any given day. That is a huge issue. But it is overall a great place to work. Great pay and beneftis No work life balance no flexibility 1 Good place to work Good place to work, very flexible when need be. Management doesn't really care, but if you're on a good team you will be successful. They do offer a decent work from home policy, but it depends on the team. Most people never have to come in, but some teams require it. Work from home 1 Great company I worked for them through a temp agency. Great company, good pay, treated employees nice. Professional atmosphere. Was offered a position directly through the company but couldn’t accept until my contract was over with temp agency. Awful place to work Absolutely terrible place to work. The hours were long, they would keep you there for mandatory overtime sometimes up to 14 hour shifts because the equipment was always breaking. My working hours were supposed to be 430-1 AM and sometimes I wouldn’t get home until 7 AM. I was so depressed at this job I truly became suicidal. The supervisors were also not great. I would never, ever recommend working here to anybody. Dumpster Fire Lash decided to let go about 30% of their people managers and add in multi levels of IT. I am not sure who decided this but now they don't have enough people managers for a call center. But trust assured IT is a cluster! Clients beware. Just Work Ok place to work, some managers have very little experience and directors are just toxic, keep your head down and stay busy and you will be fine. Good place to learn the business then move on. Ok place to work I liked working there. Only complaint I there is alot of favoritism. Those employees get away with doing so much less. Not really fair but it happens. Productive fast paced work environment Easy fast paced work environment. Good health benefits and paid leave policy. Friendly working conditions and appreciation functions throughout the year. flexiblity none Disorganized Managers do not know how to do the actual work. The phone system is rubbish. The CRM they use sucks and the provider portal is riddled with issues. Lots of calls from patients who made an application and never heard back. Constantly changing rules. Watching healthcare in America not working for patients. Trying to help people get access to pricey medications but mostly having to listen to people cry, talking about suicidal thoughts, and medical issues. Calm and inclusive work environment I have not been for a long time yet, but my first impressions are great. There is structure and clear guidance at all times. The culture here is inclusive and there is room for a lot of opportunity to develop and grow. good place to work I had to leave it because I had to move to another city but I liked the job the pay was good and you had a life for the family I recommend it I would come back if I could Productive and very encouraging company. Very encouraging and uplifting company to work for. Lots of autonomy, that will help you in your future endeavors. Very in depth training process, I had one of the best trainers ever. Good for money but that's it!!!! This is a good company to get on with if you're looking for a way to get fast cash and a lot of hours. But this is not a good company to try to have a future with. This company will not let you succeed. You could be the hardest working person there and you're still just a number not a person. The management is always busy having fun and goofing off, and not taking their job seriously. They will do everything in their power to keep you from getting a raise, even though this company brings in over 250 million a quarter. No one here is made to hit their rates so you will live at work for 12-14 hours a day, five days a week. If the workload gets too heavy to finish up in a workday they will have you work Saturday as well. The people that run this company will make you all kinds of promises and then they will let you fail. This is not a place to pursue a career. If you're going into management or an office job get ready to have fun everyday at work, be very relaxed, have lots of snack breaks, stand around and talk and joke with certain employees, as long as the medicine gets on the trucks it just doesn't matter. I have never had a job in my life that has caused me so much stress and despair. The employees that have worked there for ten years make less than people walking in the door today. No place for advancement. It's like a high school, drama and favoritism all over the place. Please do yourself a favor and don't work here if you're looking for a future. If you need some quick cash definitely a good option, but get out as soon as you can!!! Money, 15 minute breaks Favoritism, lies, long days, don't care about you, management, doesn't enforce rate Rewarding place to work if you love helping people Overall the company is a very good company to work for. They are very inclusive. PTO is generous and so is the pay. Typical workday is assisting patients find different therapies to help with medication. Love my manager and team. Sad they were bought out This company was great! I was excited about working for them and was learning so much about specialty prescriptions and what the rules were for each one of them. I was a temp but was hoping to get hired permanently but CVS bought them out and then they are now going to lay off all the people that had been working there for years. Easy job. Easy place to work, very laid back culture, climate controlled warehouse. Management is friendly and tries to resolve issues but has a tendency to keep falling back on what they have always done and expecting different results. Maternity Leave/Experience Level Overall I rate AmerisourceBergen a 4/10. It’s a great job for people who want to retire soon or older individuals. They don’t do a great job at teaching you things, a lot of stuff I knew I had to learn myself. I was also only approved for one month off after I gave birth which really sucks. Good Pay No Help/Assistance, No Work-Life Balance Great benefits Offers great benefits package. The work environment is good with opportunities for advancement for those highly motivated individuals. One of the downsides is the amount of hours worked each week. Good place to go Good place to work but must network to move internally frequently. Programs will come and go, always look for the next role. Lots of different companies underAB. Company has a poor culture Company pays a great salary and benefits if that is important to you. The company is not supportive if you are not a legacy employee (5 or more years). Company is not inclusive and Diversity is not a priority. As long as they make money and keep their fortune 10 status. The company lacks innovative, very fragmented and does not invest in efficiency or development. Leadership is HORRIBLE and this is due to the company being in a niche market so there is no incentive to evolve. Again, if money is priority then it’s the company for you. If you’re looking for Innovation, growth and to make a difference stay clear. Fun workplace but a little streesful I really enjoyed working for them. Everyone was really nice and the employer/employee relationships were awesome. They showed a lot of respect for their employees and the pay was pretty good. The only thing I didn’t like is they kept stringing us along saying they were going to hire someone full time (this was a temporary position) and then didn’t hire anyone so it kind of felt like they were telling empty promises. Great benefits and pay Great company to work for. As a PAC (team lead) WORK LIFE BALANCE COULD BE BETTER. WE have to fight for days off. And only one of us can be off on any given day. That is a huge issue. But it is overall a great place to work. Great pay and beneftis No work life balance no flexibility 1 Little room for advancement I have a master's degree in leadership, but I have not been able to move up in this company. The work is enjoyable, but I wish there was more room for advancement. 1 1 AB is a good place to work They have good benefits including tuition reimbursement and A positive culture. I have only worked on site even during Covid so unsure if remote workers are satisfied working from home. 1 Great place to work Really love the work I do clean environment and all around good place to work. The staff are friendly and helpful. Managers encourage your production Good healthcare insurance I was not paid for the hours I worked. This seems to be a habitual habit for this employer according to other employees. This is not acceptable behavior for a company that is the 8th wealthiest company in the U.S. The schedule I was told in the interview is not the schedule that I had to work. A little overtime but not much in my opinion. Very easy job but on your feet the entire time. Very clean facility Only 30 minutes for lunch Productive and fun working environment When I was working at AmerisourceBergen I enjoy every minute every second I spend there working there it was really great.working environment the managers the supervisor were nice and friendly they were making sure we do the job the right way so I really really love AmerisourceBergen and it was a great work environment for teens adults everyone so I do recommend this company . The hardest part is working over on Monday and Tuesday. The best part about working here was the 3 day weekend. Some departments have a lot of turn over because of the way the work gets distributed. Sometimes you may work in the cooler, sometimes you maybe a forklift driver, other times you may do put away but all jobs pay the same even though some jobs are harder than others. good company however overwhelming It is ok depending on what you are really looking for. Found the job was did not pay much but the staff were ok and easy to get along. There is a volume of calls and emails to handle, no flexibility. benefits and training short breaks and PTO scheduling Good place to work!. I work there many years ago. I would go back, easy work but u got to do it accurately. No error... Because it it medication and people need it. For what I remember management was great.. They appreciate what u do... A lot of overtime!. It could be perfect if the managers could get along with works more The place isn’t bad if you just trying to make money, the only problem is some of the managers. They seem to have what most people call “favoritism” and it really shows and stands out sometimes. Great Team My team worked well together but when people call out we never receive support. No training for advancement is offered. Job posting are no longer made available, positions are filled by friends of supervisors. Nice place to work This place is a nice place to work. Good benefits. Sometimes long hours but overall great place to work for. I don't have any complaints in the time I worked there. To keep as short as possible... Too much mandatory overtime, whether day-to-day not having a clear end time or weekends, anyone in management can give you direction and they all have different/conflicting opinions, some unprofessional staff, not all leadership is respected and it reflects, people expect others to quit quickly so they don't bother even trying to make new employees feel welcome in the first place, two week training had nothing to do with the actual job, outdated computer systems that can hinder doing the job properly, can go on but I'm tired Free lunch each Wednesday Everything else Productive and fast paced work environment Not a bad place to start off working. Definitely not a job you want to stuck at forever if all your doing is selecting. But if you can show your worth in move up, then maybe worth it. Get ready for your feet to hate you. It was garbage Management was horrible, and if you want a job that you can spend time with your family this isn’t it. Also, they have favorites, so if you’re trying to move up in the business then you are going to have a really bad time. Good Company, Dysfunctional Management. Amerisource can be a good company to work for, the jobs in the facilities are pretty straightforward and with working in medicine gives the added bonus of the job feeling worth it, as you are helping patients get the medication they need. The company does offer very good PTO, compensation, and room for advancement. However the facility has been plagued with revolving leadership, which has led to issues of long hours, and dysfunction between the departments/shifts. 3 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Work from home What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Making your productivity 6 days 12 hours shift. This job will make u stay 12 hours every day. Bad management. this job is union job. Union is bad too. Senority plays a part as well. If this job is just 8 hours . This job would be perfect. You a prisoner for 12 hours. Easy work. All the putaway are done by receiving team even when they have a putaway team. Abc depend on the Receiving team. At last this branch need to hires real replenishment team from 9am-5pm . M-F. Just cut all day ,receiving team will get out on time. Job is 6-230pm but you will never see 230pm . You definitely see 4pm every day you off Great work environment if you are flexible and organized I have been with the company for a year and am very satisfied with my position. Although there are problems with communication from middle management at times if you know your role and are willing to put forth effort you will succeed. There are expectations for amounts of calls per hour etc, but it’s easily managed if you are willing to do the work. Not everyone is disciplined enough for remote work and if you are not disciplined then you won’t succeed. This is a position that makes you take ownership of your daily tasks and you have to be willing to put in the effort. I’m very happy with my position. A fine place to work Working remotely, so can’t comment on any accommodations in the office, but overall a positive work environment, management who seem to care and want you to do a good job, and decent pay for a relatively skill free job. The work I do is fairly repetitive, and can get pretty dull, but it’s not hard at all. Nice people, easy work Processes change a lot, can be a little hard to keep up with You'll Recommend It to Friends/Family The only negative I have to say about this company is it's unfortunate they are ending the Benefit Verification Specialist position and transitioning to automatic positions. They are laying all of us off, but not giving us a set date to expect to be let go. However, they're pretty great as far as the BVS position goes. Hands on management, feedback on ways to grow, flexible time off requests. Pretty great company. Remote, Flexible, Hands-On Management, Good Pay Health Insurance is Not Great, Not Many Occurrences Allowed Great benefits and pay Great company to work for. As a PAC (team lead) WORK LIFE BALANCE COULD BE BETTER. WE have to fight for days off. And only one of us can be off on any given day. That is a huge issue. But it is overall a great place to work. Great pay and beneftis No work life balance no flexibility 1 Good benefits Overworked, paid fairly, good amount of paid time off and affordable insurance, they will not hesitate to let you go so you must actually do your job. Overall not a terrible place to work it pays the bills 1 Ok place to work It’s a okay place to work if you like long hours. Some of the leads don’t know what’s going on. High turn over rate. Sunday thru Thursday day shift is the worst to work. Pay Hours 1 Pay good. Hours stink. Management stinks. You stay till the work is done. So 12 hour days are common. You get the overtime. Only 1 great supervisor on dayshift. Upper management is a joke. No communication between departments. Coworkers are great. We do have a lot of fun despite being miserable. If you need a job, it’s ok and it pays well especially with all the overtime. Insurance is really good, but if you smoke you have to pay additional fees. Overall, would not recommend because of all the bull Demanding work with minimal support from Management Your operations managers spend too much time analyzing computer generated productivity figures without knowing what is actually happening on the floor. Training is lacking. One hundred or more employees depend on one training person. No written SOP for any position is provided and productivity guidelines seem to change randomly. Pay is average but demands on workers are way above average Air conditioning Petty management Eh Nothing really good. Make your money and go home. Management isn't the greatest . Alot of turnover within management so you'd never know who you'd be working under for too long It was fine. Yust be at work do your job and don't try to be too popular with others remember that you sing a contract to do a job for serten hours Yust go by the rules and you going to be fine 👍 Great company It was great while it lasted, the best company I ever worked for. I have nothing negative to say about this company more than I wish I could have worked for them longer. Overall a great place to work I loved working for AmerisourceBergen. My only criticism is that mid-level management isn’t always free to make decisions needed in order to be more efficient & productive. Corporate headquarters too often pushes down decisions with little knowledge of the overall impact on business. Socially aware organization Love the value this company places on their employees. I can’t say anything bad because I personally don’t feel that way! Leadership seems to appreciate their staff at all levels. Unhappy working as a DMNE I still work here, but I'm actively looking for a new job. A typical day at this job is to read from a script during calls. If you don't follow the script or guidelines, then you fail the call. You are expected to make 3- 3.5 calls per hour. Your metrics depend on your charting as well as the score of your calls. You are micromanaged and have to use a specific aux code for everything that you do. Policies change weekly here and you basically have to work OT to keep up with their policies, training modules, meetings, licensure and etc. If you try to complete these things during your work shift, then it lowers your calls per hour, and you don't meet your quota. The turnover is high here, and now I finally understand why. Despite trying to have 300 DMNEs onboard, we are barely able to keep up with inbound calls as well as outbound tasks. There are 10,000+ outbound tasks that still need to be completed. Management shows favoritism and they exclude those that they don't like. My manager acts like she is too busy to acknowledge or respond to me. They frequently deny PTO requests. Micromanagement goals are stressful. There is a high turnover. They only allow people to work 8 hour shifts. Management sent out a survey asking people if they would like to work 10 or 12 hour shifts instead, but then they never discussed this again. Reading from scripts and talking with unhappy patients on the phone all day, while struggling to reach your call quota, does not feel fulfilling. In summary, I wouldn't recommend working as a DMNE. Professional solid company AmerisourceBergen is a solid, professional company where you will be treated fairly. The work of a patient care coordinator can be monotonous, but if you focus on connecting with and helping your clients, you will do well. The pay rate is above average for the industry. I felt like my managers and supervisors had my best interests at heart, but it take a long time to move up in this company. great health insurance, exceptional PTO and holiday pay can get stuck in your role Customer care position Dallas TX It's an easy job but team supervisor was something else. I would recommend this job to other people. I meet some great people that I still to this day keep in touch with. Great company Supervisor not helpful Elementary school mentality Places is a job I did my job supervisor would come down on me for no reason was their almost 10 years treated me like I was a rookie every day I stepped for in the door don’t waste your time if wanna be disrespected every day plain and simple. Weekends off No life don’t care about you or your family Great company with bad management at least the one in P.R. besides that everything else was good. One of the greatest companies I've worked with providing advanced tools to make your job more efficient but at the same time one of the most difficult to work as a team Pay Union Good place to start a career in pharmaceuticals Leadership operates in a vacuum; all well unless there is a complaint, concerns go unanswered, or worse, cause retaliation, HR not helpful. Their ‘core values’ are a word salad; I don’t know how senior leaders can look at themselves in the mirror. A lot of hypocrisy. Get the pharm experience and leave; if you have at least a bachelors you can get in with a Pharma company, if that’s your goal. No support from managers No support from managers if you have an issue. Manage by email. At best speak to your manager once a month for a 15 minute review. Training is non existent after the initial onboarding training. QA is a mystery to reps. They don’t train on it, how they grade is not shared with reps, they don’t do enough QA grades to accurately represent how you are doing, M-F 8-5pm, no weekends, OT on occasion. See review Great career There are many teams to work on, so I am only speaking specifically about my team. I work with the Rytary medication & my team is wonderful. Management is the best I’ve ever had & the job is not hard to do at all. Supervisors and treatment Manual pick supervisors are the worst, not only do they love giving away 300 dollars worth of true blues to the bare minimum workers but they will demand every department stays overtime instead of getting on the floor and doing lines to ensure no late trucks, they are rude and entitled, feared by employees so no one is willing to speak up about the things that are done to them in fear of retaliation. Working supervisors?? More like lazy supervisors. Good benefits Pay isn’t the best, no life, toxic environment. Clean restrooms. Not even given a chance. Mngr in the picking the department was very rude. Let go for no legitimate reason on 1st day of order picking Favoritism at its finest. I was told if you have questions to speak up. Don't do it. You will be disliked and let go. Horrible culture only concern was acquiring other companies The company does not invest in talent...especially diverse talent! There are virtually no programs for succession planning, growth opportunities or to have mentoring. Great salary and bonus Too focused on acquiring other business and not on the employee"
Amazon.com Services LLC|" Good pay, terrible management Management is terrible - no oversight at all. Pay is fantastic for very easy work. Never met my manager once. Couldn't resign properly because he also wouldn't answer my emails. 3 It's exactly what you expect from a retail job. Pay is all right, and management treats you well usually. Management is usually really nice. Store is pretty small as it is meant to be a hybrid ""walk-in"" type of store. There are about 2 or 3 cashiers working the registers mostly. There are several assignments, some are very isolating, others are just dull. The most intense job is working the registers. If you're here to get a check, go for it. Sometimes they might ask you to help out other departments, you'll actually have to earn your money in that case. The produce department is the worst. Management is great, team is very welcoming, the overall culture is positive. Short breaks, Terrible break room with the same music that makes you go insane. Work place typical day when you scan in(clock in) you go to your dept leaders where they will randomly place you where help is needed they will routinely go around giving production numbers on your overall work production ratings if you are not scanning merchandise then they will get on you. My dept was Stowing, robot selves were ALWAYS full NEVER no room to fit merchandise in. if they ask you if you want to learn other depts be sure a raise will come in with the training you are receiving other depts were getting paid more for the job I was learning in. VTO was always a plus but only when it was available. You are just a number there to them. Its a good job to start off your resume. Benefits starting on day 1 Busy and fast paced helping time fly. Roles and job descriptions vary day to day. Majority of training is virtual computer based vs hands on.. Artificial intelligence plays more of a role than human communication Medical Benefits Lack of PPE Amazon flex Underpaid and overworked , they don’t even offer better pay during bad weather, also you half to wait at stores for hours, no extra pay, it sucks to work there Eh its okay. It's a job. Pay is good. Management is awful. You'll always be an expendable number. Don't try to advance. Not enough pay to justify the extra responsibility and risk. Good Repetitive work. No Interview Required. Occasional Raises. Stay on your feet whole shift. 30 Minute lunch break on 10 hr shift. 40 hours 4 days a week Fun environment to work with and meet mentors Enjoy the opportunity given to me by the company, went from a L1 Role to L4 within half a year and enjoy the teams I’ve worked with. Diverse culture engaging site and provides wonderful support for fulltime and part time associates Lunch It’s place to work but no fun there is lots of stress on work but you can make enough money to make money for average living expenses for single people They provide lunch when company exceed their productivity Short breaks but have good health insurance for those who want to pay productive its cool and laid back. Easy work. managment sucks . long hours. Its cool. Easy pay. Nice pay. Nice benefits. 3 days off four days working. overtime hours 3 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Being part of a large company. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Too many supervisors who are not all on the same page, making it confusing. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Fast paced. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Very busy, moving fast. 4 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Flexible schedule. You get to choose when you work. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? The very early start shift. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Go in, have a meeting and find out where you’re working. Go to your assigned working space. Depends on where you are but most of the spots are very fast paced and physical I love working at Amazon and here is why… The people… The training and opportunity to advance into other roles. Safety! “Today is just a start, tomorrow is what you make it” That statement is so true. I feel they really care about you as a person whether it’s being safe or having issues at home, they provide mental health if needed from day 1 along with many other benefits. You also switch up and get to do different jobs. There is not a hard job at this location. Our location is a sort center. Every age is welcome. 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? Medical, dental, and vision Benefits What is the most stressful part about working at the company? I was a PA and well Managers expect to much from you and every other associate, while they are behind a laptop just staring at you working and pointing out every bad thing but not congratulating when we beat records… What is the work environment and culture like at the company? It was very diverse and was really respectful with everyone’s culture What is a typical day like for you at the company? Very Busy from the start until the end very demanding pushed hard to make numbers Very busy on your feet for ten hours. No sitting is allowed even when you are entering data, even managers are not allowed to sit. To problem solve, train new hire and learned five different roles. Some people love working at Amazon and many hate it. Benefits managers are not there to help you they only worry about rate. 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? I was luck to be apart of the G&A team. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? There are so many tools to use it’s overwhelming in a good way. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? I was remote Physically exhausting Physically demanding Favoritism Great health benefits They pay around 5,000 for your school within 90 employment with them Long hours with only 2 30 minute break No job security Easy to use app that let's you see your time and attendance, pay information and your benefits ect. Good company Fast paced environment and information can be unorganized. Good culture surrounding learning and work life balance. Management is excited to train new employees, and leadership principles are key. Very unfair when discpline is brought up or when speaken too Very disrespectful people in management that love to treat people like they some useless piece of bag never trust them about anything alway lying.. fr Repetitive Good if you want to repeat the same things over and over everyday. However it got really tiring and feels unfulfilling. Usually, everyday I need to do at least two freezer runs. The jackets are stinky sometimes. Productive, provide fun events, and level-up opportunties This fulfillment center is a fast pace environment and gives opportunities for level-up and career changes. The insurance and all benefits are pretty good when you take advantage of them. The HR on-site is very helpful when you have questions. Good pay, terrible management Management is terrible - no oversight at all. Pay is fantastic for very easy work. Never met my manager once. Couldn't resign properly because he also wouldn't answer my emails. 3 Amazon.com Inc in a nutshell has gotten to big Like many other companies can get consistent hours workload is dependent on what type of warehouse you work in. Management is always good they fit people based on the area the warehouses are built in. Hardest part is the lack of knowing how much work will need to be done for the day usually never more than 180K max. Typical day at work usually consist of 70-80K packages at a small delivery station. Insurance Benefits, Higher Pay all around 1 Toxic Rate means more than you, all management are pervs and I’ve been to 3 facilities, overworked you if you’re good 30 miles a day but you make the same at your buddy standing in one place all day packing a box. There’s a few people that care that’s far in between but they have no power to help. 1 1 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? Gained new friends. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Working as hard and fast as you can, but told you're not moving fast enough. Managers standing around watching you work like wardens. 10-12. Hour shifts with 30 minute break. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Favoritism and cliques. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Every day is rushed. Productive fun work place. Amazon was a great place to work. It was one of my favorite jobs. They give you room to advance in the company and have great benefits! The only bad thing is the long hours. They have four days 10hrs shifts or three days 12hrs shifts. It can be a great company to work for as long as you do not have a family with small children, I enjoyed working at the Amazon fullfillment center in Seattle. Where I had my troubles in the beginning were not being allowed to sleep at home because of a bad relationship. But then when I got back on at the Amazon Fresh store the 10 hour days really started to get to me. All in all, it is a good company to work for if you're young too. Productive and Fun Place To Work I enjoy working here because time flies so quick that your almost going to lunch & than next thing you know your punching out! The labor is good for growth. Amazon is Amazon Good benefits. Bad is management. We definitely need more pay to work there. Fast Pace place. Not built for the weak. Every building is different. Good luck! Free holiday meals Short breaks Ok Under staffed, high expectations and fast paced. Time does go by fast, not always time for a break. If you work the overnight, you make more money. Decent pay and benefits for entry-level warehouse work Amazon is pretty efficient at hiring and training entry-level warehouse associates and offers decent pay and benefits on day one, especially if you start just before peak or prime days. The facility was clean and most people were friendly. It was pretty amazing to see how much product is warehoused, picked and shipped so quickly. Like really, it’s pretty cool. The problems are the same as any job, anywhere - people who don’t do their work and complain and bring their drama with them. Also, management who plays favorites. Good entry-level on-the-job training, clean facility, decent pay and benefits. Same as everywhere. Feels like I'm MTV punked. Very terrible management , they don't care if you get hurt working there. They don't want anything less then 110% unless you were the managers favorite Time off Everything else good place to work but... i worked for a year, its stressful ,employees make things worse. the culture is good. a lot of physical work, it also a place to make some friends. some people are very rude but others are nice and friendly. Disorganized its sucks. don't work there. the only good thing is that you get paid weekly. Management does not care about you. They want you to pick up the pace, but don't bother to actually help. I was a brand ambassador and got to work with other college students. I enjoyed my work. It was easy and meaningful and I was learning a lot for a college job. I planned events and posted on social media for them. I was exposed to new elements I had not worked with before. Great workplace Super fun I would love to go back but am on the bigger and more important things to do with my life and I love how easi training is my life and my life is not even doing a lot more than my overall good things to say good management, help is always available when needed, easy to advance if you put in the work, super easy to request days off if needed its all through the system Toxic culture The best way to describe Amazon culture is a meatgrinder that burns through management and associates alike. While pretending like nothing is the matter. Fast paced environment, various roles available Job security is there if you are willing to work hard and keep customer focus. Good time off options of paid or non paid time that was flexible. HR was always available for questions. Be prepared to do a lot of physical labor Working in the warehouse has a set routine. If you are excelling in particular section, you may be set into that position semi-permanently. If you are a good worker, leadership will call upon you to sometimes assist them in some of their duties. If you happen to be a poor worker, you may sometimes be put into a easier position. Which is unfair. Free lunches Physically demanding Honestly not as bad as people make it I hated working here at first, but after a while u get use to it and get close with your coworkers and honestly it becomes sort of a bearable work place No No no no if you want to stand all day and have back and hip problems by all means. This place is for single people or people with good child care. It’s tiresome Good pay, terrible management Management is terrible - no oversight at all. Pay is fantastic for very easy work. Never met my manager once. Couldn't resign properly because he also wouldn't answer my emails. 3 Meh I worked there as a seasonal employee. It wasn’t terrible but it’s the evil empire of Amazon. A lot of chaos but everyone one I worked with were decent hard working people. 1 Good Flexibility I enjoyed the flexibility of choosing my own schedule to a degree. Culture will depend on the on-site management but overall was pretty good. Great part time job or side gig. Not consistent rules from property to property. I felt isolated and singled out by management. Not a happy place to work. Pay is decent, benefits are really good. Hours can be difficult depending on which property you work at fullfillment or distribution. It has has beed the best job in my career Unfortunately I had to quit because I was planning leaving the US. The salary is excellent, the 4 day week shifts is excellent, to have 3 days off, I really miss that. Job safety is the highest, they really go by 'Safety First' The leadership is very good in terms of training the workers and very supportive . The management is very supportive. The leader is always checking on the employees to make sure that everyone understands their job role. I am really impressed with their smartness. 4 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Co-workers and pay rate. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Only having 2 - 30 minutes break for a 10.5 hour shift. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Everyone works together to get orders out to customers. What is a typical day like for you at the company? I work different areas everyday, there is typical day. The risks outweigh the benefits Safety regulations are often disregarded, in favor of maximizing output at as low of a cost as possible. Employees are rewarded for working fast, punished for not being able to keep up with increasing volume, and the turnover rate is huge due to the pay being so low for such a physically demanding job. Terrible Culture is terrible if you don't check woke culture boxes. Hours are long and management is inexperienced. You are just a number, and the only way to move up despite being labor tracked is to be friends with the right people. Decent pay Short breaks, favoritism, woke culture Good for extra cash Not for someone who need job stability or security. Okay if you need extra cash. The managers or team lead were not helpful. This warehouse felt like high school, very immature environment Coworkers Management, unorganized, no support Very boring work and not very fulfilling There was not a lot of work to be done at the facility I worked at so there was a lot of standing around and waiting for something to happen. It was nice at first but after weeks of just standing around it gets incredibly boring. Fun place to work. I have good experience working at Amazon. They have good benefits and the workplace culture is good. The management was always available to help employees with their needs. They were flexible with my schedule when I was finishing my studies at the Cisco Academy for my CCNA. I'm happy to be one of the IT Engineers of the MDW7 OpsTechIT. 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Great people great job great pay and benefits What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Time restraints What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Fast paced but fun What is a typical day like for you at the company? Variety of duties Love amazon Amazon is a place where you can be yourself . No one judges you. You are able to wear pretty much anything you want plus , they are very cultured. They accept everyone . I love the A to Z app, its amazing . Plus they have awesome benefits They only care about themselves Amazon is such a catfish company. They don’t train you they just throw you out there I worked at an Amazon go with the just walk out feature . Let me tell you , the store is so bad they canceled the other stores that were supposed to open shortly after . They extend it an extra year for them to open because the store was doing so poorly . The store has had empty shelves since grand opening 🤣 Tienen buen ambiente laboral Tienen un ambiente laboral muy ameno y son muy justos con la remuneración. Working in their warehouse is not good for your health. The actual work of this job is not difficult. The work environment is not optimal. The breaks are not long enough. If a work station is far from the bathroom there is a problem if you need a break. If you are injured at this job they will try everything to ensure they won't have to care for you. It as all about production and zero care for the workers as humans. Relax fun friendly Great environment friendly makes u feel wanted great understanding great work schedule paid weekly great benefits very understanding if u have children and need a schedule to work around Good job with great benefits but no work/life balance IMO Honestly the job is really easy and has a lot of great benefits and good pay, you can also advance with the company if that's what you are looking for. The only thing i didn't like after working 2 years is the Mandatory extra time calls, they were very frequent on my site so working 59 hrs a week for an entire peak season isn't healthy IMO but they also payed really well the overtime so if you are fine with having no life outside of work for a few weeks/months then the job is great. Good environment, Great pay and benefits, Growth inside the company, Good job overall. no work/life balance, frequent mandatory overtime good place to work I liked working there , but I needed more hours. I was a flex worker. management was really cool and understanding. they were easy going. there weren't any bathroom restrictions. 2 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Benefits and that’s about it What is the most stressful part about working at the company? You’re constantly under the watch of your management team What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Very sub par What is a typical day like for you at the company? Boring and you don’t feel human Good pay, terrible management Management is terrible - no oversight at all. Pay is fantastic for very easy work. Never met my manager once. Couldn't resign properly because he also wouldn't answer my emails. 3 Not a bad gig If you're a college student or something looking to pick up some extra hours a week, consider amazon. It's a solid gig. You choose your schedule at the beginning which means you are in full control. also, you can modify your schedule once you start, also there is a pretty lenient point system for callouts and tardies and the points are very easily replaceable. Also after working about 30 hours you'll begin to see some personal time to use or acrue which is basically paid time off as a seasonal/part-time employee. Actually considering going back for another holiday season 1 Easy mindless work The work is relatively easy, mindless, and fast-paced, but it gets boring and monotonous quickly. If you don't mind doing the same thing all day and every day, this is job is for you. They will hire just about anybody without a criminal record or failed drug test. The place is managed partly by their algorithms/software, so management/ HR just enforces company policy. It's a good place to learn to work in a warehouse environment. Productive and fun workplace Amazon was great place to work for. There are so many things that you can do through Amazon as it is such a huge company across the world. As a regular warehouse associate, you can travel with expenses paid through the company to help train the employees at a new location. You were given an number of vacation time, paid time off, and unpaid time off that you could either use or accrue throughout the year. The only hours you had to use by the end of the year were your paid time off hours. The other two rolled over to the following year. The only bad thing I really have to say about the company is the management. When I first started, I had a total of four managers that came and left the department in a season. Other than that, managers had their favorites and excused them for their actions. Free lunches over peak, drawings, giveaways, personal leave, time off(unpaid time off, paid time off, and vacation) healthcare and transportation to certain areas Poor management or just bad timing Amazon it Hard to get Computer In the Amazon company most by certain service groups always sought to tarnish the image at Amazon, and continue to lie about the good Amazonan workers. they hardly accept to solve the needs of others to build their future. I never received free lunch in Amazon 15mn free its a good place to start if its your first job or you are really in need of employment its a good place to start for your first job but I was working there for 2 years no raise and the management there sucked there always micromanaging you Fun Amazon has a lot of teams and good opportunities to grow Sometimes the oncall can get bad you can let your manager know. Sometimes performance evaluation is unclear Exhausting, you have to do others work. No bueno Just way too many stops per day, and if by a miracle you finish before the sun sets, you have to go help everyone who couldn't finish. Which is a lot because 70% of the staff are brand new since nobody wants to stay being overworked Nice work environment Nice managers nice coworker they have 4 day shift sun to wed and from wed until Saturday you goin to pick up the packages from 3 site supposed to not decrease the rate for the shift less that 60% Free coffee Great resources Career growth Great place to grow your career and learn new skills . Easy to move to other orgs if you meet the bars. Some teams are easier to join and get promoted to higher levels They have terrible rules. They treat you like children. And the worl is really hard - no. Joke. Find another job. All task at amazon are extremely psychically tolling. They treat you like children. They will write you up and take your job over stepping on a cart. Or an ear bud. The money is okay. But not for the amount of work nor how much you're making the company in a single night. The worst job I'm forced to have in my life. Productive Easy work great atmosphere to work in rotating positions within company once you come back from your break get a lot of breaks during your work hours Pay Dont leave for break Hard work It was hard work once I started but after while I got used to the work things was explained to me as I took on different positions and before leaving I had applied for learning ambassador and left at that position. terrible just terrible... run. they would over work you even you exceed the daily goal rate you wll still get called out Flexible schedule Online shopping is stressful when we are micro managed. Constant walking on hard surfaces. Breaks aren’t long enough to rest your legs and feet. Pay is okay but we should be making at least $20 an hour. 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? It’s an easy job to get that’s about it . What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Everything, long hours, no staff support, under trained management, you are treated like another warm body. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Terrible , they don’t care about their employees at all. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Stressful, you have stressed out people above you taking everything out on you . It’s stressful on all levels . Great At-Home Job Great job both part & full-time from home. Works with schedules. Management was alright, I didn't feel valued or appreciated. Definitely recommend this position if you want something chill. workheavy wasnt bad, you have to stay on top of your duties Otherwise they will replace you very quickly. Hours are pretty long, but pay and benefits make up for it. 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? I learned about sort center operations and robotics. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Lack of support. Poor leadership in upper management with little to no warehouse experience. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Poor. HR literally watched cameras just to write associates up. No support for managers. Worked 65+ hours a week. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Minimum 12 hours. Very high stress level. Don't apply Amazon and management don't care about you. They only care about rates numbers and there bonuses. After 4 years they started treating me like i was nothing saying I don't work hard am a bad employee all that then set me up to be fired. I would avoid Amazon at all costs. Plus there pay and benefits are weak compared to others company's. None They will work you to death then toss you out the door when they are done. Cool Definitely was a cool and fast-paced environment to work in. Great pay and even gave pto. It was also great because you got benefits such as dental and other great things. Good pay, terrible management Management is terrible - no oversight at all. Pay is fantastic for very easy work. Never met my manager once. Couldn't resign properly because he also wouldn't answer my emails. 3 Very flexible work environment Amazon flex allows individuals to create their own schedules and complete work at their own discretion. All job responsibilities and instructions are located in the app. Hard, but doable Working in a warehouse already has it's problems. With Amazon, they try to be fair, but 10 hours, 4 days a week on your feet (with reaching, lifting, kneeling, basically full range movement) is hard on the body. Also, their break policies are a bit draconian. 1 Easy job. Easy job. Just be prepared to deal with irrate customers all day. Pay is not all that great for the things you deal with in a daily basis. It’s a paycheck. Dont apply Job sucks, management sucks, easy job, but if you are good at the easy job your at you keep doing it, unless youre a favorite and or a yes man, no growth guaranteed, favorites get everything. They will screw themselves to hold a spot they need filled till the favorite comes in Money Everything 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Pay and benefits What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Long hours What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Culture diversity really good environment everyone is team players Good Company Amazon has a lot of teams and good opportunities to grow Sometimes the oncall can get bad you can let your manager know. Sometimes performance evaluation is unclear Technical challenges oncall Flex but No advancement I've been at the company for 2 years and 8 months and there was no possible way of improvement and no possible way of getting a higher pay. HR and Managers seems to either do know answers to questions or just don't care because one tells you to talk to the other and it pretty much does back and forth. Online discount, Two 15's and 30 break No Advancement, No answers to simple questions, Barely open to suggestions. Usually easy It’s an okay place to work. I wouldn’t go above and beyond though, your work isn’t usually noticed. Managers are usually young and easy going. The PA’s think their managers. Don’t get me wrong, it’s not that bad, but I wouldn’t stay very long. Flexible shifts Short breaks Overworked and painfully boring They pay new hires more than regular workers. There’s a reason they’re running out of people to hire. They expect u to be back at exactly 15 minutes regardless of how far u have to walk to the break room. They don’t allow headphones and instead play awful music on speakers making the day worse Productive and fun workplace Good pay Weekly pay Bonuses And great people to work with Easy lifting Team work Flexible work schedule Work/ Life balance Raises Praised for good work Easy work Always room to grow. People are taking amazon for granted. Some want a raise just for being x-trained into a new path, but won’t apply to T3 roles or new building launches (the real way to get promoted) I started in January as a T1. Went to a new building launch as a T3 in June. Got that sweet $10k launch bonus and pay went up $3.10/hr. None of that would’ve happened if I declined cross training opportunities and/or took loads of VTO! It happens from being willing to cross train into other paths, which can lead to indirect role opportunities and helping with other projects. That is what gets your name and face out there. Start networking with your peers and leadership. Eventually they will become familiar with you enough to where you can easily get into an indirect role. That opens up huge opportunities to get to the T3 roles. Once you become a T3 you just need 2 years of Amazon work history to apply for most of the T4 roles inside Amazon. During that two years you should be utilizing the $5,250 Amazon gives you each year to further your education or get certifications in a field that interests you. Amazon isn’t a s*** company. You’re in their s***ty position. Take advantage of what is being offered and don’t feel left out to hang. Fun place to work at You can always look for work to do and learning new positions/skills. In a matter of being there 2 1/2 weeks I was automatically made into a Blue Badge (full time) and got to be certified as a Water Spider which made my job not only challenging but I loved going to work there everyday :) Discounts, great team to work with, able to work up to 59.5 hrs every week, communication and team huddles every day N/a 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Cool environment and you get rewarded for great work What is the most stressful part about working at the company? It's a fast paced facility 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? The employees What is the most stressful part about working at the company? The hours What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Diverse mix of people. Loved it What is a typical day like for you at the company? Busy busting out work Very little job security and no real managers You didn't have direct managers nor did you have anyone to report to other than yourself and a machine. You simply showed up, tapped in, worked till break, work again then out door. Simple job, good benefits The job itself is easy, just can get tedious within the 10 hour work day. I feel they are fairly generous with time off and you don't need approval to use your PTO or UPT. The only downside is overtime during the holiday season and prime. Nice people They work with u On if you need days off or need help they help you It’s very easy work I mean and you gotta wear the steel toe shoes and they kill your feet but everything would be OK Terrible If you want to be gaslight and manipulated on a daily basis while watching incompetent management do nothing except sit on their phones and laptops, it’s the perfect place for you. “flexible” hours only if they deem you disposable and not necessary to general functions, or else they’ll do anything they can to keep you in the building, including letting 10+ people go home right in front of you while saying they need you there. Good pay Lots of hard work but good pay ,be ready to stand on your feet for long periods of time.They are picky about employees meeting their packing goal and check on you constantly . better work environment needed the building is hot. the roof leaks when it rains. overcrowded. more harassment awareness needed. underpaid. short lunch with long hours. no phones or ear buds allowed"

RTI International|" 3 stars What is the best part of working at the company? The hourly wage and travel What is the most stressful part about working at the company? The onboarding and eQip background check processing. Very time consuming What is a typical day like for you at the company? Slow at present Great work culture This is one of the best companies I have worked for. Management truly cares about your success and will always be willing to support you in your work. I enjoyed surveying patients, traveling to a variety of medical clinics. The pay was good and car mileage was compensated. Great company culture, Car mileage reimbursement, Travel experience Temporary job fun work place Since i joined in the year 2017 April the organization helped me with my carrier development as an individual that is the support, inspiration, encouragement and team work to deliver the mission, objective, Maintaining higher standards of ethical behavior and professional integrity to the client. 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Visiting different areas, the scenery, meeting many different people, and the pay isn't bad either! What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Having prospective respondents think you - the government - or hackers are trying to steal or get their information. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Friendly meetings, many different regions of people make it interesting. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Visit chosen addresses, meet and greet people who can help solve our purpose. Well-compensated part-time temporary job that permitted a flexible schedule -1 weekly supervisor meeting -no calls during non-work hours -trusts employees' abilities to perform their jobs -well compensated -set your own schedule -expenses covered -interviewees well compensated compensation short-lived research projects meant part-time, temporary work Felt very included and part of a team. Loved working for Rti. The pay was fair as was management. If there was a negative it would be that management too was already picked there was no room for advancement. Great for those who enjoy interacting with people I love my job. I meet many people from all parts of the world. I am not selling anything other than trying to convince someone to do a survey and having the right attitude and right personality, you’ll do great at this job. Good pay and Independent work for the most part. A job A job to pay the bills. Similar to cold calling. They punish you even for trying/ working hard if your numbers arent in line. Not the worst job Ive ever had. Great place Learned a lot as an intern here. Lots of experienced professionals in the field of global health that I learned from. Dynamic environment and lots of different projects. Wouldn’t recommend Working on M.E.P.S was the worst. They only care about numbers, being that you have to contact hospitals and doctors offices that have been most effected by COVID, they don’t care about the challenges. The job depends on you being able to get others to comply and on that project the basically want you to force and harass people. Honestly a Great Place I feel lucky to work at RTI everyday. Amazing benefits and flexibility. The mission is so inspiring. My coworkers are outstanding. I would tell anyone to work here. Flexible, always learning A typical day as a Field Researcher was getting paperwork ready, making sure all of the materials I needed were ready and in good condition. Making phone calls, interviewing in the field, talking to the community liaison and supervisor. Also sending reports daily via computer. They supply the laptop and all of the materials needed. Clients are sometimes difficult as you are in their home for at least 3 hours and there are small children involved. Definitely be positive and have a smile. Be sure to print out maps as sometimes you may be driving in very rural areas. You also may be visiting people in less safe areas so use common sense and do go after dark to certain places. This job is flexible but their will be evening and weekend hours as expected when interviewing families on their schedule. Be sure to be very knowledgeable and passionate about the study you are involved in. Be sure to be very organized or the paperwork can be catch up to you. This is a position for those that are self-reliant, reliable, organized and love to meet new people. The study is done verbatim in the family's homes and they do have scripts to follow and very thorough training. They do a background check. Sadly, I had to quit due to not taking the COVID19 vaccination. Hidden Gem RTI is a great company doing great work. I have been able to grow in my role and have support from management. This is a company where people stay for a long and stable career. Nothing but good things to say. I only left my role because I did not want to telework. Great atmosphere Variety of projects to keep you busy and interested. Very tenured professionals that are there as well as newer professionals, great learning experience. Thorough So far every aspect of my experience has been positive interview process screening process getting materials equipment communication about training. Very professional Very Flexible Working for the greater good of humankind. Work that really matters and is to help improve the human condition. Assisting with a government agency's quality control. The ROC is not the place to be If you're used to micromanaging supervisors and policies, this place is for you. If you value your worth, you'll avoid working for HRD - the contract company that bulk hires unqualified people. Not a place for a Phd with an academic career RTI feels that your success is 100% their success. If you bring in a client, you will have to give that work away to someone else. There is a lot of backstabbing. If someone has a problem with you, then they are really encouraged to complain to their boss, who will then complain to your boss, and then you will hear it 3rd hand from your manager and your VP. There is no incentive to be honest or direct. Not a good company Low miles pay. 3,000 miles you'll see 1200 to 1600 bucks only. Good maintenance but poor settlements. Company drivers make as much if not more than lease purchase driver Smart people, interesting work, great benefits RTI is a different place than you may be used to. As a contract service organization, we bid on research contracts from various federal, state and private entities. This has a downside: When you work on projects, you have to bill your time to the project; this means you have to track your time well and not work too much on a project. On the upside, it means a great variety of work and topics that you'll work on. Not everyone makes it at RTI. You have to be very good at time management and multitasking. If you are not, you will not succeed. But if you can make it at RTI, you'll be rewarded with working with smart people, interesting work, and great benefits. Getting to work independently It's a great part time job for retirees. But all the night time driving to and from locations and having to always work evenings and weekends wasn't ideal. 3 stars What is the best part of working at the company? The hourly wage and travel What is the most stressful part about working at the company? The onboarding and eQip background check processing. Very time consuming What is a typical day like for you at the company? Slow at present Data Collection brings flexibility Your experience will depend on the project and your supervisor. If you like flexibility with your schedule, freedom to work more when able, meeting people and not sitting at a desk then this is a good fit. Organized and Professional The people are great! They were very organized and professional during training and the time I worked there. I thought they were top notch in EVERYTHING! LOVED WORKING THERE! 4 Great pay great supervisors I'm on my 3rd project in a year with RTI, my first I traveled and loved it was reimbursed for everything and paid well felt like I was my own boss, now I work from home and my hours have been cut because each project is different but I love the supervisors and flexibility of the job. Downside ..projects end and there's no guarantee of work available. Part time work with Full time expectation's Pay is decent. Paid holidays and travel time. Paid vacation time for employees after one year employment. Too much down time. Expect you to work every weekend and some holidays. Micromanagement to the max. Interesting Job but disorganized I enjoy the variety of projects that we can work on as well as learning different social issues as well. However, management fails to assist with progression in the company as well as assistance with work performance. On some occasions, the people in the positions maybe qualified but dont know how to actually run the position. Full time devotion to a part time job Constant mico managing. A job requires going door to door asking people if they want to do interviews. Highly stressful. Never know who will answer door. Outdated means of data gathering especially after covid. Often dealing with local law enforcement called by people in neighborhood. RTI expects field interviewers to drop everything and work first 5 to 6 weeks of a quarter. When work in you area is done, there's no work until next quarter. Care little about workers. Enjoyable place to work where everyone is valued This a great place to work. You are given support when needed but there is overbearing presence or micro management. The team is dedicated to seeing everyone succeed Very interesting work So encouraging and helpful. I love the culture and environment. The training is empowering, the work was difficult during pandemic. Overall would have been enriching without that. Lots of opportunities Lots of opportunities for work. Your supervisors are invested in your growth. The company seems to want to make positive change in the world at large. Opportunities for international work. Opportunities abound Great for someone wanting to get feet wet in the world of contract research. But once they hire you you are pigenholed and it is very hard to move out of your role. it's a paying job repetitive research Great place to work RTI does a lot to have an employee first mentality and cares about its mission. Lots of interesting work, learning is always a part of the day-to-day experience, and decent benefits. Management that treats you with kindness and respect Pay is not always competitive Easy no touch freight job Overall a good compamy things were going good until my pay was cut which now has me looking for new employment. The job it self is easy but now i feel underpayed Proposals team lacks solid management RTI has built a strong proposal department because of the staff talent. However, the department lacks true leadership and the VP and Directors are focused on themselves and not on the development of their staff. Work gets piled on staff without regard of workload and feedback is accepted from only select members of the team. The team is continuously restructured and staff is forced to adopt practices that increase both workload and the time it takes to complete work. When staff raise concerns, management does not value the voices of the people who are speaking up and they take the criticism as a personal attack. The Director-level managers and up lack the skills and training on how to effectively manage their staff. The proposal team is great, but I am actively looking to leave the company due to my managers. It's the case of me wanting to leave my manager and not my team. The company mission Bad management Interesting work, good mission RTI does a lot of interesting work, and it's easy to see the difference it makes in the world. However, they pile on work at a totally unreasonable rate and salaries aren't competitive anymore. The culture is good and they are looking actively at trying to become a more diverse staff. Their heart is in the right place but it's fairly disorganized (constant ""restructuring"") and they don't seem to want to keep people by alleviating the workload or paying market value. Culture, mission, people Workload, salaries, disorganized and siloed Good place for mentorship. Good work environment. Welcoming people. They have a good work environment. It is very fair and equitable. Your manager will help you succeed and listen well. The pay is a little under market for my understanding of the market, but it is equitable and the pay raises are well structured. This is science-based research institute that cares about its workers and improving the human condition and the world. The mission of the company is to improve the human condition by turning knowledge into practice. They use science-based solutions to address critical problems. And this is a company that follows its mission in its projects and contracts and the way it runs the business. There is a real attempt at transparency for an institute this large, and a very strong commitment to equity, diversity, inclusion, and belonging that encompasses trainings and classes, employee resource groups, individual development goals and their approach to their work. I am surrounded by very intelligent, creative, thoughtful and committed coworkers who add value to every day. I feel so lucky and proud to work here. great coworkers, good support for remote work, flexible hours, interesting projects that matter, technical challenges, concern and support for employee well being can't think of any, the pandemic does create challenges, but RTI does its best to help us connect anyway. Overall an okay company. Don’t expect management to help you unless the project is high-priority. Work-life balance is nice. Pay is alright. Overall the job experience is fine. The company’s mission is noble and well-respected. As far as the job is concerned, there’s a wide range of variability, and management is often not clear on how they feel about your daily performance. I’ve enjoyed the high priority assignments and wish there were more of them available. Some days are fast, and some are awfully slow. Work-life balance is very important here and I think that is a great thing. However, expect to be chosen to do the mundane tasks for awhile as a new hire. Everything is “charged” per task and the long-term phD employees are advised to not “charge” their time to lower tasks; Thus, they will be given to you. Finally, there are occasional hiccups in task information due to a great deal of employees who work remotely and are not on-site. Good place to work, timesheets suck They care about their employees. The projects are thought-provoking. Good benefits. 4 week PTO. They seem to want people back in the office, even though people don’t want to go back. There are a lot of activities that get siloed when they have to go through so many people with different expertise. Timesheets and charge codes are annoying and prevent productivity. If I want to use 15 mins to go for a walk why do I need to make up for it since this isn’t “billable” when I am working on billable work for the rest of the day? Timesheets have to be done daily and submitted on a weekly basis for your manager to review. Great for those looking for pt work Offer great training and plenty of projects have a lot of people that are readily available to assist you when you need help or are having technical issues Easy job with incredible amount of flexibility and autonomy Working as a field interviewer has arguably been the most laid back, flexible position I’ve ever had. Set your own schedule, travel if you want (if available), minimal supervision. Good pay for relatively easy work. Helps if you’re outgoing and value independence. Set schedule, federal per diem rates for travel, paid mileage, excellent training Fluid hours 3 stars What is the best part of working at the company? The hourly wage and travel What is the most stressful part about working at the company? The onboarding and eQip background check processing. Very time consuming What is a typical day like for you at the company? Slow at present Covid Has really made it impossible to earn a decent wage. Work hrs have dwindled to 0 during Covid surges. Must be organized and a self starter. Must report data collected daily. Supervisors are very responsive. You get to set your own hours. At least 4 times a year work flow comes to a screeching halt and Covid has only made this worse. Paid travel time and miles. Ability to set your own schedule. Not a reliable source of income as work can be pulled from your case load for no reason at times. 2 Great place to work for There are so many wonderful things about working for the company. My favorite is probably the flexibility I have with my hours. I also love the company culture and enjoy working with everyone. A lot of employees love their jobs because it looks great on a resume and allows them to gain a lot of knowledge. Great for retired or SAHM's. Interesting & rewarding job. Honesty & integrity are a must. Diversity is big within the company. You meet many people during the course of your day. Your supervisors will work with you to ensure you succeed. Awesome place. Highly recommend. flexible schedule, you make your own schedule, awesome supervisors, ability to travel, you can transfer to another state, Permanent part-time but can work full-time hours, Paid mileage and time driving to and from your segment, Ongoing government study since 1973 weekends are required, possible language barriers, using your own car (they do pay mileage), people are distrusting of the government right now, some people think you're a scammer OK place to work For a non profit, there is an exceptional amount of emphasis put on growing the business without taking into account the stress it places on the workforce. Precision - Field Lister in NM Remote work with some guidance from a Field supervisor. You have to pass 4 tests before you are hired w/a background check. You have to learn all the rules of listing which are A LOT. You have to be VERY precise with all the paperwork or you will be let go. The company handbook has a credo but I didn't see any evidence of the way you are supposed to treat people from their HR department (very rude). My FS was nice but not a good communicator. I was in contact with other FS's and they seemed very nice too and better at keeping in touch. The company has very strict timelines for the hours you are allowed to spend on one map set. You get fussed at if you take any more time to do a very thorough job. The Field Listers are at the bottom of the food chain. Dispensable. The time sheets are very easy to fill out online and the remote work., Reimburst per mile driven over regular wadges. The Field Listers are at the bottom of the food chain. Dispensable. Great time as an intern here! Management was great and supervisors were super flexible and cordial. I could see my self applying here as a full time employee in the future Data Collector Interviewer I worked at RTI international as a Data Collector Interviewer the job was pretty easy. Once you learn the system you are good to go. They do provide a good training. My only problem with this job is that you are going to be on the phone all day and you might talk to only two people during the day just becausethe interviews are voluntary. there is a lot of micromanagement. Do Not Waste Your Time RTI is by far the worst place I have worked. This company does everything in their power not to pay you, accommodate you or anything in between. All they care about is numbers. They don’t care how you get them just do it, But don’t you dare mess up while doing it because you will never hear the end of it. They also don’t pay you for equipment issues. If your equipment isn’t working properly you will have to switch it out until something finally works, but you won’t get paid for doing so. For what they pay NONE of this is worth it. WORST EXPERIENCE WITH A JOB EVER!!! They don’t communicate with each other so you will be repeating yourself day in and day out and then because you have to repeat yourself so many times they will twist your words and try to make you at fault. No job security. No support. They don’t want you to grow with the company. Just don’t waste your time. None Pay, Management, Company policies workplace culture is good I worked for RTI for 2 years. RTI is a tier 1 company supplying automotive parts to several automotive companies. RTI is a good employer for people who like to work in an environmentally controlled atmosphere. Employees must be able to stand for entire shifts to complete their assignments. There are many opportunities to work overtime if a person chooses. Located in Rainsville, Alabama It's peaceful they are very understanding . If you work your 40 hours you earn a bound box worth up to $250:00 dollars..tide gain laundry detergent soap body wash u name it..it's a very peaceful work place.. They feed you once a month No compliants Management & training Excellent management and training. Co-workers fun and helpful. Early on there were a few frustrating startup issues but we worked together to solve them. IT was always accessible I learned that having worked for RTI is an asset when I applied for other companies.. They are respected. Good to work with....would do it again if possible, perhaps in supervisory role. Sometimes exhausting but that goes with the job. Ability to set hours The work is easy. You receive a package containing a case file full of maps in a segment. The segment can be small or large. After mapping a route (follow extreme guidelines as to how travel it) you a lister will list all dwelling units. When done mail it back. It’s outside which is great! I do everything from my house. Little contact with the office but there is lot of support for any problems encountered. I live in a relatively rural area. So I don’t know if I would want to list in a more dangerous area like a city where people may question why your walking around their neighborhood. You paid for 100% of your time from paperwork to phone calls and all miles traveled. Good pay, weekly pay plus paid for the miles you drive, set your own schedule, good leadership Use of your own vehicle, Assignments are unpredictable and it’s temporary job Meaningful work openness to employee ideas for improvement The workplace culture is top notch. We are consistently rated as one of the best places to work so that's been confirmed over time. Management even at the most senior levels are open to ideas for improvement from employees. Pay and benefits are typically competitive but with such a large company and wide swathe of jobs and employees there can be vast differences from employee to employee. work life balance (mostly), benefits, 401k contributions, workplace culture pay could be better for certain positions, needs more diversity at higher levels of leadership Its was a great place to work Loved this job, fantastic coworkers and facility. Good pay and very clean facility. Unfortunately I along with several other people were laid off due to lack of orders Great employees Got laid off Overall great stepping stone Great company if wanting to learn be dieseil mechanic. However you opportunity to get certification gets capped. They only do few certifications. Don’t plan getting a review or raises. Multiple guys have worked they 3 years haven’t seen anything. But it’s great stepping stone for something better Flexible schedule and decent pay but worst place I have worked. It's government wastage filtered through corporate bureaucracy. This company has so many problems, all stemming from management, same as everywhere else. For many different reasons; laziness, side-hustling, incompetency, complacency, half the people don't do their job and the other half have to take up the slack. This and the horrible time accounting for every second of your day keeps everyone in a silo and stressed/protective of their projects. It is a complacency factory. The only people who end up staying are long-hauler pension seekers. No one else wants to truly be there. You know its a bad workplace when everyone is counting down the days until Friday. Disheartening mix of permanent residents, newbies, people eternally looking for an exit plan and a few believers. Everyday is an unnecessary new challenge exasperated by the monolithic approach to fixing problems (no one wants to make a decision just endless reports.) A lot of pushing work down the line, giving it to someone else. You won't be above mindless busywork. IT is shockingly bad and the bane of everyone's existence. The security and tech protocols are a joke that interfere with your work constantly. They care nothing about productivity but endlessly harp on it. They force you develop skill goals and don't really care if you have time or not. They say it doesn't effect raises and it might not (there are a lot of opaque things here) but who knows. The good things are a very flexible work schedule, no screaming bosses, good pay and good benefits and that's why it's hard to leave, but I really should. very flexible work schedule, good pay and good benefits Everything else. older employees are valued; lots of variety in people & locations RTI International values older workers which I find refreshing. The field interviewer position pays well for part-time work. There is quite a bit of flexibility but it involves a lot of evening/weekend work. One sets her own weekly schedule (within limits) so it is not hard to take off for a family or social event. There is the option to travel and the per diem rate matches that of the federal government, which I consider very generous. It is a very good fit for an extrovert who doesn't like to sit still. At first, the constant knocking on new doors may be intimidating, but in time, it can become fun. commuting is paid, health & welfare benefit in lieu of health insurance, federal gov't rate of per diem for travel need to work in all kinds of weather, door-to-door work with some people being very rude, dog bites, cars getting stuck in snow Good pay/Job/Work balance I enjoy setting my own appointments for most studies and meeting people, around my personal schedule. Being able to choose and apply for the studies that I'm interested in working. Knowing that there's a beginning and an end date for each study, getting paid for Holidays even though the weekly hours are, on the average 20 to 25 hours a week. Working independently from home. Waiting for studies to become available in your area. Fun place Things where good they hadThings where good they have to go back and get what you need and how is it good to have a open source and what you want for Data Collections Specialist I was told at the beginning they would supply me with a laptop. My personal laptop was not equipped for the roll. It kept freezing during meetings and data collections. When I went to them about this multiple times they said it wouldn't be much longer. Out of the blue one day after work I get a phone call they ""let me go"" because my computer was equipped for the job and they no longer were going to supply laptops. The managers could care less about you. No weekends. Poor management 3 stars What is the best part of working at the company? The hourly wage and travel What is the most stressful part about working at the company? The onboarding and eQip background check processing. Very time consuming What is a typical day like for you at the company? Slow at present Clean, professional work environment A great place to work and learn skills. Great training. Always able to ask questions. Constant feedback from monitoring that actually helps. Helpful higher ups (even if they get cranky). Professional environment that still has a lively energy. The projects can be long or short term and are (usually) of interesting subject matter. You can learn skills to use to get into a better paying company. The pay is very low for those working anywhere outside of corporate positions. 1 1 Run! Don’t Do It! Run far away from this place. Horrible place to work. Supervisors set unrealistic goals. If you don’t hit your goals you get warnings that eventually leads to write up which will eventually lead to termination. Even though the position is a work from home position it still feels like someone is constantly breathing down your neck. Can’t even breath wrong on a call or someone is either calling or messaging you about what you did wrong. It’s something wrong every single day. Supervisors let their little positions go to their heads and they think they can talk to you any kind of way. Nothing Pay 5 1 Great experience I had never worked in research before and it was a great experience. I worked with a group of smart, fun, and dedicated people, learned so much from my colleagues and the study participants, it was a very supportive work place and meaningful work. Contract Ended Suddenly Contracts just end earlier than what they tell you and I didn’t appreciate that. The pay was ok and they didn’t micro manage you but the terms of how long you will be working needs to be clearer. Good Company RTI is a good company to work for. Work/life balance is great and they are very supportive of their employees. They are very involved in making all employees feel comfortable no matter race, gender or religion. on campus cafeteria, 401k match Decent but demanding work Work/life balance is talked about but never truly supported. Top level management messaging is not exemplified on the team level. The research itself can be interesting and rewarding but stress runs high and HR isn't much help. interesting work long hours, lots of pressure/demands This is a horrible fear based workplace with absolutely no job security and zip benefits. Employees are treated like trash. Terrible company. Horrible work culture. Management presents a professional front but have no real management or business skills. No job security. Upper management supports an inept antiquated business structure. Can’t think of any Too many cons. Horrible management, no support, terrible work culture, no job security, No benefits. It’s alright so far Decent place to work with thorough training. Make sure to pay attention during training or you will not make it through. Pretty easy and according to managers, easy opportunity for advancement. Remote work for right now short breaks Very flexible and high hourly wage. Projects come and go so the work isn't very stable unless you work on an ongoing project. Nice job if you are comfortable working from a home office and interacting with people who aren't necessarily interested in taking part in research projects. High hourly wages No benefits and contract work Great skill building and team like atmosphere I have learned new skills and the compensation is very nice. It’s interesting and you experience a lot of new perspectives. You work with different types of people from many different backgrounds which I found enjoyable and interesting. People, variety and pay It’s contracts so nothing is forever but there are always new projects. Like working for the goverment Political correctness is stressed over job performance , if you don't demand the best from those you supervising you'll fit right in., latest project had little to no guidance and if you take initiative on your own you'll be smacked upside of the head. Work from home? Crazy hours no guidance Not supportive I did not find it to be a supportive environment. Other people may have a different impression. As far as PTO, it’s 20 days for 10 years. Then you get another 5 days. Three Cigna plans are offered and start on day 1. I personally found the salary quite low for how complex the work was and how high the expectations were. Benefits start day 1 Not supportive. Low pay. Supportive management and good coworkers In the short period of my internship, - The RTI community is welcoming and caring - Knowledgeable and helpful mentors - Caring CEO With many products, some documentation and manual are not comprehensive. The technology has a high learning curve. Flexibility within certain constraints As a Field Interviewer with RTI International, I feel the work I do makes a positive difference. Hours are flexible as long as you can work weekends and evenings. I have been lucky to work with a great Field Supervisor, who cares about her team. Some at higher levels push to work after dark and/or in areas that are unsafe just to get numbers. The pay could be better, but at least it is a livable wage, if you're able to get enough hours. The end of each quarter might leave you with no work left to do unless you can travel to other areas. Overall, a great experience. No health benefits or paid sick leave. Annual paid vacation is based on actual work hours during the previous year. Not tied to a desk, not 9-5 No guarantee on amount of work/hours Lots of micromanaging If a call center environment is not something you’d want as a career you won’t be too happy there. There are lots of last minute switch ups and project changes so nothing is permanent. Lots of micromanaging and supervisors with smart mouths. There are lots of goals/Quotas to reach and job benefits take a little over a month to kick in. You may be laid off before you even get to use them :). It’s a job 2 15 minute breaks with a 30 min lunch. The work areas and goals of the company are admirable. I was a field interviewer and data collector. The work was easy to schedule and manage. My supervisors offered encouragement, good advice and were good listeners. At time, it was difficult to make contact with the clients who provided the input and interpersonal skills were helpful. The training was thorough and well-organized. flexible schedule overcoming barriers to participation from those selected Setyour uon schedule management was very helpful .Understood problems and advised you according on a daily basis. Manager would work with employees on a weekly basis to help you Flexible hours I liked my supervisor and team. The work fit my lifestyle. I believed in the job mission. It was easy to make a schedule that fit the company’s needs and my needs. It was a great experience I enjoyed the time that I worked at RTI. I met some really great people. I learned how important research is and how much work goes into a study. I would recommend this company to anyone. Pool management Work-life balance Work-life balance at RTI International is not a good place to work poor management and supervising. Try to micromanage you too much. They don't even know the job themselves. Pay & benefits My pay and benefits at RTI International are they had good benefits low pay Job security and advancement In terms of job security at RTI International, I think bad job security they will get rid of you very quickly. Management In general, managers at RTI International very bad management Culture Collaboration with my colleagues at RTI International is Good colleagues at RTI Overall My experience working at RTI International I had a good experience with RTI till they hired new management and supervisors sorry. None of them know what to do. And they try to micromanage you a lot 3 stars What is the best part of working at the company? The hourly wage and travel What is the most stressful part about working at the company? The onboarding and eQip background check processing. Very time consuming What is a typical day like for you at the company? Slow at present Great job for flexible people Enthusiastic and supportive supervisors. Personal risk entering neighborhoods, but if there's legitimate concern, supervisors are understanding. Days off aren't guaranteed on travel assignments which can be about 2 weeks. But the pay is great if you don't mind the hours/being flexible. The travel thrill, comfortable per diem for meals Days off not guaranteed 2 Call center help desk Great people. Great team. The job was only guaranteed 9 months out of the year and the pay was hard to support a family on but it was fair for what they were asking me to do. Lie to you about the job duties Work-life balance Work-life balance at RTI International is a mess Pay & benefits My pay and benefits at RTI International are low and no benefits unless you've been long enough to pull 1400 hours Job security and advancement In terms of job security at RTI International, I think is bad Management In general, managers at RTI International messy Culture Collaboration with my colleagues at RTI International is whatever Overall My experience working at RTI International uninspiring Great Place to Work I started working at RTI International about 3 years ago. I started working at RTI directly out of college, and was hired as a Programmer/Analyst. RTI International has played a major role in my success. They have supported my short and long term career interest since day 1. Fun Company - no benefits - unorganized at times Worked part time so no benefits. Really enjoyed the work there just isn't enough of it. Of course, COVID ended the project and all of us working on the project. Otherwise great people. Enjoyable Work Limited Work RTI provides you with the tools to succeed Go to randomly chosen respondents home to conduct initial screen and subsequent interview if selected. Respondents get a $30 gift for completing the interview. RTI gives you the training and tools to do the job well. They pay well per hour and for mileage. Hardest part of the job is when a respondent is rude and reports they never read the letter they were mailed. Some of the homes you go into aren't the cleanest or most comfortable. I've met a lot of great people at training and in the community when I conduct interviews. It's a great port time job. good pay, good training, lots of help available uncomfortable houses to conduct interviews Exciting place to work Lived working here. The employees and management are great. Was always a good atmosphere and good work area when there. Never had problems with any other worker around. Great pay but lack of job security Pay & benefits Great pay!! The only downfall is job security. A lot of the studies ofen are temporary and there are times where I do not have work for weeks or months at a time.It is a good second job or for a person who is retired Job security and advancement Not a lot of job security unless you can find a permanent study Supervisor was excellent I really appreciated the time spent at RTI. The culture in my department was fun and stress free. I heard the main campus in NC is amazing and so serine. Pto N/a Decent place to work They paid for training, but training only prepared you so much. The nature of the job was the hardest part- knocking on strangers doors, asking them to spend several hours doing a survey. Fast paced jobs Independent worker in my community asking questions from selected households about a current research on teen smoking. Training was a few days long and fast paced with lots of information and hands on learning by examples. Independence Lots of field work Data Collection Data Collection work is very redundant. Surveys are interesting but can be very long. Work can be taxing at time. Company pays decent but should have more incentives for promotions. Decent pay, great coworkers Redundant work, boring work life, no room for growth Great place to work I started at RTI right before COVID hit. They have done an excellent job at ensuring continuity of business and taking care of their employees during this difficult time. Great benefits, supportive culture ""Siloed"" organization. I often have no idea how different units operate. Stressful and Numbers Rated Benefits are ok if you get them, staff support is a no, only supportive of certain individuals and encourage them more. Some people are recognized for their efforts, and things are not always explained as clear and concise as they should be. Sone of the staff are helpful before you get a job performance notice, by helping you find your weak spot or the job may not be for you. Hours you work Constantly being called, feeling degraded, favouritism You are only worth the money you are bringing in RIGHT NOW. This organization is only concerned with its reputation, overpaying its bloated bureaucracy, and building super double platinum-plated LEED buildings. As long as you bring in money hand over fist for them, they love you. One hiccup in funding opportunities (do you remember sequestration?), and you are out on your ear. Used to be the nice 403b contribution, I understand it isn’t what it used to be You are disposable to them Management Absolutely NO support from upper management!! I have never worked for a company that lacks this poorly! So sad for anyone that chooses RTI as an employer. Good pay This job pays well but is very boring. If you don’t like to sit all day you will not like it . Also the management is very unorganized and no one you can directly talk to Good It was Small warehouse everything was easily accessible, good people, good work , although it was a bit tough at times , it was a very rewarding experience. Learned a lot Out of town Mission driven, smart people, tons of opportunity This is a quality organization that offers tremendous opportunity for making a difference in the world. They invest in the staff and the work culture, and the majority of employees work at an exceptionally high level of performance and commitment. The mission here is real, and people are passionate. The support the leadership is showing staff during the pandemic is unparalleled. Flexible schedules, benefits, growth opportunities, campus amenities Pace and volume of work can be intense. People who succeed here thrive in this environment, but not for the faint of heart. It has a 401K I currently work in Fulfillment/Data Entry, we are very busy during the summer because school is out and the Educational studies are coming in. During the Holidays it is slower which is good because you can take off and spend the time with your family."
Zotec Partners|" 3 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Remote work What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Managers babysit What is the work environment and culture like at the company? They claim to be family oriented but if your not in a supervisor/manager position your spoke to like a child and not trusting to be left alone to perform and do your job, have to use PTO for drs or kids appointments instead of flexing time What is a typical day like for you at the company? Stressful 4 Forest Fire Managment I enjoyed my time at Zotec, and would work there again if asked. That said, there are issues, but nothing radically different than many other companies. For example- Training is really great, but practical application in a safe demo teaching site using read only data would be fantastic to learn the book, then do simulation exercises. This costs money, however, I know. The other thing is there is a significant number of daily fire drills generally drive by clients. That said, we fixed client problems all day everyday, but rare to never did those issues ever make it a permanent fix, or process improvement status. As far as my managers? They were focused and professional while being client driven. All good things. I would work there again if able. Focused management Client driven firedrills, IT and Dev investments, Process team needs devs to implement permanent fixes Traumatic experiences This was not a good place to work. Stressful, underpaid, and work life balance is terrible! I have seen people CRY at there desk, many if times due to this job. There was favoritism and lack of respect! Work life balance, there isn’t one. There was no room to move up. When you bring problems to management, they could care less and pretend to care! You 0… ZERO PTO starting. And you only got 4hrs a paycheck. You got NO Vacation or Sick time. Just PTO 4hrs a paycheck!!! It was ridiculous if you got sick and needed to go to the Doctors, had an emergency! The pay is low and pathetic, it was only when people started quitting did they even attempt to increase pay, per a former colleague there told me. And they lowballed them. This was the worst jobs I have ever worked and was thrilled to leave! And anyone wanting to work then, please think twice. Management, Work life, Pay 4 Very stressful environment This is a very stressful call volume, you are not set up to be successful. You are micromanaged, you can not even go to the bathroom without it affecting you. You are not given enough time to take personal days, god forbid you have a health issue with you or your kids. They say they offer incentives but they are never on the check. The metrics a super unrealistic especially for taking over 100 calls a day. PLEASE RUN FROM THIS PLACE! The work and culture is great but their upper management and budget is not You'll learn a lot here, the tech is pretty solid. Work is fair and busy, with a great culture. Unfortunately, positives end there. Upper management is volatile and fickle, moving teams around, laying off in large numbers and treat engineering as a cost. I cannot recommend this company in its current state, look elsewhere Decent pay The pay was decent after 90 days but call volume is ridiculous during peak season. Metric based system that was very hard to maintain and confused quite a lot. No training They do not properly train you. 2 weeks of training (barely that) then you’re thrown to wolves basically. The pay is average. Great coworkers. Trainers were not helpful They dont care about the patients who call in about their bills. Training there is minimal. Getting patients to pay even when it shows they had insurance ٫ just not billed they still threaten or send them to collections. I had many elderly who paid 2x on their bill just so they wouldn't be sent to collections. Very very sad. They care more about getting money then helping the patients who had ins but just weren't billed than doing the right thing. I couldn't work for a company like that. Decent pay dont care about No training ride management This place will try to make you quit the day you start answering phones. They lie to you and say you will only take around 40 calls, but I have received well over 100 calls before. You are marked down on everything however no trading is provided so that you are able to improve next time. Remote, benefits Short lunch, management, training Pays well if you play the corporate game I worked for Zotec for 9 years, management never cares about you, only the work you can produce and produce quickly. No advancement opportunities unless you are part of the ""cool kids"" club. Lack of management There was so much bad things about this job. The customers were okay. I learned alot of great things and got experience. The pay is good. But it all goes down hill in management. They will not communicate with you, they never answer. And you get little help.ive been lied to way too much. Blamed for their own system issues. And my God, you are expected to take calls in 2 minutes with no after call aux at all. Everyone complained about multiple issues and no one listened. Be aware. We get help through zoom and most of the time they don't actually know the answers Pay, experience Short breaks, lack of leadership, no communication, turnover rate Productive place to work This place is great to work. Busy days Monday through Wednesday . Managers are great and the people who train are the best. Training could be a little more in depth Working Remote Right now we work remote . Team leads and managers are always available to answer questions. They have been voted top 10 places to work in Indiana for years now and they do deserve it . An okay place to work This isn’t a bad gig. Compensation is decent for the job. Insurance is pretty good. The CEO and other higher-ups are great people. However, PTO absolutely sucks so don’t work here if you ever want to take a vacation or are going to ever be sick. The company does not give any vacation or sick time, only PTO, and you only accrue like 4 hours per paycheck. My boss also did not allow anyone to use their PTO if it was not requested 48+ hours from the day you want to use it. This means if you wake up sick or have a sick kid one morning and need to call in, they won’t allow you to use our PTO to cover the time missed nor will they allow you to make up said time. They just give you an occurrence no matter what the circumstance is if it has been less than 48 hours when requesting to use that PTO. Productivity standards are way too high for their outdated software they make employees use, too. They expect you to get a ton of work done but literally half of your day is spent waiting on things to load so it just doesn’t even out fairly for anyone. Decent pay, good insurance, work from home Awful PTO policy, no vacation/sick pay, unreasonable productivity standards Not enough training, non-responsive management Program glitches and system crashes make it very difficult to assist patients, who often become frustrated with us. The training is laughable. Its literally on the job training. Supervisors are nearly impossible to reach when you have a question that needs answered while a patient is on the phone. There is no encouragement. Only negative feedback. Patients are understandably upset and take it out on you. Holiday bonus Short breaks, numbers driven, not customer driven, software program issues, bad management and supervision, only negative feedback. Avoid this job at all cost Worst job in the world, overboard rude callers, back to back non stop calls.. draining and exhausting. You will be burnt out by your first week if you even make it that long. Get Out! Overwhelming Zotec call volume is overwhelming, you only got 2 days of training and then you just cold transfer for everything else the calls are back to back you can hardly breathe the 2 day training class was the worst I seen ,there is no updates no tools on what to say to the patients they really need to reevaluate, there is no guidance and everyone seems to be to busy to support anyone its too much and their systems are horrible Decent pay, equipment provided Everything else Do not work here if you still want to sleep at night! This company is not being ran with compassion, understanding, or anything else the CEO brands the business as. Due to this level of not only unreasonable micromanagement, the job expectations are not attainable with provider optimal client service and still meet business needs. Taking 100 plus calls a day will have you in an environment of being lackluster and not caring if the issue is resolved which causes the client to call back and become irate. Please save yourself the drama and lack of sleep and work for a company with dignity and trust for people whom desperately need it. Pay is ok. Micromanaging, horrible work ethic, managers do not care about your life. Zotec Partners is the best I love Zotec Partners! This company truly cares about their employees and their families. I could not ask for better management or team. I have been with the company for 2 years and have lived everything about it. Management and leaders care for their employees None Don’t work here. They do not care about you or your life they gave me a very late shift I begged for an earlier shift for months with no response the calls never stops coming 100 plus calls a days they allow the callers to say any on earth to you even death threats and you cannot disconnect the call. This place is ridiculous. Nothing. Everything. Great Company Had to leave for family reasons, otherwise good company to work for. Manager was wonderful always listened to concerns. Training was top notch and reinforced at office if needed. Wonderful manager and coworkers, good compensation, good training Small office which is nice but not good if you are a private person 3 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Remote work What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Managers babysit What is the work environment and culture like at the company? They claim to be family oriented but if your not in a supervisor/manager position your spoke to like a child and not trusting to be left alone to perform and do your job, have to use PTO for drs or kids appointments instead of flexing time What is a typical day like for you at the company? Stressful 4 Mediocre Job It's the same thing day in day out, nothing too exciting. You at least know what to expect, but feel like you're not going anywhere. Not much room for growth in a particular department, but you can apply for other open positions. Great company and CEO Positive: The CEO is really a great person and very generous. Upper management is very good, always available and helpful. Decent bonus structure for some positions. HR very responsive to employees. Negative: Micromanagement and intense pressure on people working remotely with children during pandemic without support. Too many meetings and drawn out phone calls eating into productive time. Yearly holiday bonus, decent PTO micromanagement, more meetings and phone calls than are necessary, women paid less than male counterparts, treated unfairly if you have children 7 Great company A great place to work at. They really care about you. They provide plenty of training. Schedule is great and you don’t have to work weekends. Coworkers are nice and helpful. Great coworkers, ok company Coworkers were great. Management is a little disorganized. Benefits are on the lower side, not the best vacation time either. Need better cross functional collaboration. Awesome coworkers, flexible schedule Job was boring at times and minimal direction Poor management Work load was unrealistic. Overtime was expected. Pay was too low for the amount of work and stress you had to deal with. Lazy coworkers were overlooked while their work was divided up among workers already pulling a full load. Free lunches sometimes Understaffed, high stress job Not a good company, poor communication on management and the entire company I would never go back to that company. They do not communicate with the employees. If there is a problem it would take a long time to fix it. Any issues they do not investigate before they react to the issue. Work Monday through friday Everything, go to a different company Great coworkers The company culture is amazing but the company falls short on training opportunities in certain departments. Advancement and growth does not happen often enough. Management is terrible I worked here for 2 years. At first it was great and everyone was willing to help. Once through training though they leave you on your own and offer little to no help. There have been times when I would ask on something small from my manager (for example: fixing my time card because I missed a punch or accidentally added a punch) and they would not respond or help me fix my problem. When it came to IT errors (as a remote worker) they showed little to no sympathy when things were not in your control. The manager of my department set up weekly meetings so we can discuss where we stand each week. Every week they were cancelled except twice. The expectations from the manager were also very unclear. They would not tell you about production or what standards you were expected to meet. Compensation wasn't bad Management Best of 2020 and 2021 ... lol Apparently, the founder is great but the management under him listens to Lou Holtz speak, but does not handle their employees with the true meaning of his speeches. Quantity over quality. We do not give good customer service. We will even get written up if our ""numbers"" reflect otherwise. Worst job I ever had. Remote Everything Horrible, retaliatory environment Don't dare to bring issues of a non competent manager, they will retaliate against you, and get away with it. When I brought it up to higher management, they were shocked and actually concerned. Higher up managemt was nice, but lower management is horrible Great location. Nepotism, throughout company. It really just depends on where you land inside the company. Management always has management backs, regardless of what they say to your face. To believe or accept anything less, would be futile. It's Chess vs Checkers when it comes to White ppl. Remote position My manager was not willing to provide additional training after the formal 2 week training. It's all about being on calls and trying To get off phone in 3 min or less. The 90 day probation period is a joke. They say your stats don't count until after 90 days however your stats count as soon as you start taking calls. I made several suggestions to have the training revamped as it is not sufficient for the job at hand. You simply need more than 2 weeks. Remote work from home Mgmt not supportive after 2 weeks of training, Its sink or swim, They are more concerned with getting patient off the phone in 3 min or less, instead of actually helping the patient, The training needs to be longer, so that you are better prepared to take the calls. Very positive culture with a ceo that has so much compassion for his employees Zotec is a wonderful company to work and the culture the company strives to create is so positive and family environment. Scott our ceo is such a caring boss and I’m sure that’s why zotec has been voted best place to work in Indiana multiple times. Company takes care of employees Short lunches Unorganized company Poor management. No opportunity for advancement. Frequent layoffs. They value workers in other countries more than US worker which result in frequent layoffs of US workers. Wfh Management Unfair place You have to watch your every move. The Managment are unappreciative. If a patient ask for a supervisor and you transfer them because there accounts have never been handled you get a coaching. They don’t care about their employees or patients. to each it's own ● Work-life balance the job is great, their customers are nothing like the employer ● Overall this job is great but the ppl you have to deal with outside of this company makes my head throb. The job itself is great....i am not a therapist nor do I get their pay so.... Good Company!! I like Zotec and their work. I definitely enjoyed working at Zotec! Only drawback was when one of my supervisor tried to micromanage few times. I am fine with the lay-off recently. Good people don’t prefer to leave good companies but prefer to leave bad management. Good work ethic! Bad management. Management team is exceptional. I worked remotely so no dress code. I loved working for Zotec and had hoped to retire from there; however the Coronavirus struck and cutbacks were made. I was one of 53 people laid off. It was very difficult as I truly loved my job. Anyone interested in working there when they begin hiring again should look forward to a great experience and give them 100%. You'll get it back plus. Great Company! Work from home. Laid off. Steer clear This position has you doing nothing for AR. No follow up of any kind and you’re encouraged to write off everything. The management and directives are a joke. It’s a glorified data entry position and you’re asked to do things you’re not certified or knowledgeable enough about because other departments are lazy and under qualified for their positions. Terrible place to work. Don’t work here it’s awful! ! Don’t apply, just run! The training is the worst and you’ll lose any coding skills you have because all you do is move charges around. Very boring and management is awful! 3 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Remote work What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Managers babysit What is the work environment and culture like at the company? They claim to be family oriented but if your not in a supervisor/manager position your spoke to like a child and not trusting to be left alone to perform and do your job, have to use PTO for drs or kids appointments instead of flexing time What is a typical day like for you at the company? Stressful 4 Unfairness You have to watch your back while working here. The true workers do not get acknowledged for working. The ones that don't want to work often run to HR with every ache and pain that they receive from others on the team. 3 Patient centered A good company that recognizes reaching your goals and the value of employees with yearly recognition bonuses. Yearly reviews and training via seminars. 1 2 Beware of Upper Management Poor training. Unrealistic productivity expectations. Benefits are not that great. At the end of the day, you're just a number and replaceable. They will pile work on existing employees rather than hire additional help. Fast-paced environment It is a good place to work, My experience at Zotec Partners helped me grow as an individual and challenged me to reach my utmost potential in the position in which I thrived. medical billing This position was particularly difficult for myself, as it is not for others. You can get calls that may be difficult to not be emotional with, due to the patient or family members situation. But was a face paced and keep you on your toes work place. I love this place!! I wish everyone could work for a place like Zotec. The culture is amazing and supportive and promotes a family atmosphere. If you want to move up there is always opportunity and the company is always growing. I have never worked for a company that cares so much for it's people and community. I wake up excited and ready to tackle new challenges every day. The worst and most ghetto under paying job It’s funny how they advertise as a professional work environment. Lies! No training; sick or swim. The culture is ridiculous! People literally go to work in Pajamas. I swear! Ghetto and unprofessional. Way underpaid for the problems you constantly hear about. Accounts going into collections with no fault of the patient. Constant verbal abuse from patients and pay you pennies. I’ve never in my life have seen something like this! Don’t apply! N/a I'm currently employed with Zotec through a staffing company so cannot say too much. My manager is a very understanding and considerate person and she actually cares for her employees. This place does not care about employees You will drown in their work expectations for a call center they balance bill patients and treat employees poorly telling you your almost achieving your goals but just not there then you get written up Pfs My review is the company is okay, just some managers. The work from home is great. Three days out of the week. The location wasn't so great not on the bus line. Great place to work The people I worked with at Zotec became my second family I love and miss them all!! We had a very good time working together. We would always have pot lucks and bring food, if someone was down we would do everything we could to make them feel better. Birthday, and holidays were a blast here🖤 Not a good fit Zotec is all about making money. Company does not offer any incentives and very shady to the lower level employee. Zotec does not promote minorities to upper management Ok if you need work It's okay if you just need a job no chance for advancement I turn over. The information given is inconsistent between management. Busy every daym every call is a angry patient People High turnover no training Management is something to be worked upon Zotec is a wonderful company and they intice employee incentives but no further education on job training nor assistance in learning the job. Managers and Supervisors have not job descriptions and they won't give you the proper tools to learn. employee incentives and appreciation management I love my Job! I currently work for ZotecPartners it is going on 3 years in October. I love my job! the people here are nice and everyone gets along to get the job done! I have had 3 promotions since being employed here and I do not plan on stopping there. If you are hardworking,determined, and skillful person come to Zotec! They will be hiring over 300 plus people at the end of next year! Productive but micro managed High expectations and will ding your calls for the smallest mistakes overall a pretty decent place to work. Training does need to be more elaborate and professional. small office, great enviroment, helpful coworkers micro managing Terrible management. It’s a stressful work environment. You arrive at your shift and must be available on the phone and adhere to a schedule. Each shift is the same time daily, however, the break and lunch times may change on a day-to-day basis. You try and verify HIPAA info, obtain insurance to file a claim, or assist patient with further billing questions in less than 3 minutes. The training process is a joke. It’s more like you sink or swim. Don’t bother asking for any assistance after the 2 week training process is up. They advise they help build their employees, but there’s not many chances on getting far in the company for promotion unless you know the right person/people. Great Company I would go work there again. I don't want to type anything else but it's making me type 150 characters. Just work there if they pay what you want. It's a good place. Great place I love the people, the customers are always rude. The training process is rough, they expect you to know everything within 2 weeks especially since they don't do any hands on training, they just give you a paper and tell you what to do. The trainers are no where to be found when you need them the most. Prejudice Managers The managers are no cultural and they treat you like you in day care not at work. They are depts. that micro manage in a non micro managed environment. Refunds is the devil 3 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Remote work What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Managers babysit What is the work environment and culture like at the company? They claim to be family oriented but if your not in a supervisor/manager position your spoke to like a child and not trusting to be left alone to perform and do your job, have to use PTO for drs or kids appointments instead of flexing time What is a typical day like for you at the company? Stressful 4 Productive & Fun It is a very productive, but fun atmosphere. Answering phones & listening to patient's can some times be stressful. But the company sets up little games here & there to have a little competitive fun. 3 5 Low pay No advancements in this company and the pay is very low. I left the company because of its who you know and not what you know when it comes to moving up are around in this company.. Flexable Low Pay 2 1 Great company! I have almost 15 years under my belt with this company and I couldn’t imagine working anywhere else. We have the best software and applications that we are constantly improving. VP’s, directors and other management staff are the best! They encourage, teach, and develop you so you can grow with in the company and in your personal life. Managers learn a lot from their awesome employees too. Zotec Partners is the BEST RCM and we expect the best employees. To be honest the turn over and negative comments posted are likely from people that don’t have “it”. It is a fast paced, high volume business that you have to constantly be on your toes ready to change. That goes with the business. Employees that have “it” will see growth and development from their supervisors. We have excellent training despite what is posted. There are documents outling processes for just about every situation you will touch. Managers do one on ones frequently. You know the old saying...you can lead a horse to water but you can’t make them drink? That goes back to “it”. This is not a business for hand holding. We give you the tools needed but a lot is using common sense, reasonable and practical thinking. Work hard play hard! We are continually engaging our employees. Co-workers are great. Almost everyone gets along fabulously with each other and have out side relationships. True friendships are built and It really feels like family. If you have “it”, are able to roll with the punches, apply sound judgment with the tools provide and show up for work the Zotec is the place for YOU! Fun environment, growth opportunities- both personal and professional. None..I love my job! Good place to work Worked here for year and half after moving to Jersey from New York. Did follow-up AR and also did coding while in the AR position. Had to leave job due to lay off Review Summary Management was amazing, though all of the management staff that I knew, was laid off due to downsizing the company. This made a lot of people panic and look for employment elsewhere, like myself. Poor management Favoritisms is extreme in this company. ThIs company was a great starting point as a coder, but nothing went as what was set in my offer letter. Need better communication and programs to help new associates learn. Coworkers are friendly Demeaning to employees from management. Management speaks to employees as if they are in educated Don’t do it They are not flexible at all. Managers are rude and don’t speak to there staff. The managers do not know how to talk to a person with respect! Nothing is organized the productivity is unrealistic! They expect you do touch everything while they steady emailing you projects. You have to stay confide to your desk for the whole 7 hours. Your timed while going to the bathroom. Working there is like being in prison. Resources I am the third person in my role in the last 2.5 years. Management refuse to provide appropriate staffing resources. It is impossible to be effective. So I am looking for a new opportunity. Nice work environment Lack of resources never get time off management are baby sitters and phone rings off the hook with upset patients. more work less pay. unfriendly management. cant get time off because answering phones in more important. company trips customer service Terrible company. Do not work here This company is terrible. Promotions are given based on who you know here. Supervisors are being trained by employees because they have no knowledge. Favoritism is terrible here. There is no communication at all. Management has no idea what they are doing. None. All of it. Productive Always busy, learned a lot and enjoyed working with my coworkers. I was able to utilize my skills and knowledge. Growth in the company. Worked with different department. Zotec Constantly shifting priorities. No loyalty to employees. Minimal employee training. Must learn on your own. Workplace environment more for show than productivity. Stressful Management does not train well and is inexperienced in being management. Expected to meet several deadlines at once and want every project done at once. Inconsistent on job duties and how to perform them. If questions asked you are asked did you check your notes or weren't you in the training class? How to work accounts changes daily. Good company in general but management makes this company have a high turnover unfortunately. Decent pay Lack of training, unrealistic expectations, short staffed, inexperienced management Fun Place to work This was a fast paced office, lots to do, you could always find something to work on. Management was good for the most part, hardest thing was leaving, I enjoyed training my team and watching each one grow. Nothing appreciated It is like a factory. They overload you with deadlines and you are expected to meet all, sometimes, more than one at a time. There is no appreciation for your hard work and dedication. Productive Challenging job! If you like to stay busy all day this the job for you ! Know you will be on your phone all day. You are micro manage and the will write up for not meeting your monthly adherence. Ok incentetives Short lunch Great training and great sense of team motivation. I would definitely recommend this company, especially at an entry level position. I felt secure in the success of this company considering it's long standing success and opportunities available for growth. Comunication and sense of team effort Very large, therefore more competitive, but always opportunity for growth. great office environment very friendly and co workers very happy to assist each other with questions or support. Mgr. and Supervisor very easy to comprehend and very active on customer service floor. Fast paced Very fast paced, not family oriented. Turn over rate is very high. Lunches are to short considering the stress level some calls can be. The point system needs to be adjusted. ok place to work , it is a job. The company pay is pretty good. The training is awful, you basically train yourself. Lack of communication.Some managers are completely clue less. You are constantly refiling claims without actually addressing the problem to correct the claim. it's a job. you train yourself 3 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Remote work What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Managers babysit What is the work environment and culture like at the company? They claim to be family oriented but if your not in a supervisor/manager position your spoke to like a child and not trusting to be left alone to perform and do your job, have to use PTO for drs or kids appointments instead of flexing time What is a typical day like for you at the company? Stressful 4 good I don't have any complaints about my current job or any of the supervisors that I have worked under. They are very laid back and the work atmosphere is not stressful. 1 Flexible Hours and pleasant co workers A typical day includes working patient accounts and making sure that charges get billed out and any corrections that need made. I work with the Customer Service Reps, to make sure that the clients are happy and there charges are being billed out in a timely manner. I learned how to have better time management and organizational skills. The culture of the work place is very diverse. The hardest part of the job is making sure that all the clients that we work are within TAT. Flexible Hours Management and no opportunity for advancement 2 1 A good company,fair management and compen Busy and fast pace answering the phone all day and correcting errors on patients account. Reading eobs and making demographic and charge error corrections and resubmitting back to insurance as a corrected claim. I furthered my knowledge of medical billing and the management was okay. The work place was totally business nothing more and the hardest part of the job was the stress of the job. The most enjoyable thing about the job was the people I worked with they were great. Salary and benefits The non feeling of the company Idk There is alot of good things about this job. You just have to be mentally ready and balanced to handle this position. They will be stressful days and youll need to learn how to resolve it. The environment is fun and upbeat. Management is awesome. none i do not have a review to write my job is very unique we run an anesthesia group every day is different not really much i can say about this job as there are very different tasks daily I would not recommend working here. One of the Sales employees was a true sociopath (BEWARE). Management had no clue what their employees do. Communication between managers and employees is hardly existent. Laid 'a lot' of people off when they bought out MMP. planned activities when it was MMP Never felt valued or given opportunities. Raises were not up to par for the industry. Nice place to work, good hours and benefits. Just pay close attention to detail, must be able to handle irate customers. Must be able to multi task and take incoming calls back to back with not much time in between calls. Good benefits Coild be laid off without notice Change in management I wasn,t happy when I started. Not a fun job. They merged with another company. I left before they downsized, layed off a bunch of people. With the merge they changed every thing Nice people merged and changed Job security The overall atmosphere is wonderful, worked with great managers and staff, was actually laid-off which has been the practice for the last few years. My number was just called at this rotation. Medical Billing At first, working here was fun while it was still Emphysis Medical Management. They had cookouts for us and made it fun. After they merged with Zotec Partners, things changed a lot. We were promised no one would lose their job once the merge took place, however a few short months after, several of us were laid off with a small severance package. I guess you could say I gained experience in the medical billing field and have grown a lot since working here. Manager I enjoy working for my manger she is great, the atmosphere is fast paced environment, you must be a quick learner and be able to teach yourself and train Schedule Upper management lack of knowledfe All about the bottome line - never about employees All they cared about was making the most money. They never cared about making employees happy. You were expected to know everything, and every question was answered with ""you should know that"". It's over! Everything Very relaxed environment. Ability to work from home or office. One has the ability to prioritize their work load. You had the option to work from home or the office. I've learned i can work independently and effectively. I had full access to management via e-mail or phone. The most difficult part of the job was at quarter end and at year end. I truly enjoyed solving all client Payroll Tax Issues, Benefits Issues & billing Issues. Ability to work at home or office. Due to the loss of clients and the acquisition, Zotec was forced to downsized. Working from home Check email everyday with much time spent researching questions and switching from account to account. The most frustrating part is findings the same errors over and over again yet they are not fixed even though I have provided a solution to the problems. Fun Loved manager and co workers....was a great environment to be in.... only left because they down sized.........I still have contact with the people I worked with as well as manager people down sized Zotec partners A normal work day collecting files and other important documents that also had to filled according to company rules and stands this company is so outgoing and sweet to there clerk and other department within the company everyone help and work together daily to get task done perfectly alot of temwork. Lunch break Short breaks maybe also medical billing This job is an ok job, I love my co workers and it would be better if my boss would actually assist us the accurate way. I am on the phone with medical billing. do not apply here RUN RUN RUN This is the worst place in the world to work please don't waste your time one of my co-worker's lost his son and was terminated while on approved leave. He got nothing from the company in his time of bereavement. Then he got a call stating he was being terminated. Another coworkers was fired due to no fault. Run do not come to this company Nothing Everything about the job Very unorganized place of employment Zotec partners is the worst call center I ever worked for. The training was not at all helpful. They do not send out bills to patients, however they send them text messages. They send patient accounts to collections without notifying the patient. The patients call in very irate. My days at Zotec partners were very stressful. Would not recommend Zotec to potential candidates Culture was not conducive to team work. CEO is very difficult to work for. Management does not listen to employees concerns. Customer service is lacking."
Gap Inc.| fun company Enjoyed my time with GAP as their customers are young and fun as well as the staff. Their clothes are awesome and employee discounts are outstanding. I enjoyed my time there Overall pretty good I enjoyed working here. I was a seasonal and remote employee. I loved the hours 6am to 2pm (PST). The major bummer was that they didn’t keep me on after being a seasonal employee. Hours, Pay, Supportive Managers Being seasonal Wouldn't recommend I really tried to be positive but the truth is working here stressed me all the way out. The managers were overbearing, and the hours are always either too long or not enough (one shift I would be clocking a 9-hour shift, and the next shifts after that would be like 4 hours). The thing that sucked was I actually liked the position I was in, however it was mentally draining with those people. fun workplace a day a work would consist of being on register,in fitting rooms.learned to try and get people to sign up for rewards memberships. the managers were great and it’s a great environment to work in 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? Nothing it’s the worst job out there What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Lack of communication and management each supervisor has his or her own procedures and policies What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Terrible everyone there is rude and nasty the bathrooms are nasty What is a typical day like for you at the company? Long you only get 2 20 min break for working a ten hour day Good money no life balance It’s ok for single people not for ones with a family. Job takes all your time. The money is good and there is plenty of overtime to go around. It’s ok meh its alright if its mainly just do your job but the breaks definitely need adjustments 10 hours max need a hour break management is okay working environment needs work I find myself having to purchase my own scanner holder for the zebra because my location doesn't provide it for pickers good pay short breaks Store is pretty awful There are two leaders at this store who are absolutely awful people. They make working here horrible and higher ups just don’t get rid of them when they know they are the problem. DO NOT WORK THERE. 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? There is none. It’s just a job. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Their high expectation for employees What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Unsafe. Expect to do more work for less pay What is a typical day like for you at the company? Just work work work Ok place to work They took their time to convert employees from seasonal to part time/full time. Job itself was not stressful but certain supervisors were awful. I did get 40+ hours most weeks as a part timer. Nice Coworkers and Management nice people to work with and good management but sometimes overwork employees when it comes to shipment and customers can be a drag when they ruin clothes 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Employee's are appreciated! Goals to meet, rewards, something new every day What is the most stressful part about working at the company? BLACK FRIDAY What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Super family oriented and supportive with life changes. Avoid gossiping employees and you will have a great experience What is a typical day like for you at the company? Every day is different! Every day you are given a goal. You are pushed to interact with customers and sell, sell, sell! Great benefits It’s a decent place to work. Everyone is super nice, people actually work. We can wear our headphones which makes work fun & productive. Only down side is always VTO Good place to work Gap Inc. allows you to have one earbud in and listening to music or whatever you want to listen to phone must stay in your pocket while on the floor. The trainers are good at doing there job taking you around the warehouse showing you everything you need to know or want to know especially good at helping you learn more about the job you’ll be doing if your a hands on person this is a good because they will show you how to do it then let you do it for yourself if your not a hands on person they will stay with you until your comfortable and have it done. Break areas are spacious, A lot of clean restrooms, you can buy food in break rooms 2/30min breaks, can’t go out to your once clocked in Not bad for a first job Coworkers were very nice and welcoming in experience, and a typical day of work would go by just fine. The store doesn't get as busy (except on weekends and holidays) as others as this was at a mall, and they were flexible. Great place to start It’s an okay place to start out if you don’t have any job experience or if you’re still in high school. They’re willing to work with weird schedules, but there’s virtually no room to professionally grow. Nice people The Manger are nice and care but what you need as well also nice coworkers. They go based on your schedule and try to work around it , they are fair . Fast-paced retail store - Very flexible with hours but want weekend availability - Hit or miss managers - Certain managers will push cashiers to borderline force and customers to sign up for the brand card or loyalty program. 30%-50% Employee Discount, Can pick up shifts Short shifts, Not stable or consistent hours Bad company This job is so bad , the management is unprofessional and they don’t care about development. They give you 4 seconds in between to pick an item any passing time over 4 seconds adds up and they come tell you that you’re how manny minutes behind. You literally can’t use the bathroom or drink water . During breaks you can’t go to your car /or anywhere they don’t trust there employees. Bag checks going in and out the building. And there pick area is dirty and not safe so manny clothes that management sees but leaves on the ground . They have very low employees and they hire almost every week nobody comes back . 4/10 weekly pay Small paycheck, overworked Good benefits Good benefits, including the discount. Day to day work was always good. Obviously if you’ve worked retail you know how customers can be but overall a good place to work. It’s a job clock in clock out If you’re going to work here you can make great money. You just have to mind your business and stay on task ! Your able to listen to music and have paid breaks Fair pay Mandatory Overtime Work life balance fun company Enjoyed my time with GAP as their customers are young and fun as well as the staff. Their clothes are awesome and employee discounts are outstanding. I enjoyed my time there Overall decent. Enjoyed packing a lot last year, and started to learn picking before I had to quit due to my partner's work schedule and our childcare. I reapplied almost a year later and was rehired for a seasonal position again, but 4 days a week 10 hour shifts at $15. Last year as an entry level employee I made $3.50 more per hour than that. I tried to negotiate before proceeding with hiring process but was never contacted again. Super upsetting because I loved the work. Easy but fast paced work. Bad pay for 1st shift 1 Fast Paced Environment Very fast paced environment, can learn alot, but can get burnt out in the same spot since there doesn't seem to be any chances to move up from a call center position. benefits, pay is good fast paced, micromanagement, no room to move up Mandatory Overtime Should Be Illegal Overtime should never ever be mandatory. People have lives outside of work. Supervisors are snobby and think they are better than everyone and if you don’t for lack of a better word, bow down to them, you’re targeted. Nothing Overtime is mandatory Ever changing A job where you need to completely relearn the creative mindset that they hired you for in the first place. Not that hard to learn their preferences, but it changes often. Job can get frustrating, because it is a good company with too many blurred lines in branding. Be prepared to redo work often. Great place to work Job is easy. Great benefits. Opportunity to learn different areas as well. Also different times of the year there is plenty of over time that is available. Great place to work in school Great company to work part time. Lots of flexibility. Coworkers go above and beyond to help customers. Management could listen more to their employees. Discounts low pay Company is amazing, management needs work! I loved working for Gap Inc. what they stand for I agreed with. However the management team in my city micromanaged and played favorite a lot! They allowed certain people to create a hostile environment and would not do anything to improve or correct it. I was responsible for a lot of risk but my pay did not match the amount of risk and work I took on daily. This may be different for other departments by my specific management team is who I am referring to. draining, repetitive If you're a peoples, person you still probably wouldn't survive retail. I don't think anyone actually enjoys working retail. Gap upper west side had the worst management known to man. Unfriendly Work Environment, High Turnover Would work in the downstairs section which felt like a dungeon. Cold, No windows, would come in during the day and wouldn’t be able to come up til it was dark. Negative vibes. Dirty break room. Not worth it for the pay Great company I have worked and I can say that the experience was very great. I have always felt supported while I was there. The clients were treated as special guess. Pay was good They work you like a dog. This is a good job for those who don’t have a family. They give you lead way if your late. I believe you get about 26 times to be late. They call them an e day. Overall Experience The hardest part of the job is standing on your feet for 10+ hours and getting paid poorly for having it take a toll on your body.. A typical day at work was processing return clothing that customers send back to get there money back. I learned how to do putaway, picking, utility and Processing Returns was my main job function. They DON’T TEACH YOU OR TELL YOU EVERYTHING, YOU HAVE TO FIND OUT YOURSELF OR ASK SOMEONE YOU WORK WITH They say you get a $1 raise if you leave your department and work in a different one and that’s a complete lie cause I didn’t receive that at all. Cool job if you want to earn money with production easy money there. I liked that I got to work on my own and be by myself listen to music while doing work. Management/Supervisors there are not friendly. They have favorites there. I had an interview when I got the job not sure if they do it still but just be really aware of attendance there attendance policy there is not normal. Productive solid work Solid place overall. Must be able to stand long hours. Job does gets you in shape. Pay is also solid. A lot of walking and moving around. Solid place overall. Stressful and not worth it Rampant overworking, no communication, manage hadn't a clue about anything. People were great, management a mess. Big turnover too and burnout occurs often Good coworkers I worked here for 3 years, and I used to really like it but a lot has changed and not for the better, the training is little to nothing. When I trained in new areas it felt like a fend for yourself, I used to like working here until after covid. I took leave for 5 months after having a baby and came back, I was told I would get caught up on the all the changes, instead I was just thrown in with no help. Most of the time I did not feel supported. good hours the typical day was fast paced, stressful, production drivin, I stayed focused on my work and not the workplace drama, during the busy seasons we were overworked mandatory overtime working 2 weeks straight. I ended up injuring my wrist from strain and repetitive motions. Fun workplace, but Not Enough Meaningful Work The environment is very friendly and open, however I felt like the work I was given was not meaningful and was just busy work. I don't think they needed to hire a temporary contractor for the position. Horrible Just don't do it! They are horrible. You get PTO but they count it against you. And that's if they put your PTO in... took 3 weeks to get mine right... all about numbers. Don't have an emergency come up.. that will be held against you as well. Supervisors are horrible. Just don't do it. The turn over rate is ridiculous. Got to have thick skin to work here When I first started working at the gap call center it was crazy dealing with angry customer calls calling about their online orders. Staff is hypocritical. Supervisors and help desk staff tell you to adhere to policy then when dealing with a angry escalated customer they tell you to bend the rules only to end up having the call reviewed by quality assurance to give you a bad score afterwards. On top of that, help desk staff are very rude with new agents that they harass them. Some supervisors are very selective and have favoritism amongst agents. You got to have thick skin in order to work here if you want to handle customer phone calls. I'm at home and left alone to work. There isn't much recognition and the systems are not updated frequently enough. Lack of communication with package carrier companies make it difficult to resolve some simple customer issues, giving poor customer experience I'm at home Asking me to be on phones when that is not my job fun company Enjoyed my time with GAP as their customers are young and fun as well as the staff. Their clothes are awesome and employee discounts are outstanding. I enjoyed my time there not my thing I applied for a visual merchandiser/L.O.D at this company and got hired as such. I was under the impression that I was going to be taking over the position that a different employee was doing (merchandising), but I was never trained or really did any visual merchandising the entire time I was employed. I was basically just a cashier. The environment overall was toxic, especially with management. I was barely treated with respect as a person and I was constantly left out of conversations that as a leader, I should know about. There was very little work life balance as we had 9 hour days. no more than one person can request a day off at a time if you want days off. This is a good job if you love selling credit cards to the customers and enjoy working alot. benefits, relaxed dress code, bonus if you sell a ton of credit cards culture, expectations, long hours Great people horrible management and growth The bad: Like most jobs if you aren’t close with Someone high up or literally kissing the feet as they walk YOU WILL NOT get the opportunity you deserve as a hard worker. Always understaffed and management does not care.tools needed to complete the job are never there /or broken and it’ll be your fault because the lack of upper management accountability isn’t exist. And only raise you will get is 8cents the max meanwhile new hires with less experience will get a pay bump due to the rate of pay economically meanwhile your barely catching up. As a AP agent your literally Security,Nurse, safety,transportation,first responders and more and the training isn't something consistent. The Good: the people you work with are super amazing and fun as long as your respectful and hardworking too. 1 Structured and supportive This company gave me the tools and resources I needed to grow. There’s so much to grasp but it’s worth it. If you want to advance this is the company that will help you achieve that goal. workplace The Gap gives felons a second chance at getting back on their feet. The starting pay could be higher. Dont like the 2 30,min breaks they have. The upper management could be alot better Set Hours Breaks A lot of room to grow and learn There are too many growing expectations. Although the culture in stores are usually good, there was constant looming thoughts of all of the goals that have to be met (which are unrealistic) At first this is exciting, but after a while it gets draining. Easy but boring Easy but boring and long days. A lot of vto most of the time. Thanksgiving they make you work a week and a half non stop mandatory for 11 hours a day. Decent place to work Decent pay, not bad. Hours can be long if there and overtime is required. Overall a good place to work if you don’t have a family, otherwise look elsewhere good people good managers, flexible hours, poor pay job was pretty easy and expectations not too high. got as many or as little hours as I wanted, coworkers and managers were pretty nice. pay needs to be raised okay it’s okay get the job done. Not going to lie pretty good at my job good a driving brand loyalty and customer engagement. They have do have gift cards and little gifts for getting a certain amount of card and loyalty sign ups. Over time and No Communication Gap is not a great place to work. There is no communication from the top down and Over time is awful. Managers a re joke, dont have a clue what goes on in the warehouse, Ok pay, not enough hours, nice coworkers The most tolerable retail job I’ve had. Just inconsistent hours which is a struggle. I usually don’t get more than 10 hrs a week. That’s not at the fault of the managers at all, just one of the downsides. Some days are super quiet and some days are suuuuper busy. Managers are fairly understanding and communicate well and coworkers are nice too. It has its moments like most jobs but it’s a generally safe place. It is fun, for the most part. The customers are usually amazing, however, the push for credit cards and private information for loyalty accounts is too severe! Customers get aggravated and we get frustrated. I was one of the leaders, but it was never enough. Discounts at all Gap brands Credit Cards and Loyalty push is too much! Alright This place is alright. Has its pros and it's cons. I mean you get paid weekly so that's a plus. They definitely play alot of favoritism. Just stay to yourself and your good Gap is awesome I started at the Gap in the warehouse, I broke my leg and was able to transition to the customer service representative position. I really like the people in the company it's a great place to work Its A good job IF you can sell cards, if not it's super stressful and I want to cry. The people who work here are super nice. The discount for clothes is awesome too. They are super understanding for calling out and sometimes, work is actually fun. Toxic environment Gap used to be a good company to work for. However, now all they care about is saving pennies wherever they can and there is absolutely no concern for employees and zero work/life balance. Contact center managers are allowed to be rude and toxic and despite several supervisors reporting a manager to HR, nothing has been done. Great place Fun job and a ton of exciting people to talk to. Sure it’s fast paced but it’s never overwhelming. With a supportive team it was satisfying to reach our quota and hit the mark. Fun great place to work! The manager is so kind, accepting, and helpful ! Great place to work good energy and the work is balanced well. i loved working here ! Definitely recommend. discount ! not the best pay Easy job Easy warehouse job. Package clothes and throw them on a conveyor belt. Long hours and short breaks. The pay isn’t bad and they send you home if work is light. All downhill I’ve been working here 13 years and used to love it now I’m working here only because I’ve been here 13 years. Vargo system is too hard used to pick more pieces under red prairie in a nights work easier yet they say it’s more efficient. It’s hard going up and down flights of stairs all night sometimes for just 1 piece 1 tote on the older workers yet they will not keep you assigned to 1 floor unless you are a “FAVORITE” or have Drs excuse. I used to be a top picker and make grow (incentive checks) now I can barely hit production and am on the verge of getting fired. Benefits are great but pay is low and not competitive as promised. After 12 years of creating raises for myself they raised starting pay and basically I and everyone else makes the same. It’s a slap in the face as if my first 12 years meant nothing. I used to love coming to work now my attitude changes to depression as soon as I come through the doors especially when I’m barely hanging onto the job I once did so easily. fun company Enjoyed my time with GAP as their customers are young and fun as well as the staff. Their clothes are awesome and employee discounts are outstanding. I enjoyed my time there Productive place to work Great place to work nice home work balance flexible family like atmosphere friendly co worker understanding sups flexibility work schedule and days off happy place to be workef through pandemic Pay vto Commute 1 2 Decent place to work A lot of hours but good culture overall. Pay is pretty good, no drug testing unless you are on power equipment. A lot of people come back after they quit. Steady work, decent pay. Over worked no air They send employees to which ever building they want The have air (tdc) conditioning waiting on a new one. Associates like to be kids a tell on people for nothing. load of hours they don't care if you have kids fast paced work culture with mostly happy people Fun work culture with lots of travel and great pay. Hours can be long but generally rewarding. CAn get competitive but generally people work together to make the company goals. Work culture, pay long hours Great Company When I worked at Gap, I had a great experience. It depends who you work with. My store manager and DM were extremely caring and flexible. Work life balance was great, pay was good, benefits were okay. Doesn't Care About Their People A company that preaches growth but does absolutely nothing to help you do so. Constant restructures and no job security as well. Also, pay rate is severely lower than other companies. Good for a first job, that’s it If you’re working any other job besides sales associate you might be able to go up the ladder in terms of position, but besides that this job is good for high school and college kids Underpaid, make more at a gas station Managers do half the work, get paid much better. The push credit cards on the customers and “rewards”. You might get a piece of candy when you open one for the customer. Meanwhile, the company gets hundreds of thousands. I can’t imagine why the company is struggling… The majority of the “minions” doing the majority of the work are high school age and don’t know any better. Word of advice, work at Target. Much better pay, benefit are equal if not better. I loved gap Gap is a good company my store personally was super! They appreciate your anniversary’s working with them and they were great about time off, etc I recommend to anyone! Good lunch breaks None Productive fun place to work love it Great place to work i want to go back i re applied great and fulfilling job i would reccommend anyone to go there its a great experience a fun place to work No free lunch Shortbreaks Laid back It’s ok just have to deal with rude customers we had good management so it wasn’t to bad . But holidays are extremely crazy and fitting room bury is horrible If anything, do it as a part time job but… If you like mandatory overtime, this is a good job for you. To balance it out, they give you the option of leaving early when the phones are not as busy. I think management just depends on you get. Some are better at the job than others. Not sure if there is real room for growth. When I inquired I was always given a run around answer but I know people from other teams were promoted, even after short periods. Horrible I was in Picking. Barely trained. Timing is unrealistic. Short breaks. Management has no idea what they are doing. The job itself is extremely easy. The only good thing I can say is that I liked everyone I worked with. Over worked not enough pay If you’re a kid it’s a great job but can’t manage bills off this type of income. They’ll usually overwork you in order to keep their production up. Do not work here Terrible management The regional and district management including regional visual are antiquated and have no understanding of individual stores need to be successful. If you don’t agree with them when they visit or go get them Starbucks coffee, you are on the bad list. Great first job working here was a great experience! pay was not the best but it was great getting the experience of customer service. Met amazing people that became friends. management was also great! Convenient Job I worked this job while I was in college. It was great because my bosses were very flexible and helpful. The work is monotonous robot work but there's ways to make it more enjoyable. Food tended to be catered once a quarter if performance was good. Upper management was terrible though! it is nothing but politics and greed. You can move up in the company but don't try to become a manager here, they will string you along and use you while feeding you empty promises. 2 stars What is the best part of working at the company? The 4 ten hr days, What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Co workers , not motivated. Good pay, bad management The pay is good as you do get paid weekly but the hours can really burn you out after a while and sometimes the hours can be changed when you don't even know about it. There's no real care for personal life -3- Good pay Annoying people and bad management Decent place to work Work expectations vary on your department. There's typical warehouse job drama but nothing too bad. if you show up and work you’ll be fine. Be aware of what you do/say around supervisors. fun company Enjoyed my time with GAP as their customers are young and fun as well as the staff. Their clothes are awesome and employee discounts are outstanding. I enjoyed my time there Fun place to work but not good communication. I love working here but it’s just that I got a sh*ity shift Fri-Sun. Plus I feel like I’m always new every time I come to work. One day I came in on a Friday and thought wow am I late? Cause everyone was already working but truth is they all started early. And I didn’t even get a notice or phone call. Gap need to step up and have a better work app and better HR people. 1 It was okay Great job for college students, because they are flexible when it comes to scheduling. Each location is different, so keep this in mind when you apply. Pay was about the best thing there!! However during peak season, you will work no less then 70+ hrs a week. And your days go from 12hr shifts to 14hr shifts MANDATORY!!! Atleast 6 days or nights, most of the time 7days during peak And holidays Okay place This was a temp job. Definitely got me thru the holiday season. Calls were too serious. My supervisor micromanaged. No real relationship with managers 3 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Gap Inc. (old navy) is inclusive and appreciates hard work. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? But the most stressful thing is the hours because it’s consistently short staffed. Not only this but also they sometimes push peoples limits too hard. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? The work environment is friendly and management tries to be understanding but it is noticeable that they only care about the store at the end of the day. What is a typical day like for you at the company? A lot of register….like a LOT. They also are super pushy about credit card applications and hate when you don’t try to make people sign up. There is a lot that goes into running a store and unfortunately Old Navy doesn’t staff to hire just for cleaning so wiping down the bathrooms is something that comes with the job. Fun place to work! You won’t regret it The best place I’ve ever worked and hopefully I can start back working with them with a new position that’s not seasonal this time around. The managers really care about their employees. The customers are amazing! Little to no advancement opportunities When I was hired, I was told of all of the opportunities we would have to explore other departments and go up in the rankings. This was not true. Several departments lost their jobs due to third party companies taking their previous position, and ended up as a tier 1 phone service agent. This is a step backwards, not a step forward. They had to start completely over against tenured agents already in the department, and I was one of them. Many people in leadership, including those who I had as direct supervisors in my old position, have quit and moved on. I’m doing the same. If you’re looking for a remote position that’s easy enough to do and don’t mind the 0 advancement opportunities, be my guest. But this just wasn’t for me any longer. Fun workplace where the supervisors make you feel welcome Supervisors are responsive and helpful, with constructive criticism to help you improve. They are also kind and understanding when life happens. When I had to go on a leave of absence due to an injury the supervisor helped me every step of the way and checked in on me monthly while I was out to see if I needed help and how my condition was doing. Welcoming environment and flexible work schedule Healthcare Culture Gap has a great job culture, management is very supportive. Cafeteria food is great, discounts are awesome and really nice office on the Embarcadero!! Just an easy job This job is a typical call center job. I only worked here because I needed money, other than that I found myself bored and unfulfilled. For a call center, they pay below average, although they do make up for that with employee discount and benefits, if just wasn’t enough. Pros- Employee discount Time off/PTO benefits Flexible scheduling Cons- Not enough pay Deals with customers issues all day long Great place to work I loved working at Gap. The best part about the job was the coworkers and managers. The store I worked at was fairly small, so we were like a little family. It rarely got super busy, so most workdays were fairly relaxed. Managers were really accommodating with scheduling as well! like a family, relaxed atmosphere not great pay Great place to get initial corporate experience Depending on your role you'll have very typical monthly tasks that aren't bad once you get the hang of them. If you want to move up you have to put in the time and effort going above and beyond. They are eager to promote within. Getting in can be difficult - best to know someone that works there already and get referred. Best work/life balance Personal development is all on you, Not all leaders truly care about the growth of their employees Laid back and Flexible Overall Gap Inc is a great company to work for. Great work life balance. I would recommend anyone to work for gap. It’s a fully remote position which makes it even better! Seasonal Remote CSR I was only here briefly, but I really loved it. Very unlike the work I had done in my pre covid life. I was a seasonal CSR rep over the holidays during covid and really enjoyed the experience. Working from home was amazing, and working second shift fit my lifestyle perfectly. I had great trainers and great supervisors. Hoping for a call back at some point. Great place! My coworkers we're the best You do extra work because apparently they cut some people. Leaving the pressure on one person! Lie to you about your job status!! When you were supposed to be an consultant? Pay was ok for being at home. Training sucked. If your NOT a quick learner on the computer (meaning master it in 30mins)then don't try this!!! Good money for staying at home Not good training methods. No compassion. Working with top Dev Ops Cloud technologies. Flexibility in work location. Working with top Dev Ops Cloud technologies. Retail discount is abundance. People are smart and fair. Fast pace and learning. I learned a lot Great place to work, managers were good and training was also great. Sometimes will need to wait a bit of time for changes to be implemented but other then that I enjoyed my time. they have flexible schedules for just about anyone, great pay, and easy ways to make bonuses. they have flexible schedules for just about anyone, great pay, and easy ways to make bonuses. The work is not strenuous, and they have a large break area with lots of food and drink items to chose from. Great place to work. Lack of leadership I wasn’t trained about loads of important information in which I had to learn my self later in weeks even in months. Supervisors do nothing just talk. Lack of information about everything It’s cool place to work I think they should take the point system off because it doesn’t seem fair other then that it’s fair job interviews always go good you get paid for the first day
Schindler|" Great group of people to work with Learned a lot about time management The best part of the job is helping the field out of a bind. Sometimes the contractor makes a mistake onsite and the field needs a reliable fix as quickly as possible. Being able to provide that aid can give a very rewarding feeling. 2 Nice place to work to make a desent living but a bunch of young lazy workers work not to physical good benefits ,co workers pathetic drive right by when need parts don't respond to page .they gave nice compensation during the kung flu good benefits and management try there best to keep workers the old time schindlers are great but the new young workers are pathetic Could be better if people cared enough The work load is insane because the turnover rate is incredible high in the warehouse. People don’t want to stay because there’s too much work and there’s too much work because people don’t stay. This cycle won’t end unless management makes an effort to better the work conditions. The place honestly needs a union. High school This place is a joke. The employees are childish and management are in competent. They actually will hire anyone. It’s unnecessary stress and a lot of favoritism. Working at schindler Schindler is a company that moved their shared services from Ohio to Atlanta in October 2021. They are bias towards their people.. the people who relocated to Atlanta with the company. Leadership doesn’t know how to handle problems which only causes more issues and higher turnovers None No work/life balance, favoritism Overall Okay Company Minimal training for the job, and you were expected to succeed by yourself. I had 1500 accounts to cover by myself monthly without going over 40 hours. You are eligible for quarterly bonuses which was nice. Great career over my 30 years Business focus and methods are typical for a global corporation making money in the US. I am happy to have out run the axe to get to my 30 year anniversary. Not there yet Very poor strategy and structure in place. Not enough employees and burnout is real. Processes are nonexistent and I really feel bad for the new employees are going to take this over Purge Morristown Used to be a wonderful company with sincere customer focus. Employees felt appreciated and valued. Company has drastically changed over the last 5 years, and unfortunately, this has resulted in significant customer losses and employee turnover. There’s so much dead weight in Morristown—it needs to be purged from the top, to Human Resources, to many of the department heads. Productive environment with sufficient breaktime and lunch hour. Typical work hours Monday through Friday. I learned the accounting software SAP. Expanding the education of their employees was a priority. The atmosphere was friendly, clean, and safe. The priority of educating their employees. Company has decent potential but terrible processes and bad management Customer service is not a priority and management only cares about meeting numbers/metrics. Company culture is non existent and the processes (specifically software tools) are the worst I’ve ever experienced. Management has very little people and leadership skills. It seems like everyone there is only working for a paycheck and has 0 motivation/energy. Decent compensation, company car Bad management, horrible processes, high turnover, no culture, very uninspiring Overwhelmed when there's work, sent home after commuting over an hour Don't work here if you don't like being treated like a number. Management is in bed with the union not following supposed union rules. The day you're hired you're told that if you don't cut it they'll cut you. There can be a ton of work but they'll tell you to go home or not come in for no reason, again against union rules. Find a better union company to work for in the area but recognize they're all in bed with the local union. Greed, corruption, power and money. You're just a worthless number working here. Union Everything Horrible place to work - Management has no clue! Management only cares about profit - not about the customer, riding public or the employee even though they say they do. They give you 16 hours of work to do in an 8 hour day all well also having to take calls on broken units and dealing with irritated customers that has had broken equipment for weeks because management will not approve the parts that you ordered to get the job fixed. According to corporate you are never supposed to cover a longer shift than 12 hours in a day but it happens all most every time you are on call and they expect you to take the calls until the next shift starts. I had many days with 15- 20 hours in a day - said something many times but was ignored and told that it isn't a policy even though it was in our employee safety handbook. Lots of changes Currently company is going through a restructure which is causing major confusion to the day to day activities. Everyone seems to be running around in circles. Some of the sales rep who have worked very long in the position tends to not care. Lots of room for opportunity Overworked, Need leaders with clear vision Poor management Management will never take advice or stand up for you. They have more work than technicians and they show favoritism. No matter how hard you work they only point out mistakes. They do not care about there employees at all. The morale is low Overtime Micromanage, poor many Solely interested in profit margins Schindler is a classic company where they prioritize profits over employee happiness. Everyone is overwhelmed with too much work and you never get time off to yourself. Even when you're on vacation you feel like you're still working (and in some cases you truly are). No work/life balance. Money is good on paper but if you break it down to dollars per hours you're not making good money. Union work so.... Management is decent. The problem is you have grumpy old union guys that don't teach you anything because they are kinda dumb. Also, very dangerous trade, so I quit. Great Company My position was in the field, NOT Management. That being said it is what you make of it. You are on your own or work as a crew. The office gives you direction, not much in the way of assistance. You are expected (required) to complete the available training and continued education courses. Classic corporate structure and mindset with clueless management. If you like to be stressed out, this is the place for you. Facility is severely understaffed for the workload amount in terms of full time employees and the company relies way too much on unrelaible temporary help. You have 1 person doing the work of 2, sometimes 3 people. Employees are also severly underpaid. Plant manager is clueless as to what's happening in his departments and when teams get behind on work, his answer is always ""work 10 hour days during the week and 8 hours on Saturday and Sunday if need be"" instead of jumping in to help alleviate the issues. I also never had 1 development review in my almost 3 years working there, so evidently there's zero room for advancement. Just steer clear of working the production floor if you're looking at a job here. Good benefits, 10% 401k match. Underpaid, Understaffed, Daily stress, Clueless management, etc. Productive Its very good very pure i love it and like it and i will do everything for this company to be on the of world its a good place with friendly people who love to work Free lunches Short breaks Very little support. Very little support. Company is running it self into the ground. High turnover. No interprets . Managers do not help with anything and have no clue what’s actually going on. None, I guess insurance was ok. Everything . Managers want to take credit for everything and put you down Great group of people to work with Learned a lot about time management The best part of the job is helping the field out of a bind. Sometimes the contractor makes a mistake onsite and the field needs a reliable fix as quickly as possible. Being able to provide that aid can give a very rewarding feeling. 2 Convenient gym downstairs, co-workers were nice to work with The departments evolved to managers and worker bees, very short staffed, many demands to meet at all levels. Compensation and benefits were fair, had to work long hours 1 crisis by management / disorganized poor training too much of a work load. no confidence managers always changing from company to company never asking techs about problems/solution solving making company feel connected.... pay many labor violations., dicrimination, deception, lacking continuity 1 Horrible management You are going to basically be in your own if you are not on 1st shift. They dont follow through anything they say and good luck bringing anything up to them that needs changed because they will nod their heads and forget about it when you walk away. Great place to work I have worked at Schindler for over 10 years. The Managers listen to your input they also welcome feedback. The pay is very good and I am able to have the hours that I need. There is always overtime available if you would like to take it. Great pay. Flexible hours. Plenty of overtime Call center work can be stressful at times Complete mistake on my end. I have wanted to write this for a while. I stopped myself each time, I wanted to wait until I had something good to say about this company. Many months later I still do not have anything good to say. This has been the most trying and honestly the worst company I have ever worked for. You're immediate supervisor is great, the person they report to is not so great. No one in upper management cares about you or your wellbeing. You will be provided a very messed up schedule that is guaranteed to ensure you have no life outside this job. I personally think this is done intentionally so you will offer to work overtime since your day is already shot due to your schedule, not to mention you're working Saturday....EVERY SATURDAY. They always have tons of overtime available, simply because they can not keep employees, no one wants to work in a repetitive call center that has 70 calls holding with 30 minute hold times. People are working 16 hour days 7 days a week to help out. Not one member of management says so much as a thank you, you will be worked and bugged to work unreal long hours, you can say no, but, what's the point your 40 hour shift guarantees you have no life, might as well make money since you have no life right? I have worked at one point 12-16 hour days 7 days a week for 4 weeks, on my 1day off I was texed 3 times from management and asked to come in. Countless times I have been called and texed in the middle of the night after working 14 hour days and asked to cover the night shift plus my 12 hours the next day. When I say they dont care, they truly do not care about Not one Too many to list Unsupportive blaming management Schindler Elevator by far was the worst company I’ve worked for. The management team was unprofessional, unorganized and unsupportive. If you had an issue within the company and it was brought to HR they were more likely to fire you rather then handle the issue per handbook regulations. If you did what you were told you were penalized and questioned, if you did more then asked you were penalized and questioned, even upon giving proof of clear emails stating you were asked to do a task it was denied; nothing is rewarded. Over excessive work load, when asking for help- it gets denied or ignored completely. Very toxic environment, I did not meet a happy or satisfied employee within my department. Paid time off Inadequate training, unsupportive Management, toxic work environment Extremely dysfunctional Schindler is suffering from a lack of investment in the future of their manufacturing staff. They put no effort towards training or retaining employees. It is almost impossible to get fired, which may be a positive if you have attendance or substance abuse problems. This is a good job to get back on your feet, but a halfway house isn't a place to build a future. Also if you are an Electrical Engineer, RUN, it isn't worth it, do not even consider it. tons of vacation time you can take by the hour, no consequences Low pay, limited advancement, no training, no future Started out hectic, changed to more routine and challenging; then turned into pure bs and overwork . If you are not salaried, a lot of overtime is requested, sometimes mandatory so production goals can be met. Managers got bonuses when goals met; production received OT & verbal thanks. After a while it was expected. And then more requests for OT. Local management focused strictly on monthly goals, not Corporate stated mission. Shipped defective material to meet goals. Lot of favoritism in effect especially if you are female. Occasional free lunch if goals met Overwork, short staff, little praise, minimal communication. Terrible. Managemnat and leadership is terrible. Training and work processes are terrible. There are more temporary and contract workers than there are company employees. Longterm employment. Weak management. I worked for Schindler for 18yrs and was layed off for no reason. No severance pay. 18yrs of my life gone without a reason. This is truly the mark of the Schindler ""family"". Longterm employment No gratitude, as part of the Schindler ""family"". Great pay, but long work hours - Great Pay if you are willing to work endlessly - Definite favoritism exists within the company - Pressured into working overtime - Was let go for trying to better myself through education Great Pay, insurance is amazing Not home often, travel to different locations Great management. Schindler’s new service delivery was not good. Productive Great manager. Strong leadership Teamwork Multiple layers of approvals to complete a task. Relationships with co workers and customers Leadership Lack of maintenance hours. Best place I’ve worked for Schindler, is by far the best company I’ve worked for. I could work as much as I wanted. The pay was weekly and all the people were great. I miss working there very much. Things have changed over the past few years, no longer feel the excitement of going to work, or having to deal with poor management. Management makes departmental business decisions based on friendships or personal feelings rather than on achievements, work ethic, or contributions. Performance is often overlooked. Cafeteria on site Favoritism Large manufacturer with defined schedules and goals. Work culture depends upon the department that you are assigned to, some are busier than others and some experience seasonal crunch times where overtime is expected. Too much micro management and miss communication. Management takes on additional projects at the expense of the employees. Assist other departments when they don't even have the capacity to run their own department Great schedule and benefits. Poor management High expectations, no support Awful culture, new management comes in and micro manages projects until the customer is no longer happy, then retreats until project manager saves relationship just to swoop in and take credit, ultimately was promoted while pm role was “eliminated”. Very broad and ever changing scope of work, very much a boys club, and admin assistants are extremely taken advantage of. It’s a cess pool of toxic masculinity, where only the people that massage the managers who excel. Base salary is good Culture, management, health benefits Not the best place Company does not do enough to protect the women they employ. There's a lot of gossip and drama here and management doesn't do much to change that. In fact, they expect you to deal with it. I was told in my interview that I would be coming into a department that was pretty much ran by difficult people (mind you, the supervisor of that department was the one telling me this) and you kinda just have to hope they like you and deal with it. Not a bad place to work Company pays well. The job descriptions were a little inaccurate at the time I was working there. Pay is good however if you are a PM or Superintendent, expect to work 10+12 hours a day or more if you are in a large office. Pay You work all the time and will not catch up. Understaffed on the PM side nice work place Pretty good to make a carrer in Schindler, even if you want to go to another countries there's that possibilitie always there. And the work load is pretty managable, with good conditions. Great group of people to work with Learned a lot about time management The best part of the job is helping the field out of a bind. Sometimes the contractor makes a mistake onsite and the field needs a reliable fix as quickly as possible. Being able to provide that aid can give a very rewarding feeling. 2 Poor communication I've worked at Schindler for over a year now. In my tenure I have never once felt like there was any sense of communication between all the levels or management. 1 Good company, tough industry. Schindler is one of the better companies to work for in the elevator industry. Good culture and good pay. However, the job is very challenging due to limited labor resources and lack of accountability for operations. As an account manager, you are constantly getting calls from upset customer due to commitments not being met. You have to continually make excuses for the company and be able to deflect at a high level. Good company but just not an industry to build career, especially in service. Limited opportunities for growth and promotions. Pay and autonomy Industry, limited labor, dealing with customer complaints constantly. 1 Great Manager and the best people to work with. Excellent office, best leadership, every day was challenging, lots of support from team. Field guys, very smart hardworking, and most helpful. Great people to work with. Celebrated every office team members Bday, coffee (fresh ground) free breakfast, lunches, bouns insensitive None Great hard working people. I work with some great people and customers. Schindler is extremely profitable and liquid. However, little of this is passed on to the employees. OT has been taken away, but work load has significantly increased. Not bad It is a good place to work. You will work hard and learn but itd a trade made for some and not made for others. Great company though with potential for sure The people are great, management NEEDS replaced! Just as the header says... the people are great but management needs replaced. Nobody in management had any idea what the others were doing. The only communication was pretty much work faster, even though we didn't have the parts necessary to complete our jobs. Bringing in people from other countries with poor English and no desire to help the business was another huge flaw this company had. They hire through temp but won't actually hire you on after your contract is up. Fellow grunts are great, work is easy, employee benefits Anyone above a team lead good pay. Good bit of PTO All they care about is getting numbers. The management does not worry about people or their issues. All they care is if the product is getting out of the door. good pay unorganized Nice location Promoting the wrong people, without degree or experience, based only on personal favors or likeness. Nice location, grounds. Manager, without people skills. Productive and goal driven place to work I really enjoyed the fast paced and goal driven work at Schindler. Only down side was that some are stretched very thin and asked to do the work of 2-3 people which made it difficult to be able to focus on the main objectives. Great pay Life work balance at times Steer clear Branch Manager was extremely abusive. Told HR numerous times but they did nothing. Customers on the service side canceled left and right. No one cared and it showed. Health care Abusive Manager Watch your back awful place to work. Turnover is very very high. Suoervisors are very two faced never would i recommend this company.. the call center manager is not a good and fair person to work for. If you are liked yoh will get special favors like scheduling and promotions pay management Would not recommend working for this company This company dose not support our military as a reservest they would give me a hard time when needed to take time off for my AT and drill weekends and when I was deployed overseas and came back they really gave me a hard time at work by management so they made so hard on me I had to leave the company None Many. Terrible Corporate Structure The turnover at this place is unreal. Don’t give anyone a chance to succeed. You have no authority in any position. Management changes their focus so often it’s impossible to hit the goals set. Health insurance is expensive. Only positive out of this company is the mechanics are well experienced, but the company changes their product so often with no training and then throw the mechanics under the bus. Awful. Compensation is good, but not worth it Management Terrible Upper Management Team I had more then one intimidating and unprofessional experiences with the upper management team in the call center division of this company. Because the Human Resources turnover rate is high. Nobody is handling their abuse Great Seasoned Employees Great Trainer Never felt accepted or appreciated Great job but a little unrealistic They expect you to drop everything in your life and be there as soon as you get the job no 2 weeks notice for previous employer, no help with relocation but over all it could be a great career Muy buena... Muy buena ambiente competitivo, de superación profesional , con mucha dedicación. Management maturity How some Sr Managers got there is really a mystery Company not mature enough to do what they say they are doing re: diversity, inclusion, compliance, collaboraction, ethics, and other non-financial and longer term goals. Teams do not work in harmony but solos... Truly a family This company, although tasked with the employment of union labor, was able to make us all feel like we had a home. In nearlyevery role on the company level the people made an effort to know you and your needs. Family Constantly in war with union Customer service is number 1 Customer service is very important to Schindler Elevator. Loved working with the field staff.. Safety is Number one at Schindler elevator. Schindler elevator corp takes care of their employees.. Busy but fun work. Exceptionally Strong Supportive Team at Schindler Hawaii Lean staffing in a small office, but strong team-oriented performers in every position. Extremely supportive environment where everyone is motivated to go the extra mile to do a great job. Great group of people to work with Learned a lot about time management The best part of the job is helping the field out of a bind. Sometimes the contractor makes a mistake onsite and the field needs a reliable fix as quickly as possible. Being able to provide that aid can give a very rewarding feeling. 2 No organization When I was welding here half the jams would be missing so I wouldn't have complete sets to weld or other welders would leave my site a mess or they would finish a couple sets of jambs and leave the rack a mess so I would have to organize before I could work 1 Opportunity for engineers but you need to seek it out. In the Morristown and Randolph headquarters, I have had a very successful career as an engineer, project manager, department manager, etc. with many promotions and significant pay increases over a long career at Schindler so I am often asked for advice. My advice is not unique to Schindler but applies to most large corporations and the sooner you realize that the only person who cares about your career is you the better. Most jobs functions eventually get old so don't expect anyone (boss or otherwise) to have a career plan developed for you. If you are willing to seek out internal company opportunities and if you have shown to be a value, then your boss will typically help make it happen. Having a bad attitude because you no longer like your job is not going to help your career. Internal transfers are typically welcomed at Schindler like most large corporations and speaking as a boss I knew what I was getting with an internal transfer so when done right everyone wins. Do the job you currently have as best you can but take advantage of being employed by a large international corporation like Schindler and you will find you can change jobs, change careers, get promotions, even relocate throughout the world without ever leaving Schindler. Schindler is still a great company as it has taken me to many places throughout the world and has been professionally very rewarding. Great Company, Shady and Dishonest Office Culture It was fun at first, but when they need someone to blame to for the mistakes and and unmet deadlines, they start at the bottom of the ladder. Its a stressful office atmosphere. Great pay and benefits Sneaky and dishonest office culture, and very stressful. great crew Working for Schindler has been a good experience, always something new to learn. The work environment was easy going and everyone worked together to complete deadlines. Good pay Too many layers of management that have set goals too high to achieve. Large turn around of supervisors. Upper management has to be more hands on in the local offices Good pay Long hours Scsn Dont trust anyone in SCHINDLER elevator call center employees when working at SCHINDLER elevator. Again until SCHINDLER elevator replace amy sherman call center manager it will never grow to Potential it could be. Employee Safety Although the company spend millions on safety. It’s all a big show the Safety Director is more of a politician than a safety Director. Disgraceful considering the Company truly wants proficiency. One bad apple does spoil the whole bunch. About Schindler Easy Slow pace. I loved the hours I could get a full day and still work 8hrs. The meetings were fun in the morning. I learned about new and different elevators. The system they use there's broken They demand you be flexible but won't be flexible 5min for you. Clear favoritism. They treat tempts not as potential hire in employees but less than. High turn over but clearly it's everyone else's fault. Horrible Place to work It is just a bad place to work. The environment and morale are horrible. There is no room for advancement. They do not develop talent. Upper management and the human resource department is terrible. Good place to work Schindler is a good place to work. The elevator industry is an old industry, but Schindler is making a good effort to become and stay current in business systems and practices. You can't trust Management It is not a good place to work. There are some good people that work there and there are some good things about the company. There is new management and everyone feels like they are walking on thin ice. No comment No comment very professional company, good structure, some good management. Good corporate headquarters. some employees milk their time instead of working hard, and they are very fair on most, great benefits None I enjoyed working there. If I hadn't needed to relocate to Nevada, I would still be working there. It is a fun environment, they really care about their employees. Na It’s a good job good pay but the company doesn’t have any 1st position jobs available only 2nd shift and 3rd shift is available till they complete there expansion Productive place It's a productive and fast paced place to work. Overall the management are friendly and eager to help you out. All the employees seem to get along and work good together. bonuses not enough raises Horrible work place Don't work there! They treat their employees horrible! They are not safe!!! Its is extremely hot in their facility! They do not promote from within. Good office = Longevity Some very toxic big Egos in this industry. If you land in the right Office you can expect a long career. If it’s a Toxic office it seems to show a revolving door of professionals moving through. Money and Perks and PTO Superintendents and Project Managers Worst Experience Ever The woman that was in charge of ""training"" didn't want me to have the position which I didn't learn about until I gave my two weeks notice. She willing left out information because her ""friend"" didn't get the job. Great work environment I would have to say all in all I had a great time working there the things that had learned have helped me and benefited me when it comes to how things are conducted in-and-out of an office environment as well as In-and-out of a Union environment Great group of people to work with Learned a lot about time management The best part of the job is helping the field out of a bind. Sometimes the contractor makes a mistake onsite and the field needs a reliable fix as quickly as possible. Being able to provide that aid can give a very rewarding feeling. 2 It was a decent job to work The job it self isn’t very hard for me but the work we do and the money we get paid doesn’t go hand in hand for the skills I bring to the table I mean if they paid better and got rid of some of the people that don’t do things like they are supposed to and not putting it on others that would be a great job to work for Has good benefits and good hours Not enough money for the job at hand and people expecting you to do their job 3 1 Forced Temp Agency Worked for a temp agency threw them for 6 months. Pay is lack luster, benefits are decent. Hiring process took 6 weeks. Management is unorganized, would NOT recommend! 2 1 No life work balance, Great employees except for supervisors and management Requires a lot of overtime’s and odd inconsistent hours supervisors are bad with barely any leadership skills. Many careless mistakes are made, and must be fixed by other people. More fun than work oriented Too much fun leads to low productive which results in fingers pointed in the wrong direction. Tools to do your job are up to date and available. Guidance to improve job performance is minimal or non-responsive. No room for advancement in many departments. Need to be able to work independently Need to be able to work independently. There is some good training. They try to make it a team environment to work in. There is a lot of management to back you up. The contract job that didnt follow through Got hired to work there via staffing agency to process the payroll but when I got there I was answering phones and cleaning reports. All of sudden they hired a permanent to process payroll. Then I found out 2 days before my end date that I wasnt needed anymore No advancement for people Unless you are a recent college graduate with a masters degree or higher you are never going to do anything other than what you were hired to do. You can be there for years and have additional duties but no advancement OR title changes In other words if you’re middle-aged you’re a irrelevant horrible Really bad moral. Management is horrible everyone has their own agenda. Everyone is for them self no team players. No support from anyone to solve problems. Management This company says they focus on the customer but that is far from their goal. They put all the weight of customer dissatisfaction on the lower tiered employees while changing nothing about that operation that leads to dissatisfaction. Good people Good company to work for Great benefits Good pay Great bonus opportunities Ability to be promoted within Team driven Great safety culture Always provides opportunities to learn Productive and fun place to work Friendly place, great workers and always some exciting work available to do. I enjoyed cross team validation for product quality and accuracy Great pay, but little upward mobility. Fast Pace and Monitored on your calls The people who work for Schindler are fantastic people. The Management team is not always there for you when you need them the most example: On a difficult call they are usually not at their desks. Call Center Employees are very helpful if they are able to help you with a certain call. Very fast pace. You sit at your desk most of the day. You get two 15 min breaks and a 30 min lunch. The people around you are helpful You have to work on Saturdays & loud place limited opportunities corporate has made changes that make the branch offices struggle. management is not open about decisions or processes. poor management has lead to losing great talent. Great place to work Learned valuable project management skills on a daily basis. Good people who want to help you succeed. Had little knowledge prior to start and was effectively trained. after college learning experience This was my first job out of college (BSME) and it was a good learning experience, while I was not a mechanical engineer at this company I still found that I did a lot of problem solving and really learned a lot about how the real world works. You will always be blindsighted You can be fired or demoted overnight, despite your good performance. Without warning this may happen and depending on which management you're under you can be developed or demoted. No rhyme or reason here. Great place Worked for 15 years. Would have finished career here, however the 2009 slowdown led to cuts in the staffing. Highly recommend this company for those interested. Poor management but trying to recover Doing the work of 1 1/2 - 2 people on a regular basis. Very hard to focus when going in many directions at once. No advancement. No annual review or merit increase. Experience can vary greatly based on your direct manager Life varies dramatically between field operations and head office. Each branch operates like it's own small business and each department operates in a silo. Although the company is making efforts to reduce the silo effect. To date, many of those on the front line are competing against each other because their bosses are unable to find a common ground when setting objectives. autonomy, meaningful work competing interests Plenty of room for success They have systems in place giving you the proper tools to succeed. they were concerned about your family life and what they could to help. provided training as necessary."
The Hartford|" A great place to work for 30 years! There is leading edge technology in Insurance to remain competitive. The Hartford has been and continues to be one of the best places to work in the Hartford area and in Insurance in general. The work life balance and how employees are treated has always been their biggest selling point. From a technology stand point, The Hartford is leading edge in Web, Cloud and Data technologies. Work Life balance Job opportunities, Diversity and Inclusion is a priority, Technology opportunities, The People are great, One of the top Ethical companies. 1 7 Watch for RIF's Actively recruited and put in a division which was successful. Company made acquisition and poof - everyone on the Hartford side was gone - and new Management of acquired firm took over. Fast forward, all that management is gone. Great while it lasts but you need to look over your shoulder for knee jerk changes. Good pay, zero work life balance Demanding duties with zero work life balance. There is good pay but seems more of an attempt to justify the level of unnecessary stress. You may get a good supervisor or not, overall company goals are unclear with minimum support. Flexibility with remote work but pointless due to constant pressure of high demands. Employees who take advantage get away with a lot so others suffer with covering their workload. Remote work Zero work life balance, no support, favoritism abundant 2 Great work environment Great work environment - people, culture, focus on well-being (physical, mental, and financial), ERGs - the whole person; Can be challenging to find progression when ready. Inclusive Work Atmosphere I was pleasantly surprised about the experience I had working at The Hartford. My colleagues were great, and management, specifically my manager, was excellent. Diversity was good. My team had lots of representation. Also, everyone was very supportive when you reached out for help and this included people outside of my team. Very laid back, but I believe it was specific to the area in IT where I worked. Work-life balance was excellent. There was no expectation to work on the weekends or after hours. If you did, you did so because of some kind of intrinsic motivation, not because you were expected to. The pay was ok, but it was ultimately the reason I left. Horrible training The training was sub par. You get thrown on the phones eith limited training and resources. Nit a steady schedule, had to work into the evening some weejs Great company It’s a great company to work for definitely one of the higher paying companies but come with stress and real goals or numbers you have to meet in order to get your service star bonus which can be a significant amount Great pto and benefits package and people to work with Sometimes their goal and reality don’t align waft Decent place to work Overall the company is a ""decent"" place to work however most positions that are not management are paid fairly below most companies which has caused high turnover. The company culture is good and the pride themselves on being inclusive to everyone which they. They also support cross training and support career advancement. Middle management however needs more skills on how to EFFECTIVELY manage and not micro manage. Upper Management is good, good benefits but the pay just doesn't cut current market value for the positions. If you are not in management you are likely underpaid. Interesting work but bad managers are protected Worked for good and bad managers over the years. PTo difficult in some roles. Poor work life balance in many roles where expectations exceed time allotted. Poor managers and misogynists are protected as well as just plain ugly folks who are favs. I grew my career greatly thru my own efforts. Lock you into roles for “business needs” for years. Will hire from outside vs inside which hampers career growth. Great benefits! Lots of good experienced staff (10+ years) and “golden high profile” management has left in the last two years. Many remote options which is well supported. Good benefits Bad managers are protected 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? The people and benefits are great. The Hartford is an awesome place to work. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? I don't think any of it is really too stressful if you are trained properly for that position What is the work environment and culture like at the company? This is agreat company with open door policy. It's like family here What is a typical day like for you at the company? It's very busy. You can never say you are bored. Depends on the job you do, you are always on the phone helping people Has its ups and downs Great management and culture, however the customers are very difficult to deal with at times. There is a lot to learn and at a quick pace when going through training, but the trainers/managers do their best to provide you with as much guidance as possible. Great place to work I've seen plenty of reviews here some you can tell the department others not so much. As for me I'm in Aarp home and auto service and yes the customers can be quiet difficult, but they pay a fair bit of money to deal with it. Over the year since I started last August I've gone from a base of 39k to 47k a year I also get a 5 percent shift differential for working biweekly Saturdays and quarterly bonuses my last bonus was a grand. I believe it's honestly the department the biggest complaint in mine is the customers and a few minor tech things that could be improved upon. Our managers are supportive and helpful beyond anything I've ever seen. There are different levels of my current position I started level I of course least year and I'm looking at level 3 before the end of the year. I do work multiple things for my manager and consisitenly help my team and others and I do those things of my own volition not because I'm required to do so. Yes as a call center there are always metrics and yes as in any call center as management if you're not meeting those metrics they will bring it to you, but in my experience in a positive way to build a plan to improve them and help YOU further your career. I've never been treated better than here. The only thing I absolutely cannot get behind is the survey system and there not being a way for them to account for a survey that honestly had nothing to do with you but was taken out on you. pretty much anything else surveys, rude customers Benefits and in need of job, overall stressful and training sucks Training was very uneasy for me. It was too fast pace and they then throw you onto the phones be day learn that content then next day learn new content and apply the past lessons and go on, it’s not user friendly and not worth my stress or health Fast paced and stressful This is a great company to work for. They take care of their employees and make you feel appreciated. However, the call center producer role was very stressful. Every aspect of your day was a metric to be measured. Takes great care of their employees I have never worked for a company that was so focused on the well being of their employees. The pay and benefits are mazing. The intense training is top notch. I will retire from this company. Great company and people Awesome place to work and the best products to sell. Strong culture that allows you to have a great work life balance. You do have great support from leadership and opportunities for career advancement. Great company for a career I worked here for 27 years and loved my career here. The Hartford treated me well and I got to move around a lot. I had 13 jobs within those years and most of them were because I wanted to move. A few were because of reorgs but the opportunities were great. I took over 100 courses in education over my tenure there and there were lots of opportunities to give back to the community in the surrounding area too. Great bosses because they were trained and hired well Too many reorgs for my taste Ability to work 100% remote. Great company. The only downside is it can feel big and bureaucratic sometimes. But that is pretty typical for any company of this size. I feel very fortunate that I was able to build a career at The Hartford. Good experience Good place to work. Learned a lot. Good bonuses. Good time off. Support and training was provided to help learn and grow in position. I recommend working there. Legacy systems In general, the people are friendly and helpful. The work itself though is not that interesting, as many legacy systems are dependent on old technology like VB.NET, and there is a great deal of technical debt. Great benefits good place to work They have great benefits and it was a good place to work. I enjoyed my time there but wanted tome up and there weren't any opportunities that presented themself. A great place to work for 30 years! There is leading edge technology in Insurance to remain competitive. The Hartford has been and continues to be one of the best places to work in the Hartford area and in Insurance in general. The work life balance and how employees are treated has always been their biggest selling point. From a technology stand point, The Hartford is leading edge in Web, Cloud and Data technologies. Work Life balance Job opportunities, Diversity and Inclusion is a priority, Technology opportunities, The People are great, One of the top Ethical companies. 1 7 Great place to work I love it it’s amazing management works for you easy to move up and explore different departments. Decent pay and very transparent about everything in the company. You get what you give After 30 years. I was let go at age 58. I love the company, great people, great pay, great opportunities especially if you are self-motivated. But…layoffs are always a background threat. You may get passed by year after year but seems we all get caught eventually especially as you get older but not just the oldest. I believe if your pay is high and they can do it cheaper some other way, they will let you go. Their bottom line is their bottom line, but you are treated well. Just stay valuable to them and you’ll go a long way. Lots of great opportunities and some great extra benefits. They listen to you and include you. Not all management is created equal. Some are great some not so much. Great place to work! I love working at The Hartford. The company promotes inclusivity and stresses the importance of a work-life balance. Working remotely allows me the flexibility to work and be present for my children's recitals and school activities. It is a positive work environment without the toxic backstabbing and bickering that I have experienced in other places. I truly feel that my work is valued within my team and throughout the company. My one complaint is that the health insurance is not the greatest for people that require a lot of medical care and prescriptions. While the premium is lower than what I have paid with other employers the coverage isn't great. The highest plan is more of a co-insurance which requires more out of pocket costs. Great place to work Excellent place to work. Bonuses are great. Raises are low in comparison to other companies. Not many opportunities for growth within the clinical area Terrible culture no work life balance They took bonuses away but in turn gave tons more work. Calls are horrible. Culture is horrible leads to mental stress and anxiety. No work life balance. Great place to work! Work life balance at the Hartford is second to none. If friendly work environment and supports of teammates are what you are looking for in an employer, this is the place for you! On-site fitness center, private park, flexible work arrangement, work life balance, free parking in downtown Hartford. Excellent Workplace Culture Excellent workplace culture where you feel valued as an individual and are granted high flexibility. Team is dedicated to supporting each other to get the work done. Upward mobility is difficult in some departments and bonuses/promotions aren't always granted based on merit. Pay & benefits are on the lower end, they display a pay scale on job descriptions but internal offers often come in on the lower end of that scale. Overall, great place to work but compensation isn't very competitive. Overall Great Place to Work! I enjoyed my time at The Hartford. My manager(s) were great, understanding and knowledgeable. They definitely cared about your performance and how they can help at all times. Expectations were set and you were given the tools to meet them. I can only speak for myself, but my manager was definitely top tier and went out the way for myself and my teammates in whatever way we asked. Flexibility and Remote Pay & Lack of Movement Great company Good Company to work for - cares about veterans and special needs individuals. No reservation about working there. If desired, apply for a job there. Wfh Hybrid Nice place to work It is a call center environment, so expect to be taking calls most of the day. Mondays are the busiest. You're mostly dealing with older customers about automotive/home insurance so patience is key. I appreciated that the company trained you well and encouraged you to be the best at your job. Learning is continuous and I know at least within our team, you're rewarded for good work. This is a really good place to work... I have worked in the IT field for 35 years for numerous companies and this is by far the best there's been. This is a company where you're valued for the human you are. Nothing more, nothing less. And its refreshing Outstanding People to work with Days can get long Busy with constant changes Constant back to back calls, guidelines always changing, opportunities for growth but you need to go way above and beyond to be considered. Very demanding. Solid company with plenty of opportunities to succeed. The Hartford provides nearly limitless tools and opportunities to succeed. Development options and advancement are part of the culture. There is no one direct path to build your career. You can do whatever you enjoy. Managers are genuine and sincerely want to develop you. Pressure in numbers Sale or fail is the daily conversation Constantly pushed to engage in Teams conversation Good PTO Good health benefits Repetitive work, clique type of environment Has become a boiler room Back to back calls from alot of people who do not know their address. Management pushes your time card through and holds 15 minute huddles where they talk and talk and repeat things over and over to take up the whole 15 mins. But that is it. They are paid quite alot to do that, and spend most of their time in meetings supposedly. But they arent real managers. No support or coaching, but they do make money off the sales reps back, and in return, you will sell 100 policies and get 1k for it. Do not work here. This company has changed so much in the past year. Boiler room. Great atmosphere Lots of amazing and talented individuals that are always willing to share their expertise and knowledge. The company is very big on diversity and inclusion and provides training for leaders and individuals to respect everyone. Decent... The workload of this job is a lot. There is a lot in training they do not go over. You are expected to meet your goals every day. If you have one day where you did not meet metrics, they will be sure let you know it out. Pay is decent and the PTO is decent. If you do not wish to work in a call center this is not the job for you Decent I was there for 12 years, learned a lot but was stuck in the same position and I just wasn't happy. The culture has gone from quality to quantity and if you don't like skipping steps and providing lackluster customer service it's a decent job. Great place to work Loved working both in office and remote. If I ever got the opportunity to work here again, I’d take it. There is a remote only work option now that they did not renew the lease on the building. Great Company The Hartford is a great company to work for. They are forward-thinking and inclusive. Management does care about employee work-life balance and does everything in their power to help maintain happy employees. A great place to work for 30 years! There is leading edge technology in Insurance to remain competitive. The Hartford has been and continues to be one of the best places to work in the Hartford area and in Insurance in general. The work life balance and how employees are treated has always been their biggest selling point. From a technology stand point, The Hartford is leading edge in Web, Cloud and Data technologies. Work Life balance Job opportunities, Diversity and Inclusion is a priority, Technology opportunities, The People are great, One of the top Ethical companies. 1 7 Decent employer, unrealistic workload and lack of training Decent employer. Workload is unrealistic and training is not long enough. Metrics are unreasonable. I haven’t been in this position long and I’m already regretting it. 2 It’s okay if you like status quo This place is a great fit for professionals who are used to working at legacy companies. The culture is okay; leadership was decent. The pay is not great Great culture, interesting work, chance to grow After a long career at smaller companies this is my first corporate role. I didn't know what to expect and am more than happy with my decision to come here. A great team, interesting work, managers who care about my success - at a company that I feel truly cares about its employees and about doing the right thing across the board - sounds too good to be true, but it's not. Of course it's a corporate job so there is corporate stuff you have to do - but the benefits far outweigh any of that. Difficult work, but fully remote My job involves working with insurer and policy holders. It involves a lot of hand holding and direction. However, for the most part I feel appreciated. fully work from home and great benefis high turnover in staffing decent I worked in the disability call center for three years. It was around the pandemic when I realized that I was done with the call center because of the level of stress. There's so many made up metrics that they hold you accountable for and there is plenty of micromanaging going on. If you don't mind being a robot answering the same four questions every day, week, month, and year then the call center is for you. My schedule was M-F which is the only thing I liked and the ability to work from home but the pay needs to be increased for call center workers. Bad manager The manager always had favorite agent if you were their favorite they would treat others with different actions not a team player . Some of the people would make up stuff so you would get in trouble for false accusations Love working for The Hartford I started in Jan 2022 and thoroughly enjoy working here. Management is very supportive and encourages advancement. Extensive training, but it was very helpful. Stifling atmosphere The job involves doing the same thing over and over and over again. I was never permitted to work on tasks that displayed my strengths, and became increasingly detached and burnt out. Insurance agents are often rude and inconsiderate. My first manager made no effort to match their employees with their skills and interests, and seemed most preoccupied with ensuring that most of their employees never advanced beyond their department. Management also plays favorites; those are the only individuals who ever get promoted or receive bonuses. Management also strongly discourages the discussion of salaries and wages (very telling, because not only do they play favorites, but they also pay significantly less than Travelers, who was their biggest competitor at the time). All in all, I got a few transferable skills from this job, and not much else. Benefits Short breaks, short lunch, low pay, managers play favorites, clientele is rude and incompetent, job is mind-numbingly boring 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? You were able to work remotely What is the most stressful part about working at the company? It's not a stressful job once you learn their system What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Diverse company to work for What is a typical day like for you at the company? A typical day consist of answering the phone and assisting customers with their insurance Pros and cons No work life balance although wfh is a big plus. 55-60 hr week to meet unrealistic metrics is the norm. Extreme micromanaging is just managing to leadership. There are good teams and good managers, but that’s probably heavily dependent on their own managers values and expectations. Great company overall Wonderful company, great benefits and generous PTO. However...about 2 yrs ago they laid-off a TON of people! Ever since, we have been severely understaffed and overworked. Not typical of the decade prior and hopeful they will continue to hire, to protect the sanity of us still with the company. I think of leaving often, as they pay less than their competitors, but with their convenient remote work option and time-off, I'll likely stay-put. Good Company for starting out your career I log into work then get on the phones, where I take inbound calls for auto an home insurance. I've learned integrity selling and hoe to be ethical from a business aspect. Job is tough but company makes it worth it The job itself can be challenging and stressful, but my management truly does their best to make things better. Compensation and bonus are above market. 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? They care about their employees, you’re not just a number on a list. They’re also extremely diverse. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Personally I don’t believe there are any, the atmosphere is so welcoming and calm, this is a company you can get comfortable and build a career. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Calm, stress free, comforting and diverse! Flexibke Flexibility at work but hard to move around company/to different positions. Can’t always take time off you want as you can only have so many people in your department take off at one time Great team of people, overworked, insane amount of claims youre expected to handle People,trainers and supervisor were great. The workload is insanely heavy, which explains why turnover in claims is so high. I couldnt find another job soon enough. If you take a job in claims tons of other companies will try to recruit you because they cant keep people either. STAY AWAY FROM CLAIMS ADJUSTER JOBS Great team of people Heavy workload, benefits arent great and expensive Times are changing Culture is very different than it was a few years ago. There’s still plenty of good things, but it’s no longer special. Great senior leadership in the field has been replaced by mediocre leaders who don’t seem to care. Remote work, pay, flexibility, technology Workload, new senior leadership is disconnected from reality. Very Stressful, no work life balance case load is insane for a lot of analysts, even the experienced analysts that have been there years are overwhelmed with the amount of case loads that they have. pay is good but very little work life balance. benefits huge caseloads Great Company The Hartford taught me a lot about the job industry. It was my first “real job”, and it was a fabulous one! They are very good to their staff, and they do play everything by the book. It was a great company, I just couldn’t take being stuck behind a desk selling insurance all day. Everything else about the company was wonderful! Great pay and benefits but management is as passive aggressive as it gets. Doing clinical impressions, as a nurse, is repetitive but easy enough. I began with a trainer and team lead that were both supportive and encouraging in every possible way. My lead took a different role and was replaced by a robotic passive aggressive type that just made the work day miserable in every sense. I don't care how good the pay is. As a nurse, I have the choice to not feel defeated the minute I clock in. Pay and benefits Passive aggressive management A great place to work for 30 years! There is leading edge technology in Insurance to remain competitive. The Hartford has been and continues to be one of the best places to work in the Hartford area and in Insurance in general. The work life balance and how employees are treated has always been their biggest selling point. From a technology stand point, The Hartford is leading edge in Web, Cloud and Data technologies. Work Life balance Job opportunities, Diversity and Inclusion is a priority, Technology opportunities, The People are great, One of the top Ethical companies. 1 7 4 stars What is the best part of working at the company? The Training and development that was offered. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? ]Never experienced any stress. It was my best Job overall. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Professional, Respect and always take ownership o your work. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Making sure that Security Ports are covered and they have the tools to work with. Coordinate building repairs and ordering of office supplies and equipments. Respond to building emergencies. Oversee Health Environment and safety issues. Understaffed The stress level was maxed out. The company did a voluntary layoff which forced extra work on everyone which continued as they constantly restructured. Criminal’s at best If you’re not quickly accepted in to the clique or prepared to marry your job they will ostracize and exempt you like the claims they always decline…just know, you’re a number expected to meet numbers… No advancement opportunities Do not work in a call center! You are only looked at based on metrics. As long as you are hitting your metrics, things are copacetic. Stop hitting these metrics and you will be shown the door. Overworked and underpaid Management clicks take advantage and reward and bonus up their favorites. The benefits were really good and competitive. The workload and time balance was off resulting in salaried 50 to 60 hour work weeks. Good benefits High stress It’s what you make of it. If you put in the time the work will pay off Prior to going remote I really enjoyed the job and we had an office. Once we went remote, a lot of the perks of the job went downhill. It seems there is always never enough staff, especially considering how busy all insurance companies are across-the-board. Good pay, plenty of PTO No coverage for your PTO, lack of staffing. Great longetivy, not enough training! After the second week they have you taking insurance calls, not enough time to actually learn and service calls, don't like it. Also the schedules are definately not flexible, working m-f until late and have to work every other saturday Horrible Not a good place to work. Terrible management. Supervisor was not qualified for her job and was very difficult to work for. HR was unresponsive and unhelpful. Remote work options Working remote is a great option. We have flexibility to take time for appointments/childcare when needed and flex our work schedules. Workload balance is an issue. There are still not enough employees for the work tasks that have to be completed. Typical big Insurance company but becoming more a remote culture due to pandemic effects Great place to work and train. Diversity and inclusion taken seriously and it shows. Good management for the most part. Always known as a great place to train and get experience. Remote work readily available Very supportive to employees It’s a great company to work for. The team leaders are awesome and very supportive. They want their employees to succeed. Overall it’s a great career. Non-stop calls. Negate Manager Non-stop calls and major micromanaged My manager I was assigned to was always beating up our team. Telling us how we needed to improve. Hardly any positive feedback. No recognition at all The salary is pretty good but the bonus/commission was not good. If you do overtime, don’t take breaks or lunch you might hit $90K. Great training and benefits Okay first job It was a great first job to start with. High volume work. The job became increasingly stressful after a while. During covid they laid employees off and I took the opportunity to get out of claims. Though I don’t miss claims, I do miss the benefits this company provided. They paid on student loans, lower than standard healthcare pricing, paid money towards gym membership just to name a few. Hour breaks, hybrid schedule, Benefits High volume work environment, pressure from management without them having the experience of an auto adjuster Great insurance job It is what you would expect out of an insurance company, they pay well and have excellent benefits, work/ life balance could be better and training style as well. Hmm It can be a lot, so far so good though. The training , although helpful, needs to be longer. There’s a lot they don’t really prepare you for, it’s something they should look into. Major change in operations leads to horrible results from employees I have worked at The Hartford for almost a decade in the claims department for workers’ compensation and have to put in a review of what’s going on for prospecting new hires. Look elsewhere. I started off my career here with aspirations of upward mobility and a lot of fun and great times. The culture was wonderful, management had open door policies, and work was stressful but rewarding. There has been an immense shift in the past year with procedures leading to the decline of the claims side of the company. The amount of work began to pile up, as covid hit. Initially it was easily taken care of in our teams, as we dispersed the work amongst many people to make it easier. Then it became difficult. We voiced our concerns with management, but they always indicated “we were above our hiring model in terms of people”, therefore they would not hire additional representatives to help lighten the load. This soon became a slippery slope. Our competition was slowly poaching people who have been here for decades and offering them SUBSTANTIAL pay increases. Ranging from $15k or more. As a result, team members had to bear the enormous weight of handling other people’s work, as well as their own and we’re expected to get it completed. Their only alleviation to this was to tell us to work on the weekends or stay later in the week. This would be a normal reaction to most industries, but The Hartford and management stressed the crucial importance of work life balance for years. In all my years, I maybe worked a few weekends to catch up after PTO here and there, but they wanted us to work on PTO was above average, 401k match They monitor your screen time down to the last minute, extremely stressful, lack of work life balance, corporate culture shifted, opportunities to grow your career are very rare, they will expect you to work longer hours than you’re hired on for Not for me Training was a train wreck. They had us taking complicated insurance calls the first week. In my opinion they set us up for failure. The callers are all from AARP who are forced to go digital pay training Old boys Club I would avoid working here. The only focus in on shareholders and not the EE's. Competition and non-cooperation strongly the EE is encouraged. the corporate communication is double speak. Stressful Training program was overall pretty good. Mandatory overtime caused little to no work-life balance. Very stressful to be so micromanaged. Depending on the team lead, your experience can be a nightmare. No comment Lots of issues with management. The New people had to do the work of lazy tenured people. Uncaring management. Overall, was not the best environment. None Lots A great place to work for 30 years! There is leading edge technology in Insurance to remain competitive. The Hartford has been and continues to be one of the best places to work in the Hartford area and in Insurance in general.

They pride themselves on Diversity and Inclusion. Managers listen and strongly encourage self-development. Work/life balance is the best part of work for this company. 2 Good company stable, steady Good company with good benefits and compensation. Best for those who prefer stability over aggressive change or technical innovation. Best for team players, collaborators and not the best place for ""rock stars"". Insurance Career You are a driven and motivated problem solver ready to pursue meaningful work. You strive to make an impact every day & not only at work, but in your personal life and community too. If that sounds like you, then you've landed in the right place. Great place to work Good work life balance and great people and benefits! One of the best parts was being able to move up so quick and have the support from Management to do so I love the people I work with and the teams that I support throughout the organization. The company cultivates a diverse and inclusive work environment. Each person can bring their whole self to work without fear. Things are always changing at The Hartford, so there is always something new to learn. Management is supportive of career development for their staff. The people are the best part of the job. The hardest part of the job is sometimes having to wait for decisions to be made. Personal Line Agent The Hartford is really a great company to work for. Management is very supportive and the staff appreciation is really shown. People can nominate you for prizes if they see that you have been doing great work. Kind and helpful management Training Great compensation Cal center In my opinion...they changed! I worked in Financial Products for more than ten years. I was proud to work at the Hartford until after the last. Hartford acquired a new insurance company. Senior management suddenly top caring about people. They clearly had a plan of execution and only advised those who needed to know. There's more work than you can keep up with. New admin systems are filled with bugs and defects. The personable nature of the work culture disappeared. Little path to advancement. Great benefit package and 401k. Some years the bonus payment were nice. This company is too big; lost a lot of it's charm. Na I have nothing bad to say about the company. Just got burnt out from the job. It's a stressful job and difficult to truly have work/home life balance Not for true IT professionals Easy work as a developer, but also mundane. Not a lot of team cohesion, and constant re orgs. Great place for young devs fresh out of college, not a seasoned professional. Left to do your own sprint work. Everything else. Good people, pleasant busy office Made some good friends there, was an all- around decent job with good training. Good opportunity especially with no experience. Often steady to busy but never seemed hectic. Includes tornado shelter. Training, Tornado shelter, Pleasant environment A lot of time on the phone They really take care of their employees and are serious about wanting everyone to feel welcome. I interviewed internally after making connections through networking. The process was straight forward and everyone was clear on what they wanted for the job. Great atmosphere and the benefits are great There is nothing bad to say I really can't say nothing bad about it great company great people to work with always busy All good great benefits, flexible for sick days vacation days family emergencies definitely a career upgrade so you can further your education and still work I love the work from home Yeah I would be nice if we had an hour lunch but it's okay it was all good Not bad for entry level position Pro: Great managers, lots of pto, great benefits, sense of team! Cons: If csr lots of incoming calls with time away from customer always being watched, customer surveys metric not always obtainable. Great managers, pto, benefits A lot of incoming calls, customer surveys Excellent experience all around! Excellent culture overall. Top leadership is inclusive of all with the focus on employee engagement and enablement. The Hartford provides flexible work. A typical week I will visit 3 clients and then write up my reports. I have a great team and feel full engaged even though I'm a remote worker . Inspiring leadership team, great bonuses, collaborative work environment, flexible, and rewarding. Merit pay could be more in line with industry averages based on geography, but bonuses usually make up for this. Not the job for me The job was dealing mostly with agents and servicing commercial policies. There was no room for advancement. The agents were rude and demanding. They had the opportunity to process their own work online but refused. Nothing I can think of Poor management. No room for advancement or raised. Productive, team oriented, believe and encourages growth. Upon my hire in 2020, it was a challenging change. With working outside of a remote position. But this was a change worth it. With The Hartford I finally feel like I have a career where I can grow. I have a wonderful manager and team that encourages you to grow. It is a very fast paced environment, where there is times you feel as you can’t breath. But it is very rewarding overall. Pay, Bonuses, Benefits, and Growth Very Fast Paced Not what I expected I’m a current Claims Processor, and I am by far the most miserable I’ve ever been at a job. I feel set up to fail by the company and management. You can almost guarantee everyday my boss will give me wrong information that seems almost deliberately so that I will mess up. Since I have started work, it’s more than apparent that no one on my team likes or respects me as a nee hire. The training is awful and poorly conducted. I am currently seeking new employment and when I get a job offer else where, I’m not even giving notice because I not only fear the treatment I will get but I don’t even feel it’s deserving of my notice based on the level of disrespect I’ve received from my peers, management, and the company as a whole. Schedule Management, flexibility, no empathy for employees, training, lack of advancement opportunities. They talk the talk, but don't walk the walk They like to talk about how great they are, but when it comes down to it, they don't care about the customers or employees. Borderline taking advantage of elderly. This company cares fully about their employees. Working for the Hartford was amazing. The benefits are top tier. The flexibility they gave me in my schedule was priceless as a single mother of 3. My compensation package made life comfortable fiscally for my children and I. I didn't have to have 3 jobs. Part of your employment is furthering your career, priority goes to internal education and promotion. You cannot go wrong accepting a position here. They afforded me the luxury of creating a schedule in which I could balance career and parenting. My office was in Bloomington which isn't the best commute but the other perks made it so worth it. Overall its a great place to work and advance company is overall a great place to work I have my faults but its nothing worth noting and can be reflected on my personal preferences. when you look at the bottom line the company encourages advancing and work life balance what else could you want from a company that also strives to be competitive with pay? Advancement, Networking, Work life balance Short breaks, as a CSR you cant solve 95% of the calls you get."
Bohemia Interactive Simulations| Great people to work with Overall, the company's greatest asset is probably its people. Co-workers are friendly and fun to be around and while I wasn't the largest fan of all management, my manager was an excellent person didn't just care about whether I was getting my work done but actively wanted to see me succeed in pursuing my dreams, even if the company itself wasn't a part of them. Additionally, while I didn't always agree with higher management on decisions, they always did an excellent job of informing people why decisions were being made and are attempting to help me find a new job since I was let go. Very cool problems As an engineer on the support team, every day was different, which was really fun. Sometimes it would be working on customer support problems, others it would be estimates on proposed features, or working on those requests. Every team has different products they work on, and in support I had line of sight on most of those projects. There was some travel required for this role. The company really does care about being a good place to work, they have some outstanding people, and they are growing. I would strongly recommend them for anyone looking to develop their skills in C++, Visual Studio, and simulation. Communication is probably the biggest weakness, but with growing teams scattered across multiple continents, that is fairly predictable. I have confidence that management will come up with solutions for this. 1 Great people to work with Overall, the company's greatest asset is probably its people.

Okta|" great WLB, not challenged enough Pros: good WLB, people are nice and prompt to help. Cons: engineers are assigned to small cells, no architecture problem need to worry about. Backend is a big monolith and development productivity is unbelievable low due to the tech debt/pipeline/code size. Fun and competitive Great place to work! Managers are always looking to help you any way possible. Super flexible PTO, average compensation. Great work life balance amazing offices Good company, excellent product, decent pay & benefits. Management is not the best.. At the top C-Level the company strategy and product is great! The benefits are good and my peers were smart, supportive and fun! But sadly some Director level managers. do no empower their employees, believing in a micro-management approach. Really a bit weird in this day and age. 1 Amazing culture with great benefits Best place I've ever worked! Culture and people are amazing. The current challenge is the constant product changes mixed with a lot of turnover. The day to day job is increasingly challenging but the mission and vision is a great one. New Leadership Change the Company Significant amount on new senior leadership has destroyed what was a good company culture. Company is struggling to re-establish trust in senior management with a significant amount of turnover occurring in the last year. Good technology Deteriorating culture Fun workplace This is the best employer I ever had so far in terms of everything, culture, people, benefits etc. All of my teammates are very helpful specialy my manager. IT and HR are very responsive if you have any issues, they are all easy to approach. Mobile phone and internet allowance None Okta inc. Working at OkTA for the brief time I did it was uplifting. The environment was cheerful and focused. Benefits are the best can't beat them. Always knew what was going on communication was efficient. Good communication Large work load Great product, bad company Management is completely disconnected from their satellite offices. There was very minimal support or interaction of any kind. Any promises made by leadership were NEVER followed through on. Culture is non-existent. Great company, sales team is cut throat Promotion track was very bottle neck. Members of the team were there over two years after being promised a promotion after one. Great company that just went public a few years ago. Snacks and free lunches Very cut throat environment Decent place to work if you are happy doing the same thing without advancement or change Been out of there almost 3 years. Don't miss it at all. It was a sexist work environment. I know people that would like working there...those people lack ambition, but need a paycheck. Productive workspace Coworkers are motivated and the organization puts a lot of resources into providing teaching to new sales reps. Heavy investments in technology to assist in prospecting. Management Needs work Great place to work but needs some work. Management needs work. The mananger I worked under did not seem like he really wanted me to succeed in the company. Bad Management Great benefits for employees a good place to work working in SF startup is challenge, it expects more from you, daily tasks are fully loaded. But the company culture is very nice, especially if you are work in a positive group. Great people, great product. From a sales standpoint Okta is an amazing place to work because the product works. The engineers and developers are top notch. The sales goals are undeniably aggressive but the sales teams continue to preform and as a result the stock has grown significantly since the IPO. Great product, great people Enjoy Working Here This is a great company if you can roll with changes and pick things up quickly. We've been rapidly expanding for 3 years and scaling is our secret sauce. Glossy Veneer, Rough Reality At first Okta seemed like the perfect environment to learn and grow while contributing to the success of a company whose product and culture were something to be proud of. Unfortunately the reality fell miles short of that. The marketing team lacks structure when it comes to process, micro-management abounds, and despite their claims of work life balance there is little flexibility and an unspoken expectation that you should be available round the clock. In retrospect the company slogan of ""Always On"" should've been a massive red flag because that ethos doesn't just apply to their tech it is literally how they approach work. In my time at Okta I came to regard everything said by leadership with the same level of skepticism one would consider Orwell's doublespeak. There was always just enough inane, toilet-book motivation to mask the cut throat corporateering. I wouldn't recommend them as an employer. In fact, my advice is to stay away. compensation was decent micro managers. fear based culture, lack of diversity, horrible food, cliquey, no work life balance, cut throat Management Management needs to learn from its employees by listening to them. It is kind of another good old boys club. I think behind closed doors with management, it is a different perspective. Web marketing Be advised that fear, incompetent managers, and cliquey-ness prevail. They'll lure you in with the lip service they pay to work/life balance (which is nonexistent), catered lunches, and onsite fitness classes etc (both of which are ploys to get you to never leave and work round the clock). Basically this is Valley Millennial culture at it's ugliest. The place is teeming with over-indulged, overpaid children. Apply if you're okay with being chained to Slack and email nights and weekends and are cool with passive aggressiveness and managers who prefer to micromanage every task rather than learn how to lead a team, offer guidance, or develop their direct reports. no work life balance, typical Silicon Valley bro (because I can't use the word I'd like to use) culture, cut throat, fear based atmosphere n/a good company to work for, a lot of opportunities for career advancement and growth. good, open office culture; very collaborative environment, fun after-work activities Productive and encouraging workplace. As a high school senior, most businesses do not believe in youth workers to be as efficient as their current workers. Even though our internship was not as long as we hoped; workers at OKTA encourages my fellow classmates and I to overcome fears, become comfortable in offices with older individuals, and most importantly, how to make sure that we were able to enjoy ourselves while being professional. High paced environment Working at Okta was a rewarding and educational experience. Learned to work in an open space environment and collaborate with multiple departments. Great experience! great WLB, not challenged enough Pros: good WLB, people are nice and prompt to help. Cons: engineers are assigned to small cells, no architecture problem need to worry about. Backend is a big monolith and development productivity is unbelievable low due to the tech debt/pipeline/code size. Good Company, Fun Culture, Better Management Pros Great sales environment; everyone there wants to be successful and make enough money to survive SF, but that does not mean they selfishly will not lend you a hand if you find yourself in the hole. Open sales floor with a lot of experience. All you need to do is ask and people will open up to you. Great product; since I have left, I have seen the stock soar. This tells me that the product has really come into … Show More Cons There has been a lot of trial and error in terms of structuring and company layout. You need to be able to roll with the punches here as restructuring often goes hand in hand with poor communication. The sales training was nonexistent when I arrived. It was good and bad as you really had to figure it out. But when I asked in the interview for specific sales training and they said yes, I was disappointed with the reality. Advice to Management Don't pass the buck...own it 6 1 It was aite I met a lot of great people and learned some great skills. Like all jobs, it had its good and it had its bad. Such is life at any job in the Bay Area. 1 3 Culture Not willing to help you grow or advance. Everyone watches their own back and are two faced. Very cliquey culture. Really research who will be on your team before joining. One of the best enviornments Fast paced, but lots of perks like 3 day a week free lunch service. Growing company with an exciting atmosphere. Very very transparent with weekly All Hands meetings. Great workplace somewhat cut throat Productive workplace Great management and respective culture. You work with intelligent coworkers who are always open to learn more. Sales team are confident and backed by great products Free Great culture and room for advancement Working at Okta has been absolutely great thus far. After 6 months, I have personally seen the things they told me about in the interviews (mainly being opportunity for advancement). The work life balance is excellent - work hard, play hard. Free lunch, snacks, mezzanine area Not a structured training program (when I was hired) Great company with innovative approach to Identity & Access Mgt. Okta provides a unique approach to delivering Identity and Application Security controls as a multi-tenant cloud service. The IAM space though is very competitive. Okta is still a very new name, especially in the Southeast and the adoption of cloud services is still somewhat lagging. Great, energetic environment… Ping pong table, keg, X-Box Absolutely amazing internship experience working with the Marketing team. I learned a lot about event planning, social media research. Developed great communication skills, expanded my knowledge of the tech industry and learned how to work in a fast paced environment. great WLB, not challenged enough Pros: good WLB, people are nice and prompt to help. Cons: engineers are assigned to small cells, no architecture problem need to worry about. Backend is a big monolith and development productivity is unbelievable low due to the tech debt/pipeline/code size. Fun and competitive Great place to work!

BD|" BD is one of the best! The location was Columbus Nebraska, MDS division. It’s a high volume and efficiency manufacturer of single use medical products. Great people to work with. Proprietary manufacturing technology. 3 Okay workplace High turnover. Great benefits. Low pays. Understaffed. Not enough resources to meet deadlines. Bad management. Friendly coworkers. Need more hires for certain Departments Great team to work with Training is a week-long. But not too boring! Decent place to work. Depending on department. Physical as well as mental work. Would work there again. When it’s good it’s good and when it’s bad it’s real bad Job is easy enough. Sometimes management isn’t the best. It’s a great place to work when everything is clicking but thats been rare lately. Has a cafe in break room but even that has gone downhill over the years. Flexible hours Uncomfortable work attire Una empresa excelente para mí la mejor que he estado La evaluación es muy positiva. Trabajé agusto y compatible mi vida laboral con la familiar. Productive and fun place I’ve been working here since the beginning of May and I have been doing a lot of things that are going to get done and I’m just trying not be stressed about anything I don’t want you guys going through all the stress of this situation I don’t know if you know that or if you’re still in a position of responsibility but I’m not really worried at this time about the stress. Great company employee first mentality. Many benefits, lots of PTO. Great company good values. Overall happy, management could be better. Once you get to a certain level it's all about a** kissing and being a ""yes man"" to advance. Also for some reason rarely promotes from within as if none of current employees are ready for the next step. No succession plan for lower management. So if you're hourly associate Great place, if you're at the supervisor level looking for advancement I do not recommend. Good pay, lots of Pto, Employee first company Bias management in upper level, promotion based on being a ""yes man"". No succession plan for lower management or associates. It’s a job The management at the customer service level is unorganized. If you are new there’s not one specific person to go to if you have any questions, as a result you will sit there with a customer on the line waiting for an answer or the customer will hang up. They need a better training system and instructor. Occasional free lunches Hard to get a raise Clueless, overwhelmed, and unorganized. I wanted my time at BD to work, I really did. I'll start off with the few good parts: I thought pay and benefits were good, and workforce was very diverse. The people who run BD are clueless. They have meetings to prepare for meetings to prepare for even more meetings, therefore, nothing ever gets done and they wonder why that is. Absolutely 0 sense of teamwork since everyone is always in a meeting to help each other out. Managers set employees up for failure with no training structure, no motivation, and unrealistic expectations. I really don't know how the place functioned, maybe I was just unlucky to be in one of the worst departments. Poorly managed company with tons of room for improvement This company has given several former sales representatives “PTSD!” Do not walk—run away if considering a job here! Sales reps are held accountable for tasks that are another area’s responsibility. You feel like you are constantly trying to “herd cats” in order to get projects completed in a timely manner. No real support except for the camaraderie between other sales representatives in the field suffering from the same issues. Pays well but don’t expect to have a good work and home life balance. The pay and benefits is some of the best around. You need to be prepared to sacrifice your home life though. If your department has staffing issues be prepared to have mandatory overtime. You are able to pick and choose your overtime hours but if you do not sign up, you will be volunteered. If you can’t not work said OT hours it becomes your responsibility to find a coworker to take the hours for you. Essentially you are just another cog in a this businesses machine. If you can’t keep up with production quotas you probably won’t be kept around for very long. There isn’t really any natural job advancement either, you could work your same job at the same pay for 30 years and BD wouldn’t have an issue with it. BD claims to be a “Family company” but in the 6 years I worked there I saw no family values. The turnover rate is very high. Not because the job is hard but it can be stressful. A lot of people just don’t feel like their coordinators or the company as a whole really cares about them. Lunch is paid as long as you don’t clock out. There is shift trading. The work culture sucks. Terrible Don't bother, there are much better places to work. Zero respect to the production employees. The pay, vacation, and benefits are below industry standard. 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? The people. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? There was no stress What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Very relaxing What is a typical day like for you at the company? Researching Working with a sense of purpose to help others Overall great work environment with a majority of team members that truly care for each other, their community and the work they do everyday. Culture of helping one another when a coworker is going through something difficult in their life. Manufacturing work is mostly high skill and detailed work. The company has great benefits It is a good company, but not a lot of room for advancement. The leadership changed in 2020. Things may be different now. It is a strong and established company to work for. Medical benefits, salary, and work life balance Not a whole lot of room for advancement. 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? They pay well. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Sitting in meetings where the speaker is lying, they know they are lying, and everyone in the room knows it's a lie. But your getting paid well so you have to shut up and be part of the lie. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Oppressive - Top Down Driven - Tyranical. The demand for output is very low. Most of the effort is put into hiding problems and finding blame. Group think is required. Independant thought or action unwelcome. Training says ""employees are not to be trusted."" Managers are political appointee's not hired based on merit, nor judged on performance. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Nothing but meetings and lists. We would even have meetings about meetings to review lists about lists. A pure bureaucracy Great workplace and culture Culture here has been amazing Forward thinkers always looking to innovate Managers are awesome and definitely focus on career development + technical skill development. Situation as a contractor might be a little complex. 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? The people and the goals of the company What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Losing my job to reorg What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Friendly and supportive Dedicated people Constantly changing leadership, who didn’t always implement best work practices. Not appreciating the hard working employees. Not allowing a employee to transfer within the company. Have interview I’m trying to see reviews have interview there soon. I’m looking for a decent hybrid job in the San Antonio area and came across this. Slightly discouraged because I see that they’re not apt to train you well If it were nit for the miney many would not be there I am thankful for the employment, but you are treated as a number. If you forget that they will remind you. The money is good, but as long as you are a regular entry worker you are disposable The pay and benefits Literally everything else BD is one of the best! The location was Columbus Nebraska, MDS division. It’s a high volume and efficiency manufacturer of single use medical products. Great people to work with. Proprietary manufacturing technology. 3 Really depends on your manager and the business unit BD is a large company, so there are many opportunities for advancement if one is willing to relocate. For the high-volume plants, be ready to work in a very stressful and fast-paced environment. Being in a support function like project management seems to have better work/life balance. Benefits good, coworkers not so much The company has very good benefits and decent pay. The only concern I had was the people working there, no one wanted to train you, and they wouldn’t want to help you or answer any questions about the work. Most of the time they would do it for you without explaining and expect you to do it on your own. Workable Environment If you are looking for a well paying job with good benefits then this is a good place to start with. Normally easygoing coworkers provide a good environment. Healthcare Benefits, Pay Scale Management Waste of time I had heard of BD as a great manufacturing company where employees are valued and respected. I did not see any of this at the Grayson location. The culture in this particular plant is one of neglect and resistance to change. Managers abuse of their power and they see new employees as a threat. The buildings are so old they are musty and even creepy and all they do to fix it is paint, and paint again. I would NOT recommend this plant to anyone. Wasted 20 years of my life there Poor management poor HR department hours suck. They don’t care about employees they don’t provide a opportunity to advance unless u know someone higher up or sleep your way to the top Too many constant changes directed by management I worked at bd for 10 ten years. 2 were as a temp, before being hired as full time. I loved my job. The people inside the clean room are amazing people to work with. The problem is management. Too many changes that doesn’t make sense to the actual workers. Changing procedures that slow down the process that works. Constantly making changes to a clean room that has been doing the same work for decades. If something is not broken,, why try to fix it.. i decided to leave for myself. It’s the company’s business as to how they run it. But it’s my business to keep safe and make sure that I always love my work. Production in the company It is terrible with the management and not listening to the associates concern and problems about the work conditions in the company and pay raise machine are broken and no to be repaired everyday Don’t do it. Worked there for years . Went years without a review.. at that the high school drama that management allowed to happen? Plus the terrible benefits . And the low pay for the area . Not worth it Best decision I will retire with BD! Excellent benefits, pay, work-life balance, and opportunity for advancement. Excellent Communication and transparency from the top and endless perks! Best decision I ever made! Its pointless, hood and childish Its a dead end. If you are in your 20`s- 30`S then go. Don`t go there if you have goals. You will get stuck. You can see it in their eyes that they gave up. The kids are just going to be kids. I know you may just need to get something for now ( Thats what I did to keep child support happy) if thats the case, dont stop looking for something better. Trust me. Nothing comes to mind. Seriously A dead end Workplace Relaxing workplace but management and the way some workers are treated aren’t fair. But a real chill environment, 4 day work week 10 hour shift. Overtime but not all the time. Great Pay not the Best Conditions The pay is amazing. The benefits are good, but having the basic tools and materials needed to do your job are not always present. Company has mandated overtime causing a lot of people to make mistakes, and be in trouble due to attendance. When you need a technician to help at times they can be snarky instead of coming in to help (although some are great at helping but a vast majority will complain and then help) It's Who you know, not What you know I have been here at BD for almost 5 years and Ive been applying for a higher position, which I think i qualify for, for the last two. I've only one interview and one phone interview for two separate jobs and didn't get neither. The management team do not listen but give commands all day for a job they haven't had the opportunity to understands what that particular person goes through. Overall after working here I will Never work on the production floor again. You have to fake it to make it to survive in this workplace Able to work with family, if any Short breaks, work like a robot for 12 hours Opportunities for those who fit the culture BD Sumter is a very large manufacturing facility which has five business units and is one of the largest manufacturing plants in the BD network. Each of these business units is large enough to be a stand-alone manufacturing plant and the plant as a whole produces a staggering amount of product. The products have longevity and market share - so the plant is stable and has had a very long life. The benefits are good - although the standard relatively high deductive health insurance applies. Wages are good for the area as well as bonus potential. In order to enjoy your job or do more than just survive at the salaried professional and management levels - you must be a person who is driven toward achieving/exceeding goals and has the ability to see opportunities for improvement and develop a plan to achieve those with a relative degree of independence. This often translates into long days and a challenging work/life balance. If you are not assertive and goal driven, you will find BD Sumter a difficult place to work. The hourly employees are relatively stable upon day shift - although there is turnover on the night shifts. While improving, there are too many grey areas for accountability amongst the hourly employees. If you are identified as an employee with potential, you will be given opportunities to show that you are ready for a higher level role. If you are not identified as such, it's challenging to get promoted. There is a backlog of tenured day shift supervisors and managers - so you will have to make a decision if you are willing to wait for a position to open or search Very nice employee’s, not well enough training I enjoyed working for BD. Management is very understanding of your personal life and work load. They will even jump in to help you or find someone who can help you. The only thing that sucks is their training. I learned very important things about my job after having done it months later. The training is very basic, and when you ask for help, it’s often met with “weren’t trained on this?”. Um, no. That’s why I’m asking. Pay was great but it’s frustrating when you don’t have the resources or training required to complete a task that is being expected of you. Hardworking/ productive but management sucks The work is easy to learn, very busy, but management is sorry. Lots of favoritism and micromanagement. Good workers that mind business and hardworking gets overlooked while trouble makers get all positions. But hey they have good perks and benefits Loyalty I worked for BD for 19 years. Was a hard working and loyal employee who would work 70 hours a week at times and went above and beyond. Strictly worked with the executive leadership team, including the CEO, and CFO. Very hypocritical as the company did not have a mandatory vaccine policy in place, but when it was known that I was not vaccinated I was immediately let go. The new CEO is horrible to be kind. He is a greedy and selfish little man. Management sucks and favoritism is high The management is constantly changing leaving the employees to do as please. The work does not equate to pay and people who actually do their job get treated like trash. None Everything Not a bad place to work Good-ol-boy culture. Be careful . Other than that nice place to work. The pay is competitive. Be very very careful with who you associate your self with. Everyone is not for your best interest. Decent place Needs better management and short staffed. Doesn’t feel like your work is being appreciated. A lot of days can be overwhelming. Other the that the pay is good and a okay place to work for. Wasn’t overall bad. BD is one of the best! The location was Columbus Nebraska, MDS division. It’s a high volume and efficiency manufacturer of single use medical products. Great people to work with. Proprietary manufacturing technology. 3 It's a job with a dating pool. It's a job. Some great people some bad.. They pay like a slot machine but manage like a 3 legged dog trying to run in a straight. You wanna make easy money and ruin your current relationship have at it ....want a life ?stay away $$$$$ you can make alot of money and find a date everywhere night. Managers are all out for themselves N/a Very family-oriented environment, but a complete and utter absence or structure and zero continuity! Polices in place that make it almost impossible to fire even the most inept employees! Great Work-Life Balance, Family-oriented environment Low Pay BD Used to be ranked up at the top, but has cost cut their way down the list BD used to be good at rewarding high performers, but year-after-year cost cutting has eroded this practice. Raises are not keeping up with cost of living, or inflation. Most long term employees are very high seniority, because most new employees start here for a short time, and then find jobs elsewhere. Low stress environment Yearly raises don't keep up with cost of living or inflation, Management won't be proactive about this problem and wait until most of the talent has left. Good Pay Good pay. Time off was good. Not far from home. Shutdown two time a year for time off. Good benefits. Clean place to work. Cafeteria on site with food trucks some days. Great opportunity, good benefits BD is a great place to work. The campus is beautiful. Managers were great. People are fun. Corporate parties where awesome. Left because my contract was up otherwise I wouldve stayed. Inclusive environment, meaningful work, solid managerial team Working at BD was educational and rewarding in a lot of ways. The medical menu factoring industry is not my field of study or interest but I very much enjoyed the people that I worked with in Carol Stream, IL. Quality Assurance needs individuals who are focused and determined to meet the month’s quota of product. It is not a department for the faint of heart. Management, staff, benefits Can be long hours but opportunity for over time Certain departments make for a toxic work environment My experience will likely differ from others but I suggest making sure you get with an actual trainer. No official trainers were available at the time of my hire so I got stuck with the the most toxic of people who surely didn't know how to properly teach anyone anything. It made me go from really excited to be working there to hating every scheduled day. compensation, work life balance, long breaks Toxic work environment, management Great place to learn Great place to learn how to work on machines, but it is a terrible place to work. No pay raises, hard work, terrible management. Enjoy being just a number, and if you don't like it... Don't let the door hit you on the way out. Nothing really Everything Good place to work can be stressful with long hours Challenging work. They lack on regonizing associates on their hard work. People want compensation for going out of their way not just ""good job"". Pat me in the wallet not on the back. Horrible on training. For the most part good company Good company but hard to get promoted. Been working for BD for several years. Good amount of PTO and insurance is good. Pay is sometimes less than average. It was ok Not a great experience did not see a career there not much else to say manager was ok the VP did engage with us very much I was overall very disappointed with my time at BD 2 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Decent pay, convenient job location, good coworkers What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Regardless of how hard you work, it will never be rewarded. Only when your numbers start slipping do they ever talk about it. They talk you up in their bi-annual reviews but then never actually pay you what their own ratings say you’re worth. Also very poorly managed with poor communication and leadership with severe superiority complexes and micromanagement issues. Decent pay, terrible people to work with If you want to get into trouble for everything and anything then BD has an opportunity for you! Was only there for a short amount of time and people spread rumors and lied, basically there’s a lot of bullies. If you tell a joke they will call you disrespectful and inappropriate. If you want to have no fun at work then BD has an opportunity for you! If you want to be stressed out quick into the job, forced to get numbers every week all on your own when you’re supposed to have people helping you then BD has an opportunity for you! Just don’t waste your time, go to angiodynamics or medline instead this place is a joke highly wouldn’t recommend. Oh and you only get a 30 min break a day on a 9-10 hour shift. Large, technology forward company Good company. Spends money on technology. Smart people. Good pay and benefits. Lots of locations. Travel and non-travel positions. 24x7x365 production at most locations. Very poor support in training I was hired under false information regarding my work description. Was expected to operate machinery without full training and complete knowledge of the operation of the department and was left solely alone to perform the task at hand Don’t do it Avoid BD. Management is out of touch and exclusive. They have high turn over and open positions for a reason. You’ll see it when you start. Immediately abandoned. Servant Leadership at its best This company is like no other that I have worked for. The team is amazing, upper management supports everyone and takes input to help drive the company forward. I would highly recommend this company. Everything about BD is great I can't think of any terrible managment always short of help but management expects the same amount and quality of work to be done as if fully staffed. If a person complains about any problems in the department management retaliation is not uncommon. Hazardous, Rushed Training, Poor Culture Don’t work at the Madison or Covington plants. They were bought by BD from BARD, and the transition has been rough to say the least. Poor management structure where everyone tries to push their responsibilities on to others, often overwhelming them. High chemical exposure risk. Rapidly degrading equipment. Many compounding technology issues. Rushed trainings. All of which contributes to an overall dissatisfied workforce. Madison plant lacks basically any amenities. For the risk and responsibility of non-management operations positions, pay is not adequate. Raises are a tiny percentage and applied across the board, meaning there is really no motivation to perform better than others. Why should the best employees get insulted by getting the same raise as the worst? I hope this helps someone make an informed decision! Nice people, Management needs help Management has gone down hill. Lack of culture awareness and what it takes to keep employees excited about work. Packaging department is overworked and underpaid. Huge turn over rate as of late. BD is one of the best! The location was Columbus Nebraska, MDS division. It’s a high volume and efficiency manufacturer of single use medical products. Great people to work with. Proprietary manufacturing technology. 3 Supportive Management and Teammates Management for my team is the best I’ve ever worked with. They are quick to address issues and want their employees to succeed. Teammates are actively encouraged to help each other lear and it is demonstrated throughout the entire department I love working at BD! BD has such a strong emphasis on quality which is so necessary in the medical field. I love that everyone is committed to get the job done right and always prioritizes ethical decisions. Management really cares about every employee and wants to help you develop your career. I love working at BD! ambiente de trabajo un poco tóxico Muchos de los group leaders trabajan a conveniencia de ellos y no de la compañia y si ven que tu sabes mas que ellos te meten el pie, te roban ideas e inventan cosas que tu como empleado nunca hicistes y a muchos supervisores les gusta eso ya que no van mucho al area de trabajo y creen que tienen buenas personas supervisando sus areas de trabajo y adicional a eso te mienten sobre las plazas disponibles, llenas las plazas regulares atravez de la pagina de la compañia y ni siquiera te llaman para entrevista o te dicen que no hay plazas disponibles Trabajo comodo, en aire acondicionado Turnos de trabajo There’s not much to feel good about working here. It’s a place that just keeps overloading you with work with no resources. Work somewhere else. Your health, your family and your sanity will thank you for it. This is not a place to learn or feel good about yourself. Constant reorgs and backstabbing co workers. It’s AWFUL. RUN. Management makeover/ company needs more diversity This company/facility here in Sumter, could use a management make over. They often try to make changes at the bottom, but sometimes change is required at the head. There's is an evident buddy system, when it comes to advancement and job placement. Management is not made up of great leaders, so they in turn promote not so great leaders into lead positions, which keeps things stagnant as far as learning advancement and diversity. They should utilize more resources for employee development. Vacations shift swaps 401k retirement benefits Management Short Staffing Employee development Can be great This is all in the Wingsets department, I cant speak for other departments. Leadership team above the floor supervisors create a toxic work environment. They will turn a blind eye at letting maintenance issues slide as long as production goals are meet. As anyone in maintenance knows, you can let things slide for so long and eventually it all brakes. If your the unlucky one that gets stuck holding the bag, then you get questioned as to why things aren't running the way they should. Production is king even though they say otherwise. If a QA associate does there job too well they are criticized for it. Zero incentive to do the right thing. Constant squabbling among employees, more drama then a day time soap opera but as long as you can produce, a blind eye is turned. Don't speak your mind, just say what the leadership team wants to hear and you'll be a favorite. No employee respect When I was there they didn't care about the people they only cared about their little clique really had no respect for the people if they wanted you to stay 14 hours you had to stay 14 hours Going home Management It's a good starting job. They pay well and benefits also good. It's a pretty good starting job. The hours, loud machines, and bright lights can get tiring. Pay and benefits pretty good. Other than that, I have nothing else to say about this company. Benefits 12 hours, standing on your feet whole shift, loud machines and very bright lights Productive Company has great benefits with good pay. Focused on production. Work life balance is average. Management is good. Overall this is a really good company to work for. Great pay great benefits Great place to work. Communication is the key to success. I have learned to communicate with my team lead. The somewhat drama between other workers becomes a headache at times. Those have been weeded out. Other than that I love my job Benefits from day 1 12 hour shifts Just a job Just a job, our team and team lead was amazing. Compensation was super low for California and not balanced for others in other states. Everyone gets the same percentage of raise no matter of performance. Overall Benefits are truly great with the company. PTO and holidays are as well. Full time employees only. No micromanaging unless they feel as if it is needed based upon your actions and production. Most managers are truly understanding as long as you communicate with them often and 'keep them in the loop. Great place to work Very nice place to work. Strict attendance rules but that's just how life is because people don't want to show up for work anymore. I advanced to a full time position very quickly. Great place for a career I have been with BD for 35 years, I have been given the opportunity to do many different jobs which has impacted both the company and myself positively. It is a very large company It is a very large company Good working environment They give u overtime , you need to wear gowns work in cold area , lot of time you need to pick heavy box for women very hard when on ur day you have to get change Less pay Can be great - depending on job and location Depending on the job and location it can be great, or less than wonderful. Like most places I guess. First job was so stressful and out of touch I quit twice. My manager got me to stay and worked it out for me to demote to a job I like SO much better. Very little support for new managers from company itself. Lot of leadership changes and came under micromanager, thankfully they left before I did and was later able to promote out. Benefits are overall good to very good, reasonable for US vacation. Highly restricted IT and company overall is very siloed -- pay is very good. Personally think company should post all openings and not just 'touch' some folks on the shoulder who are seemingly 'friends' with frequent promotions benefits, covid response was amazing, work for home, a lot of great coworkers Cigna insurance (limited in my area), some micromanagers, closeted promotions, turnover, training my boss (twice) Productive family oriented place to work, with endless opportunities. Loved working there great co-workers, great management team. Associates safety and well-being always came first. Simple job that vastly benefits the common welfare of the public. Plenty of associate incentives to strive for that any associate can benefit from. Profit sharing, work luncheons Short hours I liked that they were good about trying to really help patients. The pay was horrible and lots of favoritism. Manager would have favorites and let them get away with everything and grossly under pay people with more experience and knowledge. Tried to help patients Horrible pay, grossly underpaid for what was expected. No guidance from management and no communication..... Frequent layoffs, Management does not care. BD frequently has mass layoffs and reorganization. It’s hard to feel like you job is safe or protected. Management doesn’t really care about the employees. There is no support. Employees are overworked and overwhelmed. Huge lack of training. Working a 12 hour shift pattern which overlapped three other shifts I had multiple people training me so there was no continuity. I think with the right training BD would be a good prospect .Because the training is poor they have a large turnover of agency staff. Therefore I could not fully learn the interties of the roll I was expected to do. Reasonable pay and conditions The people I worked with were pleasant enough. Unable to park in factory car park because so many people working there now, had to park out on main road. Training inadequate. BD is one of the best! The location was Columbus Nebraska, MDS division. It’s a high volume and efficiency manufacturer of single use medical products. Great people to work with. Proprietary manufacturing technology. 3 Alot of work. No career advancement. Toxic environment. Loved the job. No advancement. No support from management. They care more about their public image than the employees. Alot of bullies in a toxic environment. 2 Decent pay Management is all about getting rid of anyone who questioned anything. If you have someone complain about you they will fire you without looking into the issues. 12 hour shifts Horrible Managers I work with extremely smart people that are passionate about what they do in the healthcare industry and it truly says a lot about their character. I love my job because I learn something new everyday. The teams I work with are under the same stressors and somehow we make it out with laughter AND WITH THE JOB DONE! :) We have a very positive work environment that keeps me going and I have a very great supportive manager as well. Good Pay Remote Work Lots of Work to be done Great Management Quite a bit of turnover Excellent company Excellent Company. Management and workplace culture is enjoyable. I highly recommend BD to all people looking for a career. But be ready to work graveyard shift. If you're not ready to work the nightshift, do not apply. It will take time to transfer to the dayshift. In my opinion it will be longer than a year. The work enviroment has a sense of comfort. A typical day at work normally would be consistent production throughout the shift and i may on occasion find different ways to increase my productivity,I've worked under better management but overall they're very reasonable with being considerate of employees needs and circumstances and the most difficult part of the job to me personally is the preparation to come to work because of my long-distant commute.What i enjoy the most are the wonderful people that i have the pleasure of working with. Having a 3-day weekend off Short-notices announcements concerning mandatory overtime. Great work / life balance, excellent pay and benefits, management listens, co-workers are friendly, limited growth opportunities Excellent pay and benefits, great work / life balance, co-workers are friendly and respectful, management listens to people’s concerns. Growth opportunities are limited, management sometimes tend to not focus fully on the most important priorities Excellent pay and benefits, great work / life balance, co-workers are friendly and respectful, management listens to people’s concerns. Growth opportunities are limited, management sometimes tend to not focus fully on the most important priorities Great Company but no many opportunities to become permanent. as a temp less opportunity to become permanent. the culture is ok. the hardest part was the commute. Friendly atmosphere. Manager was very professional. Free lunches and presentations long walk Bad training strategies Management allows bad Training from employees that don't want train new employees. Management has no flexibility for employees. Employees cause issues with no accountability. Coffee and Bagels during quarterly meetings Management Pay is not that great They could pay better, not competitive in pay. The company is a good company as a whole but there are not always chances for promotion which is why some people leave. Good company. Work life balance Good company. Work life balance. Good team, big responsibility and fast pace. Daily role meeting, reviewing mrp, forecast, demand. Skill required sap. Poor leadership Long term prospects not looking so good at BD. The only growth is coming from acquisitions which is unsustainable. Had to spin off diabetes care bc BD couldn’t figure out what they are doing. Work is good except for poor lead skills. I am a contract worker, who was informed that it could lead to permanent status. At almost a year this has not happened. I have had no complaints about my work, but have seen employees hired after me made permanent. Had a good lead, but they were moved to another department New lead tries to use threats, yelling and intimidation as work motivation to get work done faster with no idea of what work is needed to get job done. Needs management training. Needed tools are not supplied. Most co-workers are nice to work with. Pay is good Quality of work is does not matter, only quantity, No reasons are given why you are not made permanent employee, even with good quality work. Certain ethnic groups are only made permanent, Reverse discrimination is rampant, Management needs to be more aware of how leads/supervisors treat workers. It’s okay I do not love working here. The people are very corporate. Never chill. Stressful constantly. Makes my life awful. I never catch a break from these people. Bad Management. Language Barrier It's really hard to communicate in this company mainly because of language barrier and poor listening skills of the upper management. Management likes to blame employees. No accountability. None. Go somewhere else Blaming, yelling at employees, bad training, slow growth Great think less job poor management, turnover is terrible management has the wrong approach. Favoritism drama and gossiping is frequent at this job and is very much tolerated by supervisors and managers. A real sad place to start a career at!! Easy to get hired, because of the desperation of need for employees Drama farm from management to lowest on the totem pole Really bad work mentality There's so much in detail I could describe how little they care about there staff but ill hold those comments incase it comes back to bite me. It's byound toxic and no one will care about you cause you're replaceable Good pay, long hours Manatory overtime with no time off, manement will yell at your face, everyone whos trying to keep there job will purposefully try to get you fired. Toxic Good experience for a short term contract No complaints. Good experience for entry level information technology. Our direct supervisor was a very professional and understanding person. Experience gained It ended at six months (contract position) High Quality Company, Good Culture Good people, financially conservative company that delivers critical healthcare products and is a reliable business. Not the most innovative but getting better. Not the easiest place to work. Pros: Compensation is good. Lots of room for advancement. Cons: 0 work life balance Minimal support from management. Unreasonable expectations Lack of staff Lack of talent Lack of support Culture of production over all else. Fast paced & fun A lot of great people & managers at BD. I felt the hours, pay & benefits were fantastic! I never wanted to leave but I had to care for my mother so my time was cut way too short. Lots of perks & continued training & advancement opportunities Need more QA"
Phoenix Contact|" Excellent Quality is good everything is organized and people are so nice management are good to help it’s just a good place to work for good luck if you get a position out there 1 Very easy and chill job Everyone is nice there and the job is super easy a kid could do it. They also pay good and you can move up in the job quickly. All in all a good place to work 1 product and fun and comfortable place to work great company best places to find yourself and build your live nice place clean respect the nature. if you want to be happy come to Phoenix Contact if yiu want good benefits come to Phoenix Contact we work like a big family 1 2 Good place to work Nice corporate culture, great flexibility and excellent work-life balance. It may vary by department but my immediate supervisor is very friendly and supportive in every possible way. Low turn-over rate which makes your day to day work less of a challenge because you work in an environment and with people that you are very familiar with. Overall, a great place to work. Horrible If you're American you will be treated HORRIBLY. Their employees are rude and harassed me for the entire time I was there. I switched my job to help them and they still treated me horrible. They have more non employees than employees and new people can't get overtime. People have been waiting five years and more just to be hired on. there's no holiday pay or any extra pay at all. Worst place ever, biggest waste of my time Free food Employees, management, leads are all rude and don't train Great experience as an intern As an intern, I had many ""Real-world"" responsibilities and projects to take on. I felt like an actual employee. As a company, Phoenix Contact USA has an excellent culture. I felt valued as an employee and could get help whenever necessary. I highly recommend working/interning here if given the opportunity. Management, company culture, clean office, great people to work with Pay as an intern is relatively low Amazing life-work balance, International Opportunities, Struggling Management President of the company is extremely charismatic, open to ideas, makes decisions, and interacts with all employees regardless of position. Company provides limitless opportunities to truly learn the basics to advanced knowledge of diverse product lines and sectors of business. Life-work balance is second to none for support operations. Opportunities to gain international experience/exposure to big business. Can trust most of management, excluding Head of HR. Training Dept is very focused, and active, providing meaningful/useful training sessions and opportunities to grow in your profession. Some of the most technically sound engineering staff with a wide range of experiences in automation and production. Facility is immaculate and state of the art in every aspect, with an incredible automated logistics and distribution center. Relatively competitive salary, but lower than competitors in the area, however, the medical and dental benefits are again second to none. Some senior management struggle to follow through on promises, and have poor communication with employees. Opportunities to Learn, International Exposure, Innovation, Facilities Certain Management Interactions and Trust by Employees, Management Communication Not good place to work- deceiving culture I wouldn’t recommend it, but it was an interesting experience. Unless you agree and follow with any company nonsense, unethical policies and have no voice to express your own opinion, you don’t matter there and they get rid of you. Not worse pay for do what you told and don’t have your own opinion Fake leader-employee interactions, very deceiving Great place to work, incredible staff and awesome experience I was an intern at Phoenix Contact for 9 months. I worked with some incredible professionals that helped me whenever I needed it and really felt like I learned a lot from them. I would definitely recommend working for this company! Engaging and interactive work environment The workplace culture is very advanced with an on site wellness doctor and monthly meetings on personal development. There is also a cafeteria and gym at headquarters. Gym and cafeteria work life balance Work is easy. When hired you are employed by a temp agency until a permanent job comes up and that maybe for years and you get no benefits or holidays paid. They do not look at your past experience you start as one who never did that kind of work but the jobs are easy (no brainer) and the time spent as a temp worker is not counted as time when you become a permanent worker. Fairly relaxed enviroment I would say that working for them isnt bad but if you want more then you will have to look else where. If you're a temp you may find it difficult to get hired on permanent. Otherwise it's a good place to work. Stable, growing company This is a stable company that is growing. There is much emphasis on employees and collaboration across teams. Most management is genuinely interested in ensuring career growth for their teams. Horrible Management My experience at PC was that they enabled the worst in management to thrive. People worked behind the scenes scheming against their bosses to take their jobs and this was encouraged by mgmt. Clean offices Cannot trust anyone, especially mgmt. Unfair work balance between equal emplyees Bullying at the workplace was common in several departments, but not all. Management was part of the problem. Great company if you are in the right department. A Good Company A global company that believes in investing in their employees and continues to give back to the community. A company that leads the market in terminal blocks and has a loyal and strong customer base. Fun very good place to work there is always a lot of work. They don't really care for mistakes as long as you learned from them and don't let it become a habit. easy going Fun Environment with Close-Knit Employees and a Mission Driven Focus PXC is a well organized company with great employees and lots of benefits. There are constantly classes and events for employees which are free. They strive to immerse new employees to various departments to find their best fit. Wage compensation is below average, however. Events, benefits, employee atmosphere Compensation/Salary Team environment, great atmosphere and management support Working at Phoenix Contact was a source of pride. An innovative leader in products and solutions in the electronic engineering industry. Research and development as crucial, and they contribute to sustainable development. Employee focused with emphasis on positive creativity and infectious enthusiasm. Great cafeteria, benefits, and competitive pay Promotions from within are competitive Productive and Great Experience The typical day starts off by walking through the glass doors and you see everyone smiling. Approaching your desk you are greeted by mostly every person in passing. The people you work with and the culture you experience is much more important than most people believe. Quality internship experience Company culture, and overall experience is exceptional. Learned more at this company than I could have ever expected. Employees encourage and promote all to thrive within. Excellent Quality is good everything is organized and people are so nice management are good to help it’s just a good place to work for good luck if you get a position out there 1 Solid mid-sized company Private company that's in it for the long haul. Treat their employees very fairly and continue to innovate in their space. The biggest drawback is the location in Harrisburg, PA. Culture, leadership, innovations Location, pay 3 Wonderful Company As a sales engineer the company provided everything you could need. Great benefits, wonderful leadership (loved my bosses). Great internal staff to support us outside guys! Privately held company base pay not as great as other larger companies 3 Awesome Company World recommend working for Phoenix 100%. They have a lot of options for employees like picnics in the summer, a healthy cafe and various team building events throughout the year. cafe advancement opportunities Phoenix contact Foundation was excellent implantation left more to desire. Management had no follow throw and HR department was a joke.HR had not corrective actions on complaints. Supervisor was more into befriending associates then a leader. Best company I've worked for Very collaborative environment, definitely a team-oriented company. They do go the extra mile to facilitate the needs of their employees via an on-site gym and trainers to assist with health goals not to mention a healthcare facility and cafeteria with fresh options on site. Healthcare premiums are very affordable. There's always a friendly, helpful atmosphere and even when the workload gets heavy, they do show appreciation through end of the month festivities like catered lunch and snacks. We get plenty of paid days off especially with the end of year shut down. The company makes good, quality products so it's easy to stand by them as a support specialist. The most impressive thing about the company is that I've never met anyone there that was unhappy with their job. Pay, time off, company culture, quality products Not enough national locations Productive, fun place to work with gym. I loved it there. Clean and beautiful. Kind and wonderful people. Temps have a long wait for hire but worth the wait. Temps are treated as good as the hired when it comes to activities It was a pleasure to work there. Cafeteria with hot meals, gym, walking trails and lots more. Great Working Place Awesome place to work. Relaxed atmosphere but that doesn't hinder the job being done. Great people. Theres a gym in the office and a cafe with awesome food there. The food is not free but it is very subsidized. Gym, in-office cafe. Fun and well compensated.Fun working with mangement Customer developments,Build relationships,Product training.Understand new Products(Electronics) Most enjoyable work was being part of the customers success because if they were successful I got more sales. Enjoyable workplace:People,Sales Achievements,rewards,Challenge of New products,Competition..... My biggest regret was that I should have joined Phoenix Contact earlier in my career. Relationships Long hours Outstanding place to work I was only in an internship for Phoenix Contact, but really wanted a full-time position within the ranks. Nothing available, but if anything shows up, I'm going for it! Wonderful place to work! Healthy culture, excellent benefits, and the ability to work around one's schedule. benefits, culture, fitness center, healthy food cafe, flexible schedule, etc. nothing clean and bright. friendly The company is a non-smoking facility. the company is all about the health of the employees, doing stretching exercises twice a day. working in DC Automation, depending on the operation of the machine, it could be easy or quite stressful. Great Place to work There are many great perks to working here. They are a growing company. They have a good benefits package for their employees This a privately owned company, Fitness room, cafe for employees Great Place to work! Typical day, show up, smiles on nearly every face. Management is usually friendly and fair. Most people are friendly across departments. Hardest part of the job is staying awake after lunch from the on site cafeteria. A good employer This is a solid company as an employer and conducts itself with highest of character. The work varies based on the challenges at hand and chances for advancement abound. Good professional challenges Travel can get extensive I loved this job because it was what i went to school to do. I loved working here until management wanted to replace me with cheaper labor. I received various certifications and training that was pertinent to do my job. management management was amazing, kept tasks interesting and challenging to make for an excellent learning experience. Would recommend this job to anyone interested in learning about contracts. a lot of leeway not a ton of guidance Bunch of jokers in higher management This company hires temps and keep as a slave for many years instead of hiring and the bunch of jokers sitting in management just enjoy their position Cant work long time as a temp because your future is dark and work without raises and pay for long time. Worst management Nothing poor pay Upper level management typical of most companies - look out for themselves Commonly known HR cannot be trusted -company/manager first - employee last Pay is low Company Values and Culture are written and spoken only - not practiced except when it is for benefit of company Except in sales area, Advancement is low Most co - workers are great good balance between job and home life co-workers, work and home balance Upper Level Management, HR not trusted, low pay Absolutely Great Work Environment Never been at a place of work where every single person was always in as good a mood as Phoenix Contact and I doubt I will ever find one that competes. Overall good place to work This is an overall good place to work. You have job security, but the workload is light with little room for promotion and job advancement. good work life balance boring days A great company to work for. I was the 2nd shift AS/RS technician at Phoenix. As far as the company itself goes, it was a great company with a great atmosphere. Friendly co-workers (for the most part) and great benefits. I would recommend this company to anyone looking to pursue employment. Excellent Quality is good everything is organized and people are so nice management are good to help it’s just a good place to work for good luck if you get a position out there 1 Good place to work. Friendly management team. Work schedule is flexible. Good work/life balance. Job culture is very positive and upbeat. Office environment is relaxed, yet serious and our team works very well together. 1 Great place to work, they care! My typical day is trying to accomplish and give the very best I can, and what I have learned is, diversity is essential in the workplace. Management really cares about the employees well being and their safety. Super health conscious and do a lot to inform all who participate. My co-workers are super friendly with the same goals and we communicate well. The hardest part of my job is maintaining and relieving workplace stress in a positive way. The most enjoyable part is they do everything to accommodate and care for us, it is also enjoyable to know we are in a field with excellent growth with a super team of innovative engineers. Summer cookouts, cafateria week off paid year end break n/a 5 2 great environment , great people great people and very helpful co workers, very clean and great keep with the machines, hardest part is usually doing repetitive jobs, gym too strict on small rules Productive and fun Great work experience. I was able to work side-by-side with senior engineers and assist them developing, testing, and troubleshooting electronic devices. I also was able to continue my internship in Germany. During my time I helped research Pulse Width Modulation circuits so they can use it for future products. Very nice working atmosphere The working atmosphere was extremely nice. The coworkers, management, and President are all great people who care about you personally and are willing to help you out. The campus has a nice outdoor track and a nice weight room and workout facility. The cafeteria has great food as well. There are constant fun events going on during the summer with great food and fun games. Work environment, good cafeteria, training courses Good Company to work for Overall the company is a great company to work for. A relaxed work environment that provides a good work life balance. Good benefits, Good work/life balance, mediocre pay Career Progression for young professionals not in sales or engineering. busy working environment, approx receive 40 phone calls from customer very busy working environment, learn product knowledge and how to deal with customer, hardest part of this job is customer question the delay of the supplied we don't know how to answer them. the most enjoyable of this job is you help the customers fix the problems and them very happy. n/a a typical day at work what you learned management your co-workers the hardest part of the job the most enjoyable part of the job n/a n/a good mnc compnay all are good. good management. good employee of all company highly positivist Productive and fun workplace.

It may vary by department but my immediate supervisor is very friendly and supportive in every possible way. Low turn-over rate which makes your day to day work less of a challenge because you work in an environment and with people that you are very familiar with. Overall, a great place to work. Horrible If you're American you will be treated HORRIBLY. Their employees are rude and harassed me for the entire time I was there. I switched my job to help them and they still treated me horrible. They have more non employees than employees and new people can't get overtime. People have been waiting five years and more just to be hired on. there's no holiday pay or any extra pay at all. Worst place ever, biggest waste of my time Free food Employees, management, leads are all rude and don't train Great experience as an intern As an intern, I had many ""Real-world"" responsibilities and projects to take on. I felt like an actual employee. As a company, Phoenix Contact USA has an excellent culture. I felt valued as an employee and could get help whenever necessary. I highly recommend working/interning here if given the opportunity. Management, company culture, clean office, great people to work with Pay as an intern is relatively low Amazing life-work balance, International Opportunities, Struggling Management President of the company is extremely charismatic, open to ideas, makes decisions, and interacts with all employees regardless of position.

Not worse pay for do what you told and don’t have your own opinion Fake leader-employee interactions, very deceiving Great place to work, incredible staff and awesome experience I was an intern at Phoenix Contact for 9 months. I worked with some incredible professionals that helped me whenever I needed it and really felt like I learned a lot from them. I would definitely recommend working for this company!

When hired you are employed by a temp agency until a permanent job comes up and that maybe for years and you get no benefits or holidays paid. They do not look at your past experience you start as one who never did that kind of work but the jobs are easy (no brainer) and the time spent as a temp worker is not counted as time when you become a permanent worker. Fairly relaxed enviroment I would say that working for them isnt bad but if you want more then you will have to look else where. If you're a temp you may find it difficult to get hired on permanent. Otherwise it's a good place to work. Stable, growing company This is a stable company that is growing. There is much emphasis on employees and collaboration across teams. Most management is genuinely interested in ensuring career growth for their teams. Horrible Management My experience at PC was that they enabled the worst in management to thrive. People worked behind the scenes scheming against their bosses to take their jobs and this was encouraged by mgmt. Clean offices Cannot trust anyone, especially mgmt.

Epic|" Great comp, benefits, advancement - at a price. Epic pays its employees well and offers fair/above average health benefits and advancement opportunities at the cost of employee mental health, work/life balance, and flexibility. Upper management and CEO completely inflexible and inconsiderate to constant feedback during pandemic to increase WFH flexibility and expanding employee resources to provide accommodations for health of familial circumstances. Culture is very toxic, promoting overwork without compensation changes or reduction of other responsibilities. It is a shame because employees are generally sharp and humble people, and the mission of the company is a good one. If you value remote work flexibility, work/life balance, and a management structure that enacts change + advocates for the well being of its employees, Epic is not the right fit for you. 2 Limited room for growth and insane onboarding One thing about Epic that people should know going in, especially young professionals hoping to make friends at work, is that Epic makes it really hard to do so by absolutely overloading you during the onboarding process. In addition, once you actually have time to chat with people, work becomes your top priority. You are expected to log time down to the 15 minute interval, and lunch does not count towards your minimum 8 hours a day. The expectation is that you put more than 40 hours a week into work. It is clear that some positions at the company are viewed as more important than others (this is reflected in your pay). The interview process was a convoluted mess, and I was switched into a role with significantly lower pay near the end of the process. With the average tenure of employees only being around 3 years, it makes sense that I just got here and I am already thinking of leaving. If people can't see a future there for more than 3 years, then there probably isn't a future for me here either. 1 Software Developer Intern The internship is done in three stages, Design, Development, and Testing (somewhat). The duration of these is split up into 3-4 weeks periods that all interns normally hit. Pretty terrible management! Pay is good, everything else is terrible. Everyone works overtime. I think the management is greedy with these huge piles of money they're making and , it seems, not giving much of anything back to the community! Any other big tech company. You get what you’d expect from a constantly growing 12000+ employee company in tech. Epic will give you: 1) A decent (QM) to good (TS, IS, SD) salary 2) Some experience for your resume right out of college 3) Stability, and good benefits But they will also: 1) Expect you to be available for beyond standard hours pretty consistently 2) Give no flexibility on being in the office because they spend so much money building all these offices so why would they give WFH to long-standing (or any) employees? 3) Refuse to deal with a significant turnover rate issue which stresses current employees to the max 4) Not give many opportunities for significant advancement aside from becoming a Team Lead or switching teams/roles Ultimately, some people swear by Epic and buy into the culture, so it’s up to you if the pros outweigh the cons. But seriously consider, if you can, taking more time to search elsewhere and understanding if this is a job you’re willing to take on. Good food, (95%) good coworkers, events/clubs for employees Will work you as much as you let them, your opinions don’t matter, you’re just another dog in their machine Alright for the First Job Out of College Pros: - Many young people straight out of college, which generates a youthful atmosphere. - Campus is nice-looking. - Cafeteria with good food. - Pay is good. Cons: - Few people stay for long (more than three years), at least in my role. - Work-life balance is not very good. Generally, more and more tasks are shoved into you. - My manager doesn't seem to care much about my side of the argument. He seems to trust every tattle-taler over me. - Very few transferable skills other than working with customers (which is very frequent). Epic Good place to work while you look for another job. Cool campus and used to have good food, so I bet it will again. The software is really boring and the company sense of humor is corny and not in a good way. Maybe okay for a first job, but poor work life balance and burn out Epic's workforce is based mainly on hiring recent grads fresh out of college that are eager to get into the workforce and want to contribute. Many haven't developed the skills to set good work boundaries and feel pressured to work extra hours to keep up with the endless amount of work. Coworkers are great and the pay is good, but expect your coworkers to be constantly burnt out. They call it a software factory because management runs it like you're a factory worker Pros: Amazing pay, the best health insurance you will ever have, great food, and a good start to your career if you want to leave and pivot with the experience you have been trusted with. Despite the cons, it is an excellent career stepping stone. Cons: Incredibly old fashioned ideas about work that do not work well in a 21st century company. Especially a tech company. Not a lot of time off, laughably bad WFH - 5 full days a year, and it is difficult to trust management - they botched the COVID response by recklessly endangering lives pre-vaccine through trying to force a return to office until the local health department had to step in and stop them - and they consistently mislead employees to this day. Hemorrhaging tenured talent due to terrible management decisions, like limited WFH. The exodus of experience is causing extra work for all at the company who stay. They are trying to hire their way out of it but the tenured staff that knows stuff is leaving. Also, there's no real great culture at Epic. They really talk up the culture when you are interviewing, but the culture itself is barely there. You have people huddled in their offices all day not talking to each other. It is just not a fun company or environment once you get over the fun campus design. Instead of being a fun, bustling, culture-filled environment, it is instead the kind of place where you dread bumping into the person across the hall because you have never gotten to know them well since you are isolated in your window-less private office all day just punching in for your shift at the software factory. Pay, Benefits, Amazing Health Insurance, good stepping stone No WFH, workload, lack of culture, isolation in your private office, and management is the worst Come for the pay and benefits, stay for the non-compete Fun and challenging work at a cool campus with great food, pay and benefits. Coworkers are great, but management is out of touch and there is no transparency. They are so irrationally dedicated to on-site work only that they tried to bring everyone back to the office mid-pandemic, ignoring thousands of people's complaints and a public health order. They are chronically understaffed. Work/life balance is very difficult. Workload is unsustainable. Non-compete makes it hard to leave and find work elsewhere that leverages your skills and experience. Good starting job This job is a good starting job for when you come out of college since you get paid very well and you get pretty good training in the role you will be working in but its not the best work-life balance at time and no flexibility on work from home. Ok It's mostly fine, though there is a bit of a culture to really enjoy your work and work more than what is asked of you. I like to keep my work and personal life separate and this is a little bit harder to do. nice place cool place, a lot of training at the beginning. big community. decent pay considering the location. you might have to work with technology that isn't commonly used elsewhere. Good Job for just starting out of college It is a well paying job right out of college, but having no flexibility with remote work was definitely a turn off plus at times work was very stressful with the deadlines. Good job right out of college. No one stays long. Not a bad place to start off but not a good place to stay long term. They lure you in with the promise of sabbatical but barely anyone can last 5 years. Good pay No work from home Company is awesome, Managers could be better Having been trained by the owner of the company I knew what she wanted and how it should be done. She cared about people and growing them. New managers over the growth of the company did not share this idealism would play favorites and have their own goals in mind and not the companies. Do good and work hard and you are rewarded in a nut shell. Health Care cost were really low due to average age of company. Stocks. Self absorbed managers Epic has a great mission but terrible approach to treating employees Working at Epic was terrible personally, but I do know of people who genuinely enjoy or at least tolerate it. So here’s a fair assessment of what Epic does well: - Mission: Epic software is world class. While it is definitely not the most user-friendly, it is the entrenched market leader and that’s unlikely to change. Expect relative stability and no layoffs as a result. - Pay: There’s no denying a $65k starting salary for a job with no tech background required is pretty great. Many liberal arts, music, soft majors can get hired and excel. I know of several people who are very wealthy in their mid-20s because of Epic. IF you survive, though. - Hiring via tests over personality/connections: This is also a huge pro. Epic is entirely meritocratic in their hiring and this is quite admirable in theory. You work with co-workers who went to prestigious universities and state schools in Iowa; Epic doesn’t care. There are some consequences to that in some interesting personalities getting hired and becoming emotionally unintelligent TLs. - Training: Training focuses heavily on understanding the system. After a few weeks, you’ll emerge with several Epic certs for free that you can take elsewhere after the non-compete ends. - Colleagues: All my colleagues were smart. Business smart? Not really. But they were smart and could figure out problems. Any low performers are generally weeded out before even being extended an offer. Cons... Where do I even begin? Look up signs of a toxic workplace and compare it to your time at Epic. Think VERY carefully about the risk you are about Good salary, cheap COL, no experience needed Ridiculous hours, emotionally unintelligent management, random app assignment leads to potential chaos cool job on paper, extremely disappointing to work for TLDR: My experience with Epic was terrible but it’s more dependent on what work is being pushed on you. There are some great aspects to the job but many downsides as well. You should at least skim this for content important to you. Working at Epic may be one of the biggest risks in your career. They target enthusiastic college graduates to fill positions with many responsibilities and, what initially seems like, very rewarding compensation. The average Epic worker stays for 2 years. This is around the time most people realize their job takes more from you than it gives. Epic will overload you with work until you are burnt out. Once you leave, Epic will be of no help to you real quick. As an integration engineer (EDI), you may do 1. tech support (A.k.a. “TS” or “Technical Services”), 2. software implementation, 3. software development, and 4. miscellaneous internal ownership, all for interfaces and APIs. In my time there, I’ve had to do all 4 options. 1. The TS portion of the job may be hit or miss, depending on you you’re supporting and what other software they plan on integrating with. My customers put too much reliance on me, putting me in a permanent overwhelmed state. You will not travel to your TS customers; which makes up the majority of your customer base in case this was of interest to you. 2. The implementation portion was my most rewarding part. In this role, you help a hospital system implement Epic software for the first time. Unlike all other roles in the job, you can build directly in the customer’s to-be-implemented system. However, it requires the most effort great culunary team, good entry-level pay, some roles may allow travel terrible work/life balance, they don't care about you as an individual, little growth, risk in finding your career Toxic work environment I worked at Epic a few years ago. While there are a few perks of working at Epic, the negatives vastly outweigh them. This was my experience: During the hiring process, I only met with HR and other employees (and they're not necessarily the same people you're going to be working with). I learned who my TL/manager was on my first day. Though I worked hard and tried my best to be agreeable, my manager hated me for some reason. Needless to say, it's hard to be happy and successful at work when your own manager is unsupportive and has no sense of fairness and decency. I also had a couple backstabbing, two-faced coworkers who threw me under the bus for their own personal gain. Fun times. At any rate, I think people's experiences at Epic depend heavily on which team you're on and which TL you have. Nice and interesting campus, excellent food, free garage parking Work-life balance, lack of proper leadership CULTure is a problem They will give you as much work as they can unless you object. 55 hour work weeks are normal and if you end up working an 80 hour week nobody would even ask you if you needed assistance. Management's response to COVID was irresponsible -- it took anonymous employees going to the press media to have Epic reverse its decision to have us all come back into the office in Aug 2020 because "" we were losing out on our culture, big time"". Developers, QAer, TS, are all overworked. Food CULTure Little Support while Training; Cult-like Not much support during the training period after the initial ""classes."" Often very difficult to find anyone who had any time to answer questions so wasted a lot of time unsuccessfully trying to fix/solve things myself. Didn't really enjoy being herded into a massive auditorium every month with 10,000 other people, either. I understand that it was supposed to foster a feeling of unity, but I always felt like cattle. I also worried about what would happen if there was any kind of emergency in the room, as people wouldn't be able to get out quickly at all. The overall feel of the place was somewhat cult-ish to me. My personality wasn't a match for the company culture and I was very unhappy there. Interesting campus, cafeteria food was good Lack of support, cult-like feel, stressful Great comp, benefits, advancement - at a price. Epic pays its employees well and offers fair/above average health benefits and advancement opportunities at the cost of employee mental health, work/life balance, and flexibility. Upper management and CEO completely inflexible and inconsiderate to constant feedback during pandemic to increase WFH flexibility and expanding employee resources to provide accommodations for health of familial circumstances. Culture is very toxic, promoting overwork without compensation changes or reduction of other responsibilities. It is a shame because employees are generally sharp and humble people, and the mission of the company is a good one. If you value remote work flexibility, work/life balance, and a management structure that enacts change + advocates for the well being of its employees, Epic is not the right fit for you. 2 QA, Covid, and much more In QA, most of my time was spent just testing software which can be tedious but also rewarding if you are a very detail-oriented person. If you genuinely like to critique, you may like this job. At Epic, you will also be encouraged to seek out extra projects. Fair warning, you will likely be expected to still complete a full load of your main job like testing while also being expected to complete this project and they don't factor as much into pay. For QA, nearly all of your pay will be determined by how you rank compared to other QAers which means that if you work with a good developer you could make less than someone who is working just as hard and as well as you. You cannot talk to anyone about pay because it is against policy and there is not really a tangible department to talk to. In terms of Covid, work from home was strongly discouraged because it would affect the culture. Epic made the news and only after media push did it seem like policies got better. Seriously, check out Epic Covid response. Working there when covid started, I saw that lack of people working there/lack of resources resulted in a lot of development getting pushed back and that development that should have been fixed years ago ended up causing a lot of problems for customers when covid hit. Management did not push back unnecessary development with the influx of new needed covid development. Instead, they made it seem to us like we were to blame for it even when everyone (QA and Developers at the very least) were working insane hours. A lot of problems I had with my manager were that they Cool campus, green campus, mostly everyone is early twenties so you can find some friends You will be working more than 40 hours a week and way above if IS or TS, for QA there is little career advancement, cannot speak to anyone about pay 8 Challenging workplace in decline Working with customers can be challenging but fun Technical issues are interesting but specific to Epic software Exposed to a variety of responsibilities, from working with analyst teams, to brainstorming with executives, or leading initiatives for process changes Relatively flexible work schedule, as long as 40+ hours are logged every week Most colleagues are happy to help out, even when the customer isn't theirs Nature, quality and quantity of work is very application/manager specific Managers don't seem to hold power to change the day-to-day of their team members, decisions made at the top are absolute COVID response was abysmal and disappointing Great cafeteria, individual offices (1-2 people per room), challenging problems to solve, freedom to complete work or pursue professional interests, variety of tasks to complete Little PTO, relocation fee repayment if leaving w/in 2 years, non-compete (18 months now but can be extended at any time), pay and healthcare is good, but other benefits are mediocre at best, increasingly bureaucratic 11 Fulfilling work but unrealistic workload You do meaningful work and the pay is good, but there is high stress and workload that comes with your role that can unrealistic at times. The company's response to the COVID-19 pandemic has also been very poor, with resistance to WFH policies and repeated efforts to bring all staff back to campus when not necessary. Meaningful work, beautiful campus, good food, fun coworkers, great compensation Poor work-life balance, poor COVID response, large workload Entry level -- not meant for career (unless you lack a soul) The biggest concern is the gap between official policy and what is actually done. It is very disharmonious to be constantly guessing which way to go on anything. You are supposed to advocate for the customer, put yourself in their shoes etc, but management loved to leave you hanging as you are taking the fire for it. While the pay is decent, it isn't worth the stress at all. Additionally, the older the company gets, the more disconnected it gets with customers. The software is very expensive. At this point, they should be focusing on cost reductions. Healthcare costs continue to go up faster than inflation. You also have managers who get away with treating others on the team like dirt (like forcing you to cancel vacation plans and go to an install on the first flight out of Madison on a Saturday morning to pull an overnight shift that same night). your own office ridiculous work weeks, vacation, management Great start to a career Epic will make you work hard, but you will learn a lot, and get a head start on your peers. 5 years at Epic is worth 15 elsewhere. If you aren't afraid to work hard, think critically, and embrace success under independence, this job can be a good fit. Hit or Miss IT / Project Management job Depending on your app, role, and boss, this job can be very rewarding or somewhat demoralizing, very relaxed or somewhat overwhelming. Work load for me and many others regularly exceeded 60 hrs/wk with occasional weekends on call, but for some was typically 45-50 and relaxed. Fairly flat management structure means your boss will know and understand your job, but may not have many management skills. Typical day is spent making calls with analysts using Epic Software and troubleshooting code and implementation. Stay away from Clinical Documentation and Ambulatory roles if possible. Demanding but rewarding if you can see a project to completion It's a competitive environment with lots of people trying their best to stand out in a crowd. As a result, you'll get to work with a bunch of highly motivated individuals all eager to help out. On the flip side, I feel that if you want to achieve a good work-life balance it can be challenging - it will really force you to be a good manager of your self. Some times the job can seem overly bureaucratic too - tons of red tape that I've ran into here. But I suppose that's expected when you're working with health data. Overall, I'd say that it's a good place to work. You get pretty well compensated for what you do, and there are actual opportunities to make a difference at leading hospitals across the country. There's no other company like it. Epic has a campus of about 30 buildings, each one has its own theme and they are all connected by tunnels or indoor walkways of some kind, including the underground parking sufficient for more than what's needed by the 10,000 employees. The dress code is ""wear clothes when customers are on campus."" The work is intense and can sometimes require long hours but the culture inspires people to do just that. Fancy work place Working environment is very good. Epic has its own coding system. So the bar for the people which is not majored in Computer Science is not high. You will lean a lot about health care. This is a job, not a career. Epic will be the dead-end of your software development career. If you love the Madison area, want a high salary, don't care about learning the latest technologies, and can be a completely independent worker, then it can still be the perfect place for you. But if you're coming out of college and want to continue growing and advancing your career, then this is the worst place you could come to. They do not use recent technologies, the company does not have consistent management practices, and they don't encourage further education after your initial 6 month training. You won't have a team leader giving you feedback and helping you grow, just a boss checking on your deadlines. (*Some people are lucky and get great teams for awhile, but the vast majority of the people I know did not experience this and left within 1-3 years. Unfortunately, so many people get burnt out and leave the company that even if you have a great team for awhile, it's unlikely to stay that way.) Day to day work is bug fixing in your office alone. Epic is a culture of ""self-improvement"" and hidden requirements -- there are unspoken rating and algorithms being used to track you against other workers at the company, and you are expected to be your own motivator and trainer. Epic actively discourages employees from talking to one another about their performance or providing feedback to one another. You must be above average in every category every month within these background algorithms. If you're not, then the company will simply drag you along and get as much work out of you as they can before Great job out of school Epic was a great first job because it forces you to get organized if you want to succeed. Getting a good time management system was critical. They throw you right into the work and expect you to handle it. It forces you to learn quickly and could be quite stressful but makes you a better employee overall. The campus is beautiful and lunch is fantastic. Everyone looks out for each other and wants you to succeed. Independence Long hours, steep learning curve Highly productive. Culture and environment is incredible Highly productive work environment. Everyone truly cares about putting in high effort for their job. The campus is essentially an extension of college - many fun things to do, young employees, challenging work. Productive and exciting workplace, but with zero work/life balance Great company for people just graduating college, has a great atmosphere and amazing benefits. Not a good company for long term employment. Has an extremely bad work/live balance. Usually end up working long hours at work and then doing more work late at night at home and sometime even having to go back in office. This company hires in reaction to need so your team is always extremely understaffed. Amazing benefits, great work place (your own or shared office), amazing and cheap food horrible work/live balance High expectations, potential for fun, great experience Epic is a place with high expectations of their employees with great reward. Opportunity to work with some of the most amazing people all around the world. Paid very well but very stressful They hire a lot of engineers for the TS role, so they pay very well but the hours are long and you are expected to pick up everything as fast as possible. Overall most people I was hired in with left within a year. Good travel benefits, amazing dining halls, young workplace. Long hours, very stressful, shaky management. Productive Environment with Long Hours Long hours but you will grow your knowledge on healthcare and project management immensely. I would reccomend if you are looking for a challenging workplace Stressful and Difficult This job is a good opportunity for kids fresh out of college to have a lot of responsibility, and have the opportunity to shine early. Sadly, a lack of training, and oftentimes poor scheduling and budgeting for projects can leave the Epic team overloaded with work, and thus leads to high turnover. Fun culture but poor work-life balance The majority of the day is spent on customer interactions ranging from basic tech support to advance troubleshooting. The management structure is very flat and you are generally in charge of managing your own work. The campus is very nice and Epic has a very good culinary team that serves lunch every day. Work life balance is poor, you are frequently on call or working late, and travelling can often take up portions of your weekend. Fun place to work The work I did at Epic was challenging and enriching. There is a steep learning curve, but the work is rewarding and well compensated. I would recommend Epic to anyone looking to work hard in a fun environment. Terrible work life balance, management gets no formal training Terrible work life balance. Managers have no formal training and aren’t properly equipped to to foster growth within their employees. Great product. Great comp, benefits, advancement - at a price. Epic pays its employees well and offers fair/above average health benefits and advancement opportunities at the cost of employee mental health, work/life balance, and flexibility. Upper management and CEO completely inflexible and inconsiderate to constant feedback during pandemic to increase WFH flexibility and expanding employee resources to provide accommodations for health of familial circumstances. Culture is very toxic, promoting overwork without compensation changes or reduction of other responsibilities. It is a shame because employees are generally sharp and humble people, and the mission of the company is a good one. If you value remote work flexibility, work/life balance, and a management structure that enacts change + advocates for the well being of its employees, Epic is not the right fit for you. 2 Great people working hard to do the right thing, and having fun while doing it Working at Epic offers a lot of variety in your day-to-day and opportunity to have an impact in so many different ways. 1 Very serious company but likes to have fun. Epic they're changing the world for the better. By creating a stellar state of the art medical software they are improving patients' medical care across the world and saving lives. And for that they take what they do very seriously and can be very demanding at times. They place high expectations on you and expect a lot. But it's worth it cause we are helping people after all. And they do, do a lot to be silly and havre fun and create a generally positive environment and atmosphere on the premises and in everything we do. A total joy to work there. 1 2 Great Culture; Challenging Work Work life balance is very challenging if you're in the Implementation division, and travel is often higher than they'll tell you during an interview. A good deal of technical and computer science-related skills are required for Implementation, and if you don't like that, you won't last long. Your early success largely depends on which hospital organization and Epic manager you're assigned to. Most employees are great, but some are checked out. Long hours, unhappy workers Epic invests a lot in the infrastructure and perks in order to make the career bearable but the work life balance is tricky for many and the expectations set are often unfair to employees. Most employees in the PM job roles leave a after a short period of time. Training is disorganized and the management has no training in managing a team so career growth and support through HR related challenges is a hit or miss. beautiful campus, great coworkers company culture, environment Fun and engaging workplace that works you hard Epic has a fun campus filled with bright people. If you are ambitious and enjoy the work, you will do well. If you don't meet their high expectations, you may be worked out. All hinges on you It's not a bad place to work, but it all depends on whether or not you ""drink the kool-aid."" If you do, you could love it. I'm not in that camp, and it's pretty isolating which I did not like. Good first job, poor work-life balance I've learned a lot during my time at Epic, but the experience overall has been negative. Epic does not respect their employees time, and expects them to give over their lives to Epic to be successful. Good pay and benefits Poor work-life balance Great culture and mission, aggressive work/life balance expectation Epic is a sincere company with a strong, mission-driven corporate culture. Employees with a real passion for the healthcare IT field will do best as the company asks a lot of its employees. However, performance in the PM role has a lot to do with factors that are sometimes beyond one's own control (quality of customer counterparts, feedback coming mainly from one person), meaning job success has a certain element of luck. Those making it past the first year or so can expect extremely competitive raises but also potentially extreme hours and a very demanding travel schedule. An R&D shop For software developers, your team leader (direct manager) is another software developer. This has great benefits in being able to explain the complexities of a problem/system and propose realistic timelines to achieve milestones. Workplace culture isn't 'startup'-y as some promotional materials may imply, but processes are flexible and serve to make the product better (i.e., they don't just 'exist'). The opportunity to design directly with customers is invaluable – take advantage! The technical stack for most functional areas is limited but largely pliable. Regular work is done to improve developer tooling. Subsidized lunches, great campus, unbeatable healthcare Limited tech stack Great job, just not what I was looking for I worked as a Technical Problem Solver (TS) for about 6 months before leaving. The work environment and compensation are both wonderful, I just was not very interested in the work itself. You have to spend a lot of time working with customers and the problems that you solve mostly just require troubleshooting rather than reasoning from first principles. Food, Environment Not very interesting work Company Culture & Coworkers above all else Such a fun and creative environment. All my co-workers are incredibly intelligent and driven - I can count on them for anything. The work is meaningful and impactful and that drives what we do and how we do it. No work life balance Prepare to be overworked and undercompensated. Culture isn't great and there isn't a strong emphasis on personal advancement. A lot of disorganized processes. An EPIC career The people I worked with at Epic were some of the smartest, most dedicated individuals I have ever met, willing to go above and beyond to improve healthcare and to help our clients successfully achieve their goals. It is not an ""easy"" job and work/life balance can certainly be a challenge. But for me, it was absolutely a worthwhile and rewarding place to work. Stressful, but good for long term career opportunities Working at Epic is a great opportunity for young inexperienced people to launch a career in a booming industry, but it's also extremely stressful and demands sacrifices to work/life balance. Cool culture for an otherwise mundane job The best part of working for Epic were my coworkers and the company campus. Other than that, the job and management were pretty lackluster. There were a number of pointless meetings, but I never felt so encumbered with them that I couldn't get my actual job done. Culture, People Management Solid starting place It is a pretty good place to start your career in tech. The culture is alright, a little bit like a cult at some points. Though other starting people usually like to joke about it. The work you do depends heavily on the application you are assigned to. Busy You will be busy always if you work in the Implementation Division as an application coordinator or manager. The job involves a lot of travel, but it can be fun to rack up the points. They work you hard but give good benefits They really do their best to give you good benefits, but the nature of the work is that there will be points where they work you into the ground, and since it is salaried, you don't feel any compensation for the extra work you put in. benefits It's a great first job The IS division is a great first job as they sculpt you into the type of project manager that work best for IT implementations. There is a steep learning curve, but overall anyone can be successful at this job with hard work. Autonomy Epic gives you a great deal of freedom. You get your own office, control over your workday, great food and benefits. There is a poor work life balance. Great comp, benefits, advancement - at a price. Epic pays its employees well and offers fair/above average health benefits and advancement opportunities at the cost of employee mental health, work/life balance, and flexibility. Upper management and CEO completely inflexible and inconsiderate to constant feedback during pandemic to increase WFH flexibility and expanding employee resources to provide accommodations for health of familial circumstances. Culture is very toxic, promoting overwork without compensation changes or reduction of other responsibilities. It is a shame because employees are generally sharp and humble people, and the mission of the company is a good one. If you value remote work flexibility, work/life balance, and a management structure that enacts change + advocates for the well being of its employees, Epic is not the right fit for you. 2 Good company to work for, but detrimental to a career Epic is a good place to work overall. They pay well and the cost of living is cheap. The work life balance for developers isn't worse than other big companies (as far as I'm aware). They have good benefits. The biggest problem is career-wise. The job market is pretty bad in the Madison area, so you'll probably have to move. They use outdated tech that leaves you behind other people when it comes time to try applying elsewhere. Their development practices are equally far behind. They also require developers to provide in-person support to customers during go-lives, and have other weird requirements that aren't really beneficial to anyone. The campus is nice and they have actual offices for employees. The cafeterias are awesome. There aren't any ping pong tables, a gym, babysitting, or other amenities that a tech company that owns its own campus should have. Amazing subsidized lunches in cafeterias Requires travel, outdated tech 3 1 Heavy workload with trailing edge technology Salary and benefits are good but do not compensate for the horrible work. I was honestly surprised to hear people saying they had a social life. You will get in trouble if you spend less than 45 hours per week on the job. First thing that nobody will tell you is that you have to pass a series of exams before you get your quoted salary. They teach crash courses but you will still fail some of your exams. Passing all of them takes about 5-6 months. The management is a towering hierarchy of acronyms that quickly disappears out of sight. I once met my supervisor's supervisor but that was my entire personal interaction with management. Everyone is under a lot of stress so managers don't have time for casual interaction with workers. Software development is hard work. The programs are a spaghetti bowl of legacy work and each group modifies everyone else's code to get their own bug fixes done. Sometimes another person modifies a piece you worked on -- whoever got in the last change wins. Also anyone who has been around a long time knows how to get their way and tend to bully new employees. There are no system architects or overall software design documents. Each programmer makes architectural decisions on the spot. I only know a few people who lasted more than a few years there. I moved on to another company in the same field and was amazed at how much more productive I became almost instantly with a sane, modern code base and supportive work environment. Salary, benefits, good cafeteria Terrible legacy codebase, no work-life balance, obsolete technology 10 Pays well, long hours and does not provide useful skills My time at Epic was marred by a Team Leader who did not understand that everyone did not want to work 50-60 hour weeks every week and did not give direction when it was asked for. Many of the languages used are obsolete, and the tools used were primarily developed in house so they do not transfer over anywhere else and you had to spend time trying to figure out how their specific tools worked. It's a gamble to work at Epic An employee's experience at Epic is kind of a gamble, and will be dictated by the customers they are assigned and the team lead they report to. Many of the new hires are assigned new customers, and these customers can face some of the most challenging technical issues. This means a new hire that is getting acquainted with the software in their first year is responsible for rapid delivery on complex configuration issues. Colleagues are helpful, but often times unavailable to help truly dig into an issue. Team leads are often talented technical problem-solvers but they fail to understand the human element of management. Great culinary and cafeteria options, the software is interesting and great to use, colleagues are mostly nice and talented. team leads are inconsiderate and unsympathetic. Progressive organization Wonderful box of experiences working in this uniquely place organization in a flooded IT space for healthcare. Culture is good . There is good pressure of work but then a strong learning experience too. Solid Company for those willing to put in the work Good Company all around - they work you hard and try to make sure you are supported. Emphasis on feedback channels and relationships. Cool Campus, solid benefits. Benefits, cool campus, excellent work conditions long hours required Rollercoaster Amazing development opportunities for kids right out of college, but they give their employees too much work thus very poor work life balance. The culture of ""feedback"" (aka mostly for things you've done wrong) leaves much to be desired. Experience completely depends on your team, boss, and customers Your experience can be wonderful or miserable and it completely depends on your team (application and role), your boss, and the customers you work with (if in a customer facing role). Get good at saying no (and arguing your side) and don't take on too much. It's a young company which is fun and makes it easier to make friends. Everyone's really smart which is also a nice perk. Pay and benefits are good, but if your boss doesn't like you and ranks you low, your bonuses and raises will be lower just because of that. Overall I've seen a lot of poor management at Epic, but if you get lucky with management you may actually have a pretty good experience. Pay and benefits, young company, good first job, challenging Poor management, no work/life balance, care about customers more than employees Chaotic but Eventful Overall, Epic can be a rewarding experience for a lot of employees. It is a fast paced environment with a lot of opportunity for growth and recognition internally. It has an amazing campus with a lot of autonomy in the job. However, it can be very stressful and overwhelming to a lot of newcomers (most of the new hire classes are fresh out of college). The job isn't necessarily as difficult as it is never-endingly stressful. Lunch on-site, no formal dress code, great benefits Heavy travel, high stress situations, sink or swim mentality at times An adventure with all its twists and turns In two years I went from knowing very little about the medical industry to presenting on medical software to nurses, doctors, and hospital executives. Epic gives you hands on experiences with customers and gives you responsibilities that most companies would make you wait years for. I also at stretches worked 10-14 12-hour shifts in a row to support customers, traveled 80+ days out of the year, and stayed up late to meet deadlines. They have a strong internal culture with a wonderful campus and friendly, young, and helpful coworkers. They also expect volunteerism and a constant increase of responsibilities, internal and external. There are lots of pros and cons to Implementation at Epic, so it is up to each person to assign them weight. Hands-on experiences, beautiful campus, great cafeterias, coworkers, travel locations, compensation High expectations, frequency of travel, workload, little to no remote possibility Great place to start your career As most employees at Epic, I took this job as my first job out college. The compensation is competitive and you learn a lot. Transparency seems to be an issue though and the turnover rate is also an issue due to the long hours. A challenging and fun way to begin a career Working at Epic proved to be a valuable experience in my early professional life. I learned many business basics early on, because my background was in the arts. Their training is extensive. Depending on your role (and customer), you may travel a lot during your time there. This can teach lessons in work-life balance, but has the potential to be daunting for some. Great food, great growth for entry-level folks, interesting industry, beautiful campus Can be high stress, managers (in my experience) often had little experience Great pay The pay is very good and bonuses are way above the average in any other company / industry. It's common for employees to get 10%+ raises every year. The food is also great Bad work/life balance - Good compensation Working at epic is riddled in processes. The culture emphasizes a false sense of urgency as you're constantly juggling new ""top priorities."" You often have to make concession either in your time or quality of work as there is simply always too much stuff on your plate. Compensation is good but turnover at the company is very high due to the aforementioned poor work/life balance. Pay, health insurance, IT experience Maternity Leave, Work/life balance, low autonomy Exciting But Catty Environment The travel department was pretty catty. It was stressful to hear women constantly whispering about each other. Made it very hard to concentrate. Of course the opportunity to work at such an incredibly interesting place was great, it just became too much to have to deal with every day. Good Internal Environment Pro: my coworkers are always willing to help, and the company structure makes it very easy to reach people in different roles and at different levels. Con: Ironically, the same company structure can lead to competing projects and timelines. I was over worked very often and very easily when I forget to fight for my work life balance. Exciting and Challenging Epic is both an exciting and challenging place to work. Expect to be given plenty of responsibility right out of the gate with high expectations. There are tools in place to help out, but personal growth is desired. Epic promotes internally and you are rewarded with opportunities. Hard Work is Rewarded At Epic, you can where whatever you want, food is great and cheap, andthe campus is absolutely stunning, but you will work hard. The good news is that you are rewarded for your hard work. Incredible benefits, superb workspaces, but extremely negative atmosphere. The unavoidable pitfalls of working in a huge bureaucracy are, despite the company's attempts, magnified by the size of the faculty, and the fact that all employees work on one campus. I have experienced more Cronyism, backstabbing and throwing others under the bus in six years here than the other 26 years of my working life combined. Incredible insurance, 40 hours per week on a set schedule (you are never called in on your day off), tons of vacation, beautiful campus, on and on. Truly psychotic chefs have carved their way to the top, firing purges are common, creating a very stressful, cutthroat, and unfriendly atmosphere, in every kitchen I have worked, and I've worked in many, the staff tend to grow and appreciate each other through shared stress and labor, that process is sort of inverted at Epic. A mixed bag I owe much of my professional growth to Epic. They do a lot of things well, and their organizational philosophy (at least as stated) jives well with how I think a business should be run. However, those principles often seem to contradict the reality of how business is run there. As a large and young company, many people end up in leadership/management roles who should not be there. New employees often have to sink or swim, as your success depends heavily on mentors who often just went through their own first project and may or may not be ready to be a mentor/manager themselves. The team lead structure is not great either and your experience at Epic can be made or broken by your TL. In most cases you will never work with your TL, and the people who report feedback to your TL might never work with them either. This means your job evaluation is rarely done by people who have actually observed you doing your job. The ""wear the cape"" culture has a tendency to grind down smart, ambitious, and talented employees as well. The idea that no matter what the issues or complexities on the project, that you can solve it if you just dig a little deeper and work a little harder is completely and totally backwards. A friend in my hire class who was the most enthusiastic of all of us at the beginning left after only a year because she was drowning on a project, received no help from her Application Manager, and when requesting additional resources from management was told we need to ""wear the cape"". Epic can be a great place to work, or it can be thoroughly miserable and life-draining. Campus, food, travel opportunities, rapid professional growth Lack of support, corporate structures that did not scale to 10k employees, ""chew em up and spit em out"" mindset Great comp, benefits, advancement - at a price. Epic pays its employees well and offers fair/above average health benefits and advancement opportunities at the cost of employee mental health, work/life balance, and flexibility. Upper management and CEO completely inflexible and inconsiderate to constant feedback during pandemic to increase WFH flexibility and expanding employee resources to provide accommodations for health of familial circumstances. Culture is very toxic, promoting overwork without compensation changes or reduction of other responsibilities. It is a shame because employees are generally sharp and humble people, and the mission of the company is a good one. If you value remote work flexibility, work/life balance, and a management structure that enacts change + advocates for the well being of its employees, Epic is not the right fit for you. 2 Great job if you know what your limits are Overall, Epic is a great place for a QAer to work. They patiently train you in the technical side of things and encourage tester creativity. They will work you as much as you let them, so knowing how much you can handle and keeping a good work/life balance is really important. QA is generally appreciated by management and other roles, but is also often the first scapegoat when things go wrong. Casual work environment, culture of feedback Pressure to work long hours 4 2 Great pay, poor life Epic uses high salaries and a fancy campus to try and make you forget that you're working 60+ hours a week and actively exacerbating healthcare problems like physician burnout. 28 3 Slide There's a slide and a lot of cool archetecture to get lost in. Great place to work at a careers end in the culinary industry. Sometimes individual ambition and growth felt impeded. Great for new workers Pros: Solid compensation for entry level. Decent benefits. Robust and open culture of feedback -- your ideas are heard early on and often respected, at least relative to your tenure. Raises tend to be pretty good, 5-13% annually was my own experience. Cons: Work Life balance is a challenge. Luck of assignments leads to some people having very difficult times. Company is not always understanding about clients who are difficult. Advancement/Raises are a really opaque process with little input from you. Okay company for redundant software development The work is okay and the colleagues are super friendly, but adherence to outdated technology means that career advancement opportunities are next to nothing. Join if you like a quite life in a sub-urban city with great summers but horrendous winters. The canteen is indeed awesome Outdated work Decent compensation but insufferable corporate culture You get paid decently well, but management is poorly trained and communication is a nightmare. Everything is about the ""official process"", critical thinking often doesn't exist. The QA position is dull and repetitive. Internal training is often insufficient. What management claims are priorities in meetings and what you are pressured to prioritize behind closed doors are often different. There's no sense of prioritization. Everything is high priority all the time. The food is really good and the money is good for a first out of school job. Management is poorly trained, job is dull, internal communication is passive aggressive. A lot of stable busy work in the middle of Wisconsin They'll train you and pile on the work on you very fast. If you can get the hang of things quickly, learn to reach out, tolerate living in Wisconsin during the winter, increase your workweek by about an additional 10 hours on top of your usual 45 per week about a few months of the year, it can be a good place to work Pay is decent, smart people Winter, hard work, not great planned absence policy Staffs unprepared and young hires to clients There really should be more time devoted to training staff before throwing them on a customer. In the end both the employee and the customer suffers. Should allow for more training. Fun and young workplace I enjoyed working at Epic most of the time, though I was there when it was much smaller than today (not yet 1000 employees). When I was there, there were two classes of employees: people who had been doctors, medical professionals and other professionals who were brought in and then the lower class so to speak of recent grads who were churned through the epic mill and then left, exhausted, after two years. They hire high achievers and interesting people, though. I routinely bump into former Epic employees across the country and they are always bright and successful. Pay was pretty low for the ""lower class"" employees. They do have one cool ""sabbatical"" benefit that kicks in after you have been there for a few years. Fun atmosphere, fresh outlook, good benefits lack of management structure, very low pay for entry level Good environment, good people The environment is friendly and whimsical, the people are like minded and hard working. Upper management loses sight of how things are done in the trenches, often just telling you what they want but not how to do it nor specific enough to have a clear vision. Free lunch for Culinary, flexible schedule. unclear expectations, not very transparent of pay or how to advance your pay. Great place to start a career after college Collaborative work environment to improve user experience with medical software. The campus at Epic is beautiful. Employees here hit the ground running taking on projects after about two to three months of training. Good job, if you're a good fit for the culture Work in the technical services role varies widely dependent on your application and clients. ~45 hours/week is expected. More project management and less troubleshooting than you might expect. Hard, but Fantastic first job Prepare to learn a lot. Fantastic first job for pay and anonymity - especially if you want to go into the Healthcare field. Learn to say ""No"" when you have a full workload. Busy, Pay, Diverse work work/life balance, commute, relocation Nice perks, but little career advancement. I worked at Epic as ""Technical Services"". Basically, this means that you're a consultant on configuring, troubleshooting, and upgrading Epic software for 3 hospital systems (The particular software package and number of customers depends on your team). So the good: Epic hires good people, and by and large folks are helpful when you run into an issue. The pay is reasonable, and seems to be comparable to most engineering jobs out there. Your experience with customers varies widely for different people, but you are the ""expert-on-call"", which is cool. I had good relationships with my customer teams, so I enjoyed helping them. Finally, the campus is beautiful and the campus food is excellent. The bad: Epic doesn't really prepare you to do anything else. It's all software, so you won't be able to switch to a hardware type job. And the software skills are so company-specific that you won't be employable by anybody else either. Finally, Epic doesn't really have a big enough name-recognition profile to help you in that way. The main options post-Epic are working in hospital tech support or going back to school. This is a problem given the huge amount of turn-over. There's a reason why Epic is constantly hiring new people. The Verdict: Epic's a decent place, but is not going to contribute that much to your career. It's good if you need time to think about what you want to do with your life, if you want to apply for an MBA, or are willing to risk getting laid-off for the relative stability that comes after the 3 year mark. Otherwise, just go for that graduate degree you were Great Company to work for if you don't mind an average The work is very fast paced and demanding but the company provides several support network and tools to do the best. Customer is the focus and the company goes out of the way to ensure quality and do the right thing. Good healthcare plan, cafeteria, sabbatical, campus work-life balance and flat organization with little chance of title growth Good job, long hours You will learn a lot at Epic but your first year requires a large investment of time. Success at the company depends on the leadership skills of your manager. excellent compensation long hours Large organization trying to maintain its grassroots feel The experience working for the company can vary greatly depending on which department or role you have; as a traveling project manager the expectations are high, and they are looking for resilient, smart, flexible people who can solve problems without hand-holding. For internal administrative roles expectations are still high, but the culture is highly dependent on the direct leadership of that department. The CEO is still very involved in decision-making for the company and can be very particular with regard to the way information is presented to her or departments are run. It can be problematic since her expectations are often a moving target; individuals that work closely with her either learn to take it with a grain of salt or leave for better opportunities. Excellent campus and food, sabbatical, 2 weeks paid parental leave Ceo, lots of meetings Productive and conducive environment to offset lack of structure in work. Epic Systems has a great campus with an excellent work environment. However, the work that a TS has to do is rather unguided and all over the place. There are expectations that are not clear as well as hours that exceed the paygrade. Environment, cheap food on campus Lack of clarity, excessive expectations Hustle Bustle with low management You work with a lot of intelligent people. You constantly are learning and challenged. Beautiful campus and services offered. You could end up working 70+ hours a week for months straight. Feels like a college sometimes, and it does not seem many managers received the proper training. Training does not relate to the job much at all and you could be thrown on to two projects right away. Work life balance is tough There is a lot going for this company, but work life balance is difficult, especially for implementation staff who are constantly traveling. Can at times feel like a dog eat dog environment with little opportunities for growth. Amazing food, company culture, themed campus Long hours, extremely competitive, inexperienced managers"
Wizards of the Coast|" It is very much a game culture. They are very dedicated to their product and IP and making games folks will enjoy. The work/life balance is very good. You are able to participate in any game tests you desire. The company drives to make the customers wanting more of the products. Not kind to senior employees. Company seems to want to replace seniors with young ones always. Good place for young talented people who needs experience for step up for another company. If you are looking to build a career in a same company, I would not recommend. Productive and fun workplace Working for WOTC was the best job I have ever had. Unfortunately, I had to leave due to disability. The management was good, not micromanaging, and the people there are passionate about creating a product that elevates the customer experience. Work culture None` Christmas Layoffs...enough said. Under paid, though my direct management was wonderful. However, our team was broken up and outsourced, and they lay off 15% of their workforce every Christmas, so don't get attached. Nope. Uh-huh. Not great. Questionable culture. Used to be great but now is all about the bottom line. Have lost sight of what used to make them great for their customers. Best place I have ever worked at. This is by far the best place I have ever worked at in my entire life would recommend anyone who is thinking to apply here. The work days are fun. The employees are actually the best people ever and everyday is just enjoyable. Fantastic Workplace with Great Culture Let me preface this by saying I was only a Contractor at Wizards of the Coast. As such, i didn't receive certain benefits that employees would receive. However during my time there, I learned a lot about call center practices and procedures, product knowledge, and much needed experience. Competitive, Low Compensation but Great People and Products Was brought on as a contractor through a 3rd party agency called Tapfin. I applied to numerous positions for permanent work, however it's a very sought after workplace and potential employees are willing to take a pay cut and a demotion to work there. This makes it very difficult for anyone else trying to break into the workplace. Very competitive. While at Wizards of the Coast, it was a great place to work with loads of awesome people. Can't say enough about how amazing the people are. I enjoyed being there even if some of the work was tedious and mind-numbing at times. While I didn't like the repetition of the work I was doing I loved being there. As a contractor, it's a great place to work if you want the experience and are looking to get a foot in the door but you should know that chances of you staying there are very VERY slim. Plus pay is not enough to live on in the Greater Seattle area, especially if taking benefits. Good company, but knows you want to work there. They know every person wants to work there. Pay will take a hit because they can fill the seats without a problem. However it is also a great place to work for, people are very passionate about the work they do and the things they create there, so everything comes out with love. Looks awesome on resume, everyone in games knows Magic the Gathering. No real chance for movement up, management can be slow to respond to things. Lots of changes. My second week there, there was a huge corporate restructure. Process fell apart and this was in addition to learning a new job and culture. It made doing creative work extra difficult. Luckily, it looks like there are some changes happening and I would love another opportunity to work there in the future to see how that change has taken root. Really fun and engaging work. Making high-fantasy design is really fun. Culture was a little icy. Some really dumb corporate practices. Back in The Day... There was a day when WotC was a fun, supportive, adventurous place to work, but it is not this day. Several years ago the company started recruiting managers from outside the company. Not inherently negative but it did impact the culture of creativity, exploration and experimentation. The drive from senior leadership (if you could call it that) was to take the slack out of the schedules and hit delivery dates 'or else.' Once again, not a negative itself but it was joined with yearly reorganizations followed by layoffs. It was so common the employees would ascertain the exact date of the layoff before it was announced (winner of the pool didn't have to buy the first round). Over time, the number of people doing the actual work has decreased as the number of deliverable assets, game releases and components continues to climb. Overtime is expected and if you're not doing it, you're not a team player. If you speak to members of another team with anything but the utmost in reverence, you're not a team player. If you explain to an internal customer that you can't do something because there are other jobs already in progress or there aren't enough hours in the day to include their request, you're not a team player. If you don't do exactly as you're told ... well, you probably see the pattern here. There is an obvious culture of favoritism in the company today. Certain teams and departments continually receive budget, functional freedom, headcount, and legitimate consideration for their ideas. The rest are on their own. There's a 'Lord of the Flies' vibe for everyone other Free sodas, free gym on-site, free product for FTEs. Pay/salaries, career growth, professional growth, expectation of overtime, I could go on Massive culture change with new management in 2017 Things have changed with new management. They are betting the farm on getting becoming a digital game studio, and sucking the soul out of what used to be a pretty fun place to work. Free soda, free MTG product Was great but now... WotC was a great place to work but with the new management, some people in some departments are suffering due to their ignorance and I do love the games and the cards, however. They are piece of art that no other company can come close to. You do have opportunities to learn if you desire so. It's really up to you how to make your career at this place as long as you are contributing to the company. I guess that's always the case at any company. Free products as FTE. Good work & life balance. New management cares less fun place to work WotC is a fun place to work as it is a gaming company. There are usually lots of opportunities to advance and move onto various teams if you network and keep your eyes open. It's fun being a Wizard There is lots of free product, free food, and good conversation in the building. However, everyone works hard as well. There is a good collaborative culture between departments. The company does a good job pushing inclusivity efforts. That said, it's also hard to advance as the tenure here is quite long. You can get some small pay raises and the bonuses are reasonable, but it's difficult to move up. Free product, free food, free lunch, great collaboration, good corporate culture Lack of transparency, constant changes to campaigns, hard to advance It was a scene I ran the show at the pokemon league when it blew up. I gave out promo cards kept score, and generally was taaking care of and baby sitting 10-15 kids a day. I used to play as well so it made it pretty fun. Environment money An Absolute Joke I have many decades of experience in the workplace, many of them at top Fortune 500 companies. I have to say that WOtC is an absolute joke as far as their management is concerned. ""Scrum Masters"" with no knowledge of development run projects, which are deemed a ""success"" when released with over 100 bugs. Which, consequently, causing the business to STOP WORK. There were 4 people on my team when I started last year. At present, exactly 1 is left. Draw your own conclusions. I would AVOID like the plague. free pizza, nice art Everything else great place to play Magic; not a great place for one's career typical small successful business syndrome: arrogance and fear in the management culture based on past success and lack of clarity or alignment on inspection of strategy or operations. managers are afraid of looking bad, afraid of failing, and afraid of rocking the boat. This leads to timid strategy and poor follow through on delivering against anything but the smallest vision. In spite of this indictment, the people are smart, creative, and fun to work with. fun products, play is encouraged, many employees are trying to do good work poor compensation, aversion to continuous improvement, lots of fragile egos at the helm afraid of being unmasked as frauds/imposters Was a good place to work until recently The company was good at first when I started working there but with upper management changes and their subsequent change in direction led to a lot of confusion as to what the goals were and how our team was to support them. Due to this ambiguity, 30+ people were laid off recently which not only impacted the people being let go but few that stayed and had to assume the responsibilities. I would no longer recommend this company as a good, solid place to work for. Wizards has lost what makes it a great place to work. A company that has prided itself on being fun and relaxed has become a software shop where all devs have to work overtime and weekends to make ends meet. I was blind to how stressful the situation had become until I was on the outside looking in. Decent compensation, Excellent and diverse people, free product Pressure cooker atmosphere. Poor work life balance. Wonderful place and do wish that I was still employed at Wizards...under a different Manager The people at Wizards, office environment and work culture were great in addition to the proximity to my home. If I had a different manager, I would have been much happier and stayed with the company. Culture It is very much a game culture. They are very dedicated to their product and IP and making games folks will enjoy. The work/life balance is very good. You are able to participate in any game tests you desire. The company drives to make the customers wanting more of the products. Avoid if you are a woman Old boys network in IT promotes based on friendship, not qualifications. Total lack of understanding of how to set goals. They don't do data driven decision making. No Project Management organization, no business analysts. All Product Owners and Scrum Masters Only benefit was 1/2 day Friday. Salaries are below market (because people just want to work for us so we don't pay at market levels). Health care plan is high deductible with HSA so essentially, you pay everything unless you have a major illness. 9 1 Fun and Engaging Workplace Supervisors are very open to communication and work in close proximity to the rest of the Customer Service team. Full-timers are also on hand and happy to help with sticky questions as time allows! The workload itself can vary quite a lot, though a typical day will have 30-40 phone calls over your shift in addition to emails. The most challenging and enjoyable part of the job is the actual customer interaction- you get players of all skill levels calling in about everything under the sun for pretty much every game Wizards makes. Magic: the Gathering is definitely the most called-about, though, so I would highly recommend having a good baseline-understanding of the game and its mechanics. Free employee drafts and prereleases, paid breaks, supervisors very understanding re: sick days, flexible time off provided enough notice is given Inter-department communication needs work, don't receive free product on release due to contractor status 5 2 Current management team needs to be replaced! Wizards was a great place to work until the management team was replaced about 2 years ago. Since then, the great culture and environment of togetherness eroded until you get what you have today. Management leads using fear and bullying tactics that have destroyed the morale of the company. This was a great company that was built by gamers for gamers. It was a great place to work the first 3 or so years I was there. I wish it had stayed that way. Still produce great games. Current management team. it is just fine i am very happy to work there. i look at it and fine it just perfect. the environment is fine and the managers very cooperative. The work team they are very helpful And they are very systematic in office management. . Productive and great work culture Good Management Great Team coordination,much helpful team members in difficult time Superb work environment Weekly Playoffs good work and life balancing Free Lunches, snacks, Games Na you will really enjoy work here if you love games and knowing behind it(coding) Though my employment was only for a few sets, it was nevertheless an interesting and exciting experience. Being privy to classified information was simply amazing. Fun environment with many creative people and a full gym and daycare on site. As a game designer a Wizard of the Coast I created new games and helped other people improve their game designs.Games ranged from online one to card gmes, and board games. A typical day at work was fairlty self-directed, woking on individual prjojects. We'd show our projects and get opinions from other people. We would also play our new games among each other. When a game got close enough to potentially being produced we would to focus groups to see if we had writen the rules right and created an enjoyable game. Workplace culture was relaxed and a bit like a bit toy factory. The most enjoyble part of working for Wizards were the creative staff and the flexibiity to work on your project your way. The hardest part of the job was keeping up a steady stream of creative projects on a deadline. But Wizards taught me to do this. Creative Environment, Writing, Work/Life Balance Upper management stress, Sometimes unclear directions Technologically progressive within a work hard, game hard culture. Wizards of the Coast is the place to go when you want to work on/in an ever-changing environment. There are plenty of challenges as well as plenty of good humored people to take time out for a game of Magic. These people are always on the lookout for a new board or card game. It is not unusual to meet at the end of the day for D&D games or low-key Magic release parties. The people are fun and intellectual. Technical management doesn't know how to help if you run into trouble with your job. fun place to work ... management changed Work slowed and management changed over the years... was a great place to work. Loved my coworkers but management lacked in motivational skills. Good health benefits, high turn-over. People are nice, fun, and highly motivated. Most non-executives are fans of the games, they carry a lot of knowledge and personal experience. They are always happy to teach and share. The company offers good benefits for full-time employees but they also make changes mid-year. The turn-over is high and frequent, creating anxiety and uncertainty. But most people enjoy the fun workplace idea as the company promotes internal events, offers a game area, and full-time employees get other perks. Healthcare High turn-over Laid back culture, not for go-getters I'm torn, because I like it here, but I can't ignore the stodgy old world practices, and mentalities of crusty white men. They may just be too slow to be effective and disruptive in their development for the technical arena. Gaming is fun This company will give you the option to start a long career! Cant say enough good things about this company, they temp out a lot, which gives people an option to get their foot in the door. It's just okay. For a company like Wizards you would expect to be able to answer any and all questions that customers have when they call you, however there are certain questions that can only be answered and if you try your best to answer and help a customer out you get a slap on the wrist for it. Wish there would have been more clear and concise training to let you know. Great place to work with talented people Creative culture, amazingly talented people. Focus is on developing high quality games that provide the best user experience. Improved emphasis on employee appreciation and retention. Good benefits, yoga and strength training on site in private gym Little room for advancement, uneven management. Fun One of the best places i have worked. They truly care about their employees and take great care in what they do. They make sure the quality the except their customers receive, is reflected in the work environment. Very productive company with many physical and fun events -Mainly building and documenting software build processes -A very open minded company to their employees and contractors -Management was most always open to talk with and very supportive -My co-workers were fantastic and fun to work with -Attending all of the meetings that were scheduled was very hard to keep up with -What I enjoyed most was working with so many talented people Lots of gaming in the evening Gamers Paradise A truely wonderful place to work - until its liquidation in 2004. Wizards was my first retail job as well as my first leadership role in the retail work field and I miss it often! A company, if revived, I would go back and work for without question. Great place to work always interesting Fun imaginative work environment never a dull moment and always new things to learn and goals to achieve. Great people, employees, and vendors busy work place no cons for me Generally positive experience Managed infrastructure requirements for product SDLC. Facilitated exploration, planning, construction and delivery of new and updated product. Created project, product and service business and technical documentation. There is a family atmosphere that facilitates an informal culture.It is often difficult to track changes and provide accountability around product tasks. Game testing during business hours. Free table with food and gear. High turnover. Business vision not consistently communicated. Great environment to work. The typical day included answering questions from customers, retailers, and fans through email or phone. I learned a lot about efficiency and developing good work flow and habits. The management was great to work with and great about providing the tools or assistance needed to get the job done right. My coworkers were excellent, sharing similar tastes and work ethics that drove our teams to do some amazing customer service work. The hardest part of the job was only the occasional difficult customer and the most enjoyable part was assisting with game support and rules questions. Work with amazing games. Contracting position, so no benefits, holidays or vacations. It is very much a game culture. They are very dedicated to their product and IP and making games folks will enjoy. The work/life balance is very good. You are able to participate in any game tests you desire. The company drives to make the customers wanting more of the products. An enlightening and engaging work environment Please ask for further information. This is a great company to work for. 1 8 Fun Place to Work Wizards of the Coast provides a fun atmosphere to work in. Since it is a gaming company, there are always other employees willing to chat about or play games with you during break times. Additionally health and other benefits were extremely desirable. I typically spent most of my time on the phone with customers. If I was off the phone I was either answering customer emails or working on special projects. The most difficult part of my job had to be balancing time management between tasks. 4 1 Really fun teams. There's a dragon in reception The people who work at WotC are very passionate about what we produce, games and entertainment. There is a strong following inside the company of the games we create and there is a pride felt in the employees. It is easy to get into a role and be stuck there or be ""advanced"" into a position that does not fit correctly. ""Free Table"" often has free SWAG. Lots of people to game with on breaks. Advancement is very difficult. Salaries are not quite competitive. Fast Paced Design Company Excellent place for growth within your position. Was a great place for connecting and making life-long professional contacts. For those interested in Magic: the Gathering, it's a job to die for. Though my employment was only for a few sets, it was nevertheless an interesting and exciting experience. Being privy to classified information was simply amazing. Exclusive information, having a hand in the creation of new card Didn't last as long as I had hoped. Best place to work if you games We worked hard, played hard and traveled the world. Best working experience to date. Really smart people and Magic Not many It is very much a game culture. They are very dedicated to their product and IP and making games folks will enjoy. The work/life balance is very good. You are able to participate in any game tests you desire. The company drives to make the customers wanting more of the products. Not kind to senior employees. Company seems to want to replace seniors with young ones always. Good place for young talented people who needs experience for step up for another company.

If you don't do exactly as you're told ... well, you probably see the pattern here. There is an obvious culture of favoritism in the company today. Certain teams and departments continually receive budget, functional freedom, headcount, and legitimate consideration for their ideas. The rest are on their own.

WotC was a great place to work but with the new management, some people in some departments are suffering due to their ignorance and I do love the games and the cards, however. They are piece of art that no other company can come close to. You do have opportunities to learn if you desire so. It's really up to you how to make your career at this place as long as you are contributing to the company. I guess that's always the case at any company. Free products as FTE. Good work & life balance. New management cares less fun place to work WotC is a fun place to work as it is a gaming company. There are usually lots of opportunities to advance and move onto various teams if you network and keep your eyes open. It's fun being a Wizard There is lots of free product, free food, and good conversation in the building. However, everyone works hard as well. There is a good collaborative culture between departments. The company does a good job pushing inclusivity efforts. That said, it's also hard to advance as the tenure here is quite long.

Environment money An Absolute Joke I have many decades of experience in the workplace, many of them at top Fortune 500 companies. I have to say that WOtC is an absolute joke as far as their management is concerned. ""Scrum Masters"" with no knowledge of development run projects, which are deemed a ""success"" when released with over 100 bugs. Which, consequently, causing the business to STOP WORK. There were 4 people on my team when I started last year. At present, exactly 1 is left. Draw your own conclusions. I would AVOID like the plague. free pizza, nice art Everything else great place to play Magic; not a great place for one's career typical small successful business syndrome: arrogance and fear in the management culture based on past success and lack of clarity or alignment on inspection of strategy or operations. managers are afraid of looking bad, afraid of failing, and afraid of rocking the boat. This leads to timid strategy and poor follow through on delivering against anything but the smallest vision. In spite of this indictment, the people are smart, creative, and fun to work with. fun products, play is encouraged, many employees are trying to do good work poor compensation, aversion to continuous improvement, lots of fragile egos at the helm afraid of being unmasked as frauds/imposters Was a good place to work until recently The company was good at first when I started working there but with upper management changes and their subsequent change in direction led to a lot of confusion as to what the goals were and how our team was to support them. Due to this ambiguity, 30+ people were laid off recently which not only impacted the people being let go but few that stayed and had to assume the responsibilities. I would no longer recommend this company as a good, solid place to work for. Wizards has lost what makes it a great place to work. A company that has prided itself on being fun and relaxed has become a software shop where all devs have to work overtime and weekends to make ends meet. I was blind to how stressful the situation had become until I was on the outside looking in. Decent compensation, Excellent and diverse people, free product Pressure cooker atmosphere. Poor work life balance. Wonderful place and do wish that I was still employed at Wizards...under a different Manager The people at Wizards, office environment and work culture were great in addition to the proximity to my home. If I had a different manager, I would have been much happier and stayed with the company. Culture It is very much a game culture. They are very dedicated to their product and IP and making games folks will enjoy. The work/life balance is very good. You are able to participate in any game tests you desire. The company drives to make the customers wanting more of the products. Not kind to senior employees. Company seems to want to replace seniors with young ones always. Good place for young talented people who needs experience for step up for another company. If you are looking to build a career in a same company, I would not recommend. Productive and fun workplace Working for WOTC was the best job I have ever had. Unfortunately, I had to leave due to disability. The management was good, not micromanaging, and the people there are passionate about creating a product that elevates the customer experience. Work culture None` Christmas Layoffs...enough said. Under paid, though my direct management was wonderful. However, our team was broken up and outsourced, and they lay off 15% of their workforce every Christmas, so don't get attached. Nope. Uh-huh. Not great. Questionable culture. Used to be great but now is all about the bottom line. Have lost sight of what used to make them great for their customers. Best place I have ever worked at. This is by far the best place I have ever worked at in my entire life would recommend anyone who is thinking to apply here. The work days are fun. The employees are actually the best people ever and everyday is just enjoyable. Fantastic Workplace with Great Culture Let me preface this by saying I was only a Contractor at Wizards of the Coast. As such, i didn't receive certain benefits that employees would receive. However during my time there, I learned a lot about call center practices and procedures, product knowledge, and much needed experience. Competitive, Low Compensation but Great People and Products Was brought on as a contractor through a 3rd party agency called Tapfin. I applied to numerous positions for permanent work, however it's a very sought after workplace and potential employees are willing to take a pay cut and a demotion to work there. This makes it very difficult for anyone else trying to break into the workplace. Very competitive. While at Wizards of the Coast, it was a great place to work with loads of awesome people. Can't say enough about how amazing the people are. I enjoyed being there even if some of the work was tedious and mind-numbing at times. While I didn't like the repetition of the work I was doing I loved being there. As a contractor, it's a great place to work if you want the experience and are looking to get a foot in the door but you should know that chances of you staying there are very VERY slim. Plus pay is not enough to live on in the Greater Seattle area, especially if taking benefits. Good company, but knows you want to work there. They know every person wants to work there. Pay will take a hit because they can fill the seats without a problem. However it is also a great place to work for, people are very passionate about the work they do and the things they create there, so everything comes out with love. Looks awesome on resume, everyone in games knows Magic the Gathering. No real chance for movement up, management can be slow to respond to things. Lots of changes. My second week there, there was a huge corporate restructure. Process fell apart and this was in addition to learning a new job and culture. It made doing creative work extra difficult. Luckily, it looks like there are some changes happening and I would love another opportunity to work there in the future to see how that change has taken root. Really fun and engaging work. Making high-fantasy design is really fun. Culture was a little icy. Some really dumb corporate practices. Back in The Day... There was a day when WotC was a fun, supportive, adventurous place to work, but it is not this day. Several years ago the company started recruiting managers from outside the company. Not inherently negative but it did impact the culture of creativity, exploration and experimentation. The drive from senior leadership (if you could call it that) was to take the slack out of the schedules and hit delivery dates 'or else.' Once again, not a negative itself but it was joined with yearly reorganizations followed by layoffs. It was so common the employees would ascertain the exact date of the layoff before it was announced (winner of the pool didn't have to buy the first round). Over time, the number of people doing the actual work has decreased as the number of deliverable assets, game releases and components continues to climb. Overtime is expected and if you're not doing it, you're not a team player. If you speak to members of another team with anything but the utmost in reverence, you're not a team player. If you explain to an internal customer that you can't do something because there are other jobs already in progress or there aren't enough hours in the day to include their request, you're not a team player. If you don't do exactly as you're told ... well, you probably see the pattern here. There is an obvious culture of favoritism in the company today.

Lucid Motors|" Electrical repair technician Great place to work everybody very friendly. If your looking for a company to get into from the ground floor here’s your chance. The future is here so grab it while you can because it’s not going to last. This company is going to go a long way so the future is bright here. Is the future of the automotive industry. And if you get in early enough the sky is the limit. Young company so some times you don’t have everything to work with 14 9 Managers makes all decisions even without proper competency Major decisions are often made by managers without the proper level of competency. Very high level of turnovers with higher than industry/vertical percentage of turnovers and burnouts. Not enough recognitions for dedicated and sincere workers. Management lacks transparency and integrity. 2 Has its Pros and Cons Good pay and benefits Bad communication, work a lot Obviously good for those who are workaholics. Lot of overtime opportunities. Yet sometimes people have hobbies want to live a more exciting life 3 No work-life balance! If you are a workaholic Lucid will be the place for you but if you are someone who values a good work-life balance Lucid is NOT the place for you. It all comes down to what you value most in your life. Don't be fooled by the good pay & benefits, the expectation is that you give all of your time to this company. Pay & Benefits Communication; Long hours; No work-life balance; On the job training No life balance Too much from employees but don’t give time for family….customer first..family last it’s all about them and not employees….you do so much but you’re just a number… Great place to work / company that actually cares about its people Working at Lucid is great, the management is top class, and even upper management is good as well. The work culture is great, and the people who work for us are great as well. Very mature, like-minded, diverse individual with so much talent! This company is going to go far Pay / Work culture / Benefits None Tough Work six days sometimes it is needed. Alot of movemnt better be in good shape. A lot of walking better have shoes (steel toe). Depends on what you like to do . Reason I cannot express more or less of my job is due to an nda agreement you have to sign in the beginning. Work is plenty it is a start up company Work alot Work alot Excellent Company and Supportive Management Excellent work environment. Everyone is very respectful and supportive of each other in my team. People at Lucid are goal driven and this company makes an excellent product that we are all proud to be Lucidians. Better benefits than most companies in AZ. You get promised a raise and can take several months for the company to even think about giving it to you. On April 11th, I was “promoted, but promptly got treated poorly and then led to a demotion, with out even receive my “raise” now they won’t back pay. Good money if they actually give you a raise. No work life balance, limited sick days/pto, attendance points punish you for things that happen out side of your control, managers and supervisors play favorites. Service department I have worked in service for roughly a year. The leadership only cares for themselves and treats their employees with disrespect. The work team is great and work well together. Amazing product, meaningful workday, great pay, but little work/life balance. The company does a great job to incentivize people to come in and work hard. Offering all the OT you could ask for (and even more you don't want). The cars are spectacular, and the people are great. There has been lots of management re-structuring, but there are not many ""challenging"" people to deal with. The main negative is of course: The hours. It is expected to work 60 hours a week minimum, even if on salary. Some roles have it harder than others, but in general, if you work at all tied to production, you MIGHT get one Sunday off a week, and even then it will probably be On-Call. Great compensation Long hours, mandatory OT, few days off (if any) Toxic environment with no work life balance Pay is great but there is no life work balance. There are a lot of supervisors but no leaders. Communication is horrible at best. If you only care about making money Lucid is you place. If you like chaos and poor management, Lucid is your place. Dont work here This place is a joke. The pay is awesome but dont expect to have any days off or a set schedule. Dont try to request days off either because it wont get approved. Honestly i dont think this company is going to survive. Pay Terrible managers Inaccurate job assignments, inability to reach HR, lack of caring from management You’re basically a cow, in a large heard of cattle. Long hours, lack of communication. Love it or leave it mentality. Be very careful taking the job. Worst work place Fired a lot of us without cause worked 30 days straight 12-18 hour days and they did not car me that I had to drive home. They never have parts they need to build the cars. Paychecks are GREAT that’s it If you want to earn a lot of money on your paychecks this is the place to work. Trust me I make so much money due to working mandatory overtime it’s insane. If you have a family say goodbye to them because the way you work 6 or 7 days a week 12 hour shifts and the time you have to go in and get out you may not be able to see them anymore. If you have medical conditions and need to see the doctor you only get 40 hours a year in sick time you can use BUT I was told you need to get it APPROVED before you can just take the day off plus HR told me they don’t accept medical notes for the days off. So you rack up points even if you are ill and can’t go in to work. Supervisors move around a lot so you don’t know who you are really reporting to, upper management has meetings 5 minutes prior to leaving and adding 30 minutes to your time when leaving, also they degrade you by saying things like ” I have a built resume I can go anywhere I want for a job, you people need this job and the money and cannot get another good paying job like this.” So you better have tough skin or end up crying like some people here. No real job training I learned by getting a binder and going into the field picking up knowledge on my own and by co workers learning too. So really think before you leap. Overall good but Bad Overall good work place but mangers are always on a power trip. Make sure your background is good and drug test to pass. Don’t work here if you like being in the heat because they have no AC in AZ. Horrible Management Work life balance is just Horrible, management is bad, some could never make it as a manager anywhere else. Company is lying to the public, they could never make all the cars the told there investors, it was a shame. Supply chain is a problem that they created. They are burning though employees left and right. They will never find enough people in the area to work 70+ hours a week. Employees are burnt out. Productive and Enjoyble Managers trained with care and made sure I understood my duties, fellow workers also helped to make the experience flow with ease. I was only there a month but it was a great learning experience. Friendly workers Long work days Good potential Just started working here but the recruitment process was a headache. Difficult to get in contact with some recruiters. Not sure what the hours are like but scared based on other reviews Dont work for this pathetic company The training here is beyond pathetic. The work/life balance is pathetic. You are expected to work 6-7 days a week with little to no notice. Management/Supervision totally sucks. Pay Lack of training Electrical repair technician Great place to work everybody very friendly. If your looking for a company to get into from the ground floor here’s your chance. The future is here so grab it while you can because it’s not going to last. This company is going to go a long way so the future is bright here. Is the future of the automotive industry. And if you get in early enough the sky is the limit. Young company so some times you don’t have everything to work with 14 9 Horrible place to work No work life balance. You are expected to work long hours with no advance notice. No room for growth. Company offers really good benefits and time off. 14 2 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? Friends I've made since I started working here. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Where should I start? I would put zero stars If I had the chance. 1. Work-life balance. ZERO! You have to be available for the Company 24/7, they don't care if you have plans already; Get ready to work after 6 pm everyday, Saturday and Sundays all day. You'll be forced to install teams on your phone and guess what? Company owns you! 2. Culture. Very toxic culture, no partnership, everybody looking for their own business and stabbing others. 3. No growth. Get ready to work as a production operator, forklift, cleaning person, cooker, material distributer or anything the Company asks, even if you're a manager. 4. No clear objectives. You never know what your objectives or goals are, you just have to be there for anything the company asks. This is by far, the worst Company I have ever worked for, please think about 5 times before joining. 7 The workers are helpful with eachother Lucid has the potential to be a good company . But you under paid and there's a lot of favoritism but kissing manament is terrible they hire people that could not manage a junkyard let alone a assembly line they send workers home without pay and they don't care . which causes quality to go down because workers don't care any more everyone is looking for another job Workers work well with eachother I would stay away manament is terrible Communication is excellent In my experience, communication is key to a successful career. At Lucid Motors, the staff is very verbal and respectful with each other and also humorous. I loved working there. Mexican food wagon everyday. None Way too many hours. Zero work/life balance. 80+ hours a week. Pay and benefits are good but not worth it. Minimal weekends off. No idea how many hours you’re working day to day. Pay, Benefits, Good food options Way way way too many hours Good coworkers, bad everything else If you're ready to spend 100% of your life at a company that doesn't really care about you, then this is it! Management doesn't care about you, your life, your kids, or any of your responsibilities outside of work. Work MUST be your #1 priority at all times and you MUST be flexible on literally everything from your schedule to knowing your job(they change work instructions pretty much daily still). The best thing about this job is clocking out and going home. The worst part is lack of communication and MANAGEMENT. Pay is not that great, and you could work at In N Out down the street for almost the same wage. Honestly, it's not worth it at all to have management lie to you repeatedly about everything and then blame you for believing in what they told you. They can do better There's no clear directions or goals. It's all about how good are you kissing butts to get promoted or job secured. The most enjoyable part? when I leave to go home. Shady changes and terms about RSU's. Some Managers without automotive experience and not willing to learn The worst place I've ever worked Mannagement is very Indisizive. The rules change on a daily basis.Skills and or knowledge aren't necessary. Brown nosing is the most recognized skill. There is alot of back stabing Great employees to work with management is horrible How the company presented themselves from interview thru orientation, is completely opposite of how they really are. I came in truly excited but have now seen what they really think and how they treat their employees. You can get a better job and be treated better for $18 an hour. Benefits package is good EVERYTHING the company says they are is a complete lie Nice people to work with Management is horrible. Culture is nonexistent. HR doesn't care about employees. I would never recommend this place to anyone. In the last 2 months. About 40 employees have quit. If your a single parent. Or want a life. And want to be treated like you matter. Don't work here. Currently looking for a new job. Horrible place to work. Good pay Management sucks. HR sucks. Work life balance doesn't exist. No culture. Not great Compared to other manufacturers in the area they have very low pay. They make you work mandatory overtime with little to no notice. The only good thing here is the opportunity to advance and job security Job security, advancement opportunities Short breaks, low pay, no home life Nice product poor management Work life balance was bad, had to stay late almost every day. Manager had no emotional awareness, poor people skills. Other people were nice and enjoyable to work with. Lucid Dreaming Amazing and talenteo people surround you. Building the next cars of the future and understanding. Perks are good and the on-site gym. Right of the Dunbarton bridge and close by all. A great product with great vision but poor leaders Lucid has the opportunity to be a great company to work for; I believe the buddy system here is where workers will lose confidence in the company. Hire the people that work hard, not your friends. Of course being a young company that's trying to get off the ground will have some issues and people in positions they normally wouldn't be qualified for, which brings me to the pay. The managers here are hit and miss, either you have a great one or a poor one. And the balance of compensation is bad. I do believe the managers are over paid, undertrained and lack emotional intelligence along with accountability. Power is normally a issue when given to men, that's nothing new. But power given to the wrong men here is a huge problem. Inclusion is poor, but there is a great migration of different ethnicities here. Doesn't show in management though. Inclusive leaders demonstrate courage in two ways: Cognizance of bias and cultural intelligence. I still believe this company will be great, with any company time will fix things!! Great people, different backgrounds, so much to learn Poor leadership Great opportunity poorly led CEO/CTO is out of his area of competence. A talented engineer with very poor people skills, emotional maturity or inclusion. Work/life balance and overall culture are poor. Productive fun place to work around R&D working experience really lifted up my skill levels and all the Manager was great. No micromanagement, you just have to be who you are and bring the best of your skills set every single days. A place with great potential to be awesome The management are all very decent people. But the lack of maturity or sharpness at professional level could hurt. The fun and stressful part of the job is you get to work with and learn from people from very different backgrounds. You will enjoy working with brilliant thinkers at one moment and struggle with people not quite suitable for the title or job at others. That is very different from working for big companies where people share similar qualities. Lucid Motors Having been in the industry 30+ years _ i have never worked in a company with so much cross functional collaboration The advances made in the company in the short time is second to non Of all the positions I have had in my career - Lucid is the one I have enjoyed the most work culture and team collaboration none N/a 1.

Dont work here This place is a joke. The pay is awesome but dont expect to have any days off or a set schedule. Dont try to request days off either because it wont get approved. Honestly i dont think this company is going to survive. Pay Terrible managers Inaccurate job assignments, inability to reach HR, lack of caring from management You’re basically a cow, in a large heard of cattle. Long hours, lack of communication. Love it or leave it mentality. Be very careful taking the job. Worst work place Fired a lot of us without cause worked 30 days straight 12-18 hour days and they did not car me that I had to drive home. They never have parts they need to build the cars. Paychecks are GREAT that’s it If you want to earn a lot of money on your paychecks this is the place to work. Trust me I make so much money due to working mandatory overtime it’s insane. If you have a family say goodbye to them because the way you work 6 or 7 days a week 12 hour shifts and the time you have to go in and get out you may not be able to see them anymore. If you have medical conditions and need to see the doctor you only get 40 hours a year in sick time you can use BUT I was told you need to get it APPROVED before you can just take the day off plus HR told me they don’t accept medical notes for the days off. So you rack up points even if you are ill and can’t go in to work. Supervisors move around a lot so you don’t know who you are really reporting to, upper management has meetings 5 minutes prior to leaving and adding 30 minutes to your time when leaving, also they degrade you by saying things like ” I have a built resume I can go anywhere I want for a job, you people need this job and the money and cannot get another good paying job like this.” So you better have tough skin or end up crying like some people here. No real job training I learned by getting a binder and going into the field picking up knowledge on my own and by co workers learning too. So really think before you leap. Overall good but Bad Overall good work place but mangers are always on a power trip. Make sure your background is good and drug test to pass. Don’t work here if you like being in the heat because they have no AC in AZ. Horrible Management Work life balance is just Horrible, management is bad, some could never make it as a manager anywhere else. Company is lying to the public, they could never make all the cars the told there investors, it was a shame. Supply chain is a problem that they created. They are burning though employees left and right. They will never find enough people in the area to work 70+ hours a week. Employees are burnt out. Productive and Enjoyble Managers trained with care and made sure I understood my duties, fellow workers also helped to make the experience flow with ease. I was only there a month but it was a great learning experience. Friendly workers Long work days Good potential Just started working here but the recruitment process was a headache. Difficult to get in contact with some recruiters. Not sure what the hours are like but scared based on other reviews Dont work for this pathetic company The training here is beyond pathetic. The work/life balance is pathetic. You are expected to work 6-7 days a week with little to no notice. Management/Supervision totally sucks. Pay Lack of training Electrical repair technician Great place to work everybody very friendly. If your looking for a company to get into from the ground floor here’s your chance. The future is here so grab it while you can because it’s not going to last. This company is going to go a long way so the future is bright here. Is the future of the automotive industry. And if you get in early enough the sky is the limit. Young company so some times you don’t have everything to work with 14 9 Managers makes all decisions even without proper competency Major decisions are often made by managers without the proper level of competency. Very high level of turnovers with higher than industry/vertical percentage of turnovers and burnouts. Not enough recognitions for dedicated and sincere workers. Management lacks transparency and integrity. 2 Has its Pros and Cons Good pay and benefits Bad communication, work a lot Obviously good for those who are workaholics. Lot of overtime opportunities. Yet sometimes people have hobbies want to live a more exciting life 3 No work-life balance! If you are a workaholic Lucid will be the place for you but if you are someone who values a good work-life balance Lucid is NOT the place for you. It all comes down to what you value most in your life. Don't be fooled by the good pay & benefits, the expectation is that you give all of your time to this company. Pay & Benefits Communication; Long hours; No work-life balance; On the job training No life balance Too much from employees but don’t give time for family….customer first..family last it’s all about them and not employees….you do so much but you’re just a number… Great place to work / company that actually cares about its people Working at Lucid is great, the management is top class, and even upper management is good as well. The work culture is great, and the people who work for us are great as well. Very mature, like-minded, diverse individual with so much talent! This company is going to go far Pay / Work culture / Benefits None Tough Work six days sometimes it is needed. Alot of movemnt better be in good shape. A lot of walking better have shoes (steel toe). Depends on what you like to do . Reason I cannot express more or less of my job is due to an nda agreement you have to sign in the beginning. Work is plenty it is a start up company Work alot Work alot Excellent Company and Supportive Management Excellent work environment. Everyone is very respectful and supportive of each other in my team. People at Lucid are goal driven and this company makes an excellent product that we are all proud to be Lucidians. Better benefits than most companies in AZ. You get promised a raise and can take several months for the company to even think about giving it to you. On April 11th, I was “promoted, but promptly got treated poorly and then led to a demotion, with out even receive my “raise” now they won’t back pay. Good money if they actually give you a raise. No work life balance, limited sick days/pto, attendance points punish you for things that happen out side of your control, managers and supervisors play favorites. Service department I have worked in service for roughly a year. The leadership only cares for themselves and treats their employees with disrespect. The work team is great and work well together. Amazing product, meaningful workday, great pay, but little work/life balance. The company does a great job to incentivize people to come in and work hard. Offering all the OT you could ask for (and even more you don't want). The cars are spectacular, and the people are great. There has been lots of management re-structuring, but there are not many ""challenging"" people to deal with. The main negative is of course: The hours. It is expected to work 60 hours a week minimum, even if on salary. Some roles have it harder than others, but in general, if you work at all tied to production, you MIGHT get one Sunday off a week, and even then it will probably be On-Call. Great compensation Long hours, mandatory OT, few days off (if any) Toxic environment with no work life balance Pay is great but there is no life work balance.

Nike|" Fun workplace I've worked here for almost two years and I can honestly say I've made some of the greatest friends, built life long relationships and gained amazing skills. 4 Cool I worked there for 5 years and loved every minute of it. Management was great to work with and I felt a sense of belonging. There was always something happening at the club and it was a fun environment to work in. Coworkers were the best part of the job! Some of them have been there longer than I have been alive. Best place I've ever worked. 1 Ok Wrong boss Long hours Horrible pay Management was horrible across the board I hated working here Just free shoes and clothes 1 Fun productive place The interview was straight forward and the manager talked me to through everything.Overall it’s nice on the inside and very busy but I’m sure I can keep up. Good company Good company for growth. Benefits are awesome. all inclusive easy to do fun environment opportunities to transfer to other departments. loved it and would reccommend Fine seasonally, not long term Ok for part time work, management is fine but brand loyalty goes into overtime here. Nike above everything. Always have to be ON even when customers are absurd. Working Black Friday and Thanksgiving back to back is not healthy. Promises of holidays bonuses never fulfilled from this time period either. Productive & Fun workplace I really enjoyed my time at NIKE. Great team oriented individuals! HR was very open and supportive. Also the work environment was great I loved working with my coworkers. Great company, average age of staff is 33 Great place to have a challenging and fun career. Lots of opportunity for learning and advancement. Excellent pay and benefits. Downsides - Every few years deep cuts in resources and layoffs. You have to manage your work-life balance, or you won’t have one. Work environment Management doesn't know their responsibilities and half a@ there roles. Some managers get positions and have no idea what they are doing. Employees don't get trained properly , very low work coverage leaving the few employees over worked. No parking for employees so they have to park in streets which is almost 15m walk and they leave at 11pm night so that's dangerous. 40% off though so that's something but not worth it. Hour lunch Work Availablity is full 7 days because of ""peak hours"" so no work life balance, No employee parking, hourly wage is bad train well they provide you with a lot of tools to succeed in your position. Not much incentives, and not a lot of room for exceeding your position. Culture is not sincere. Fun workplace Nice work environment great benefits I will recommend this job to anyone. I am a college student manager works well with me to accommodate my schedule Fun Not a lot of advancement from the position, but a great place to meet cool people and work on fun projects. Also great benefits while working at nike. Experience Depends on Location Nike is a great company to work for. Lots of benefits and you work with good people. However, like any retail job, management can make the job worse than what it is. At my location, sometimes you feel unappreciated or disrespected which is unfortunate. I've seen the workplace change over the years and the turnover rate has been pretty high recently. Easy fix, but it's only fixable if the management as a whole would listen to their employees. Otherwise, it was great working there and low stress. Tensions have been high recently. Fun Workplace, Good Pay, Great Benefits Even For Part-Time Workers Sometimes It Is Very Demanding For A Part-Time Employee, Not Too Much Of A Work to Life Balance, Management Is Neglecting Of Employees Fun You get alot of discounts on stuff selected. Management is good. Been here for a long time and its been going great . Work here it’s really nice i will definitely recommend Okay Workplace Managers are nice but you put in a lot of hours for okay pay. They schedule you for hours and you spend time just standing around doing nothing. Honestly it’s best being part time than full time if anything. Amazing Fun as can be. Everyday is a new adventure. There willbe crunch times but what Are times without a little bit of rush. And the end of year parties. Amazing fun workplace it is very good workplace. and i really apply for I sent in a bag to get repaired. I had new handles and lining put on it because they were pretty worn. Getting the bag returned to me was a process. I had to keep trying to contact the company and they ended up eventually overnighting it to me because I waited for months to get it back and had no contact from them until I initiated it. I was informed it would be $300 for the repairs which was fine. A very healthy environment Working at Nike is very good. I love the company but they put me in a department where I really didn’t want to be and I’m a very hard worker. but other than that it is good. Divertido Muy lindo trabajo con responsabilidad y compromiso It’s ok Fun, but people mess around to much there and management doesn’t care. Breaks are kinda dumb, time starts when they call break not when your actually in the break room. And your expected to be back before your break is actually over micromanaging long days that are insanely busy. so emotionally draining. the clientele is rough. everyone is entitled including management. everyone is always better than you. Fun workplace I've worked here for almost two years and I can honestly say I've made some of the greatest friends, built life long relationships and gained amazing skills. 4 Fair It is a fair place to work. Coworkers are very helpful and friendly easy to communicate with. Management dont really listen to employer. You really have Good Love this place, loved the people, loved the environment and the culture. Nothing bad to say. Great benefits and everyone loves getting discounts on shoes. Its fun Its fun when you have a love for shoes and nike products. Its even better when you get along with your coworkers (!).In all, the customers are usually happy. Not my fav place There's lots of hoops to jump thru to get anything done thru management. I got hurt and after a period of time I was let go. There are clicks and groups and it's great if you want a job that you just turn your brain off for Great staring place Able to have a work/life balance. Everyone was so nice and helpful. They would have potlucks especially for thanksgiving. Employee discounts Bad: sometimes they would send you home early due to not having enough hours . Early morning shifts that begin at 3am great environment easy work great atmosphere, rush during black friday had its perks. would definitely recommend to any high school or college students looking for part time work Fun and energetic workplace Managers and Coworkers were great. it was awesome learning about all of Nikes different technologies. I enjoyed building relationships with both Coworkers and customers. Productive Buen lugar todo limpio ordenado y cumplimiento de horario Nada malo que decir un buen trabajo y buen sueldo sin duda alguna lo maximo lo haria otra vez Okay for students The job is pretty flexible and they have a lot of fun perks like the discount and employee digital shop. Long germ, I would not recommend to stay too long. Clique heavy environment and under qualified management. Good pay for retail work Being on your feet all day and dealing with customers can be draining but the pay is good for retail. Easy to move up to full time if the position is available. Abusive work and hostile work environment A glorified sweat shop. Very repetitive work for 12 hour shifts. Work closely with fellow employees. They just see you as a body and do not take work place safety seriously. Managers only care about numbers and the product, not actual issues. Get injured and they will not support you at all. Fun workplace Very blessed place to work at and good management and the staff was excellent and the managers was pretty cool to as well, they cared about there employees. Good work place I enjoyed working here and it was a Good job. I liked the employee discount the most and being able to see all the clothes first hand when you work in the stock room Complex Very cool place to work, they really do live by their corporate strategy. On the other hand, Just Do It mentality, has resulted in everyone trying to solve similar challenges without accountability. Lots of stress Good pay Fun and productive. Very Good pay. Nice team member. Very flexible schedule and hours. Good benefits. Worked on weekends and holidays. Part timer only Bad management but decent job I guess Some of management was terrible and the other part wasn’t. Coworkers are great though. You work here as part time and you’ll pretty much never have a weekend off Decent I mean I’m on the sales floor you really get to see everything, from grumpy customers to random athletes coming in on their days off at times. The discount is actually really nice. Great culture built to help you achieve your goals while caring about you as a person. Nike does a great job of empowering teammates to perform their best by providing support for you as an employee and as a person. They truly care about health, wellness and employee well being and it shows up in the way they prioritize and invest in mental and health benefits. The culture is also driven by innovation and dedicated to serving athletes around the world. Great place to work and grow personally and professionally. Fun and chill work environment The work environment is fun and quite simple, easy to catch on. The discount is awesome. For the most part not a bad job. Management? not the best, for the most part when you get hired they throw you onto the other athletes to get trained, & with the turnover being so bad it’s basically new people training you. they don’t move people around a lot, if they see you’re good somewhere they will stick you there until you’re burnt out! Fun place to work Great place to work if you're in college. Meet a lot of new people. hardest part of the job is the consumers and making sure they leave the store happy. Fun workplace I've worked here for almost two years and I can honestly say I've made some of the greatest friends, built life long relationships and gained amazing skills. 4 Experience Excellent environment. Great team meetings. Enjoyed working with a diverse culture and helping others find things they needed. The brand itself holds a standard, and being apart of the team elevated that Awesome! It was awesome and I loved it. A typical day included going to the store and selling a lot of products but items so great they sell their selves. I enjoy working here and it was a blast! Fun place to work at Nike is a good company to work for. They really value work life balance an dtry to put people's health in the first place. However it feels a bit like everyone wants to be cool and if you are not cool you do not fit in. Excelente ambiente laboral Excelente ambiente laboral, competitivo oportunidad de desarrollo Fun place Great place to work if your young and need a job. I had fun working there when i was in highschool. Good for entry level workers and kids who want a discount #2 worst place I've worked in How well your day goes really depends on who you are working with. One day you'll be with a good team, next day you could be with the worst of them. Most PMOs are really out of touch, wasting time chatting around, but giving you **** if anything goes wrong. And things will go wrong, since half the time those machines don't work properly. If you are in your late teens/early twenties loud and obnoxious and like to waste your time and not take your job seriously, then you'll be right at home! otherwise, look somewhere else. generous breaks Bad leadership, poor equipment maintenance Great for college student I enjoyed working here while I was in college. The pay and hours were great for part time. There were times where they would schedule me during my class times, but worked with me after a call. fun the discount that comes with job is pretty good other than that it all depends where you work. Coworkers are there to help and are always nice, they make you feel welcome nice team huddles Excelent environment. Great team meetings. Enjoyed working with a diverse culture and helpping others find things they needed. The brand itself holds a standard, and being apart of the team elevated that. Productive I am starting to work for liveops 10/27. Wish me luck. I don’t know the pay or benefits at this time but I do know you make your own hours, which is pretty good. great great place to work. I love working there. Staff is very supportive. I feel comfortable worker here. Customers are great. good benefits and a salary. 4 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Management was really good at their job and supporting their entire staff. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? long shifts on weekends means a chance for lot of crowds to service. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Supportive, community like What is a typical day like for you at the company? Clock in on time, check in with manager leader for shift duties, work those duties, break / lunch and continue working Not bad Not bad, Basic work, nothing to wild other than making shoes. Opportunity's arise occasionally. work with contracted workers. Money isnt the greatest but job is super easy Productive low pay East Job but just need better pay , fun workplace environment, professional managers great place to start at but it’s hard to move up location is good b Underpaid You would be hired as part-time and be scheduled as a full-time employee only making 15.75? Not worth it. Also didn’t give me the opportunity to have any other job with the terrible scheduling. Peers make this worthwhile. However pay is low Benefits are pretty good. Pay is low for a multibillion dollar corporation. Retail sales is just that. You have to deal with the day to day of some happy some not so happy consumers. If you are on the retail side, but feel that it is not for you, be mindful of sharing that with your supervisors. If they are helpful, they will help you achieve more from the company. If they are not, they will shun and punish you in some manner. Nike Franchises in South Africa aren't a good place, even for first time employment. Bad pay. 1 Day off. Managers complain about everything and you get in trouble for confronting or raising concerns. Their employer turnover rate is high. Solid Solid place to work at not even gonna lie, relaxing, easy, all depends on the manager you have. But overall if you’re a college student or in hs I recommend Looking to grow with a company this is a good place to start Nike is a great place to work for those who want to work. If you want to do nothing and get paid, not the place for you. You have to go after what you want and they will find ways to make it happen for you. Rewarding experiences Working in this retail environment you have alot of great experiences and opportunities as well as learn alot of people, communication, & problem solving skills. It's tough leading through staffing challenges, ongoing illnesses, & personal issues but the team has empathy for eachother and works as a team when challenging times arise. Fun workplace I've worked here for almost two years and I can honestly say I've made some of the greatest friends, built life long relationships and gained amazing skills. 4 Fun Workplace for College/HS Student Definitely a fun workplace as a College student as I made lots of friends and made the workload a bit easier to get through. After awhile it feels repetitive and the pay wasn't as good as I stayed there for several years. It is a good place to start and get experience and make new connections, but I wouldn't stay for the long term just for discounts and pay. Productive and fun workplace. Great way to make friends and build connections. Good work environment. Half way decent potlucks. Good pay if your a college student trying to pick up a job on the side. Store management needs major changes though. Favoritism is a practice often used in this store. Great company but… Nike is a fantastic company to work for overall… Everything from The Culture, Constant pursuit to improve as well as the Benefits they provide. Is definitely one of a kind… The negatives that come with working for this company however, (in the STL area specifically) is definitely the lack of accountability in the management department, lack of good leadership as well as inconsistent work practices on the production floor… Rules are constantly changing and alot of which dont make sense (Efficiency or productive wise) but are made because upper management always felt the need to modify things to keep them looking and feeling “busy”. Also when management drops the ball on doing what their title requires, they usually brush over their mistakes and either pin it on an employee thats below them, or its ignored altogether unless HR is called to get involved… Overall i would recommend anyone work for NIKE i just would encourage them to definitely make connections while in the company and stay away from any ppl who will bring negative light to your name because they do play favorites and monitor and micro manage employees who arent the best with social skills. Toxic Work Environment This is like being in middle school. There is constant drama and the main manager is hardly EVER there. Management is constantly changing and there is no sense of stability in the workplace. Certain employees are targeted more than others. It is so hard to request time off due to them not wanting to give the days off that by the time I quit, I got paid out almost 100 hours of PTO that I was not able to use when I was there. Also, you’re constantly training new people because most people end up leaving (you’re lucky if anyone stays a year at most). Very inclusive environment and the company is ALL about the employee! Working for Nike was a blessing. The benefits are outstanding, and raises were always fair, and frequent to be honest. The facility has a wonderful break area including a cafeteria, state of the art gym and half basketball court. The training was very in depth which was very helpful as well. The only bad thing was the hours. 12 hour shifts are the only thing available but many people enjoy that because you get a long weekend. The thing I did not like is that a lot of extra responsibilities were constantly being put on operators, and our feedback was rarely taken into consideration, but we we're paid decent for the requirements of the job. Also, there seemed to be a lot of favoritism within management which was a turn off. Overall it is a great company to work for if you want decent pay for a relatively easy job in the manufacturing industry. Team work Nike is a great company to work with a great team of leads and management that’s why I’m seeking to become full time and become a part of this team. Nike has great benefits and a great slogan move to the work therefore it’s always work to do they are very diverse and have a zero policy on discrimination it a fun company to work for looking forward to being a part of the team full time Fun workplace the starting pay is great. the management is great. I truly felt like I was apart of a family working at Nike! This was my first retail job. It’s a very easy going job! Very friendly and compassionate management. great discount Can’t get overtime. It's cool decent pay Theres different positions you can do so you don't do the same task every shift. You get an hour break so that's cool. And they provide a lot of hours. Awesome place to work Had alot of fun working here. It’s a great job for younger people to start off. They discount really comes in handy too. Sometimes it feels like you’re not even at work Lack of growth, direction, communication, constant micromanaging, lack of advancement opportunities, mentally draining, plus more. In short, this location is mentally draining and soul-crushing, toxic, and a terrible location to be employed. Growth is non-existent, the turnover rate is incredibly high, especially for management, extreme lack of advancement especially for seasoned athletes, there is constant lack of communication, AND miscommunication spewing from management directly. Nike as a company is a great company to work for, with PTO, a generous stock discount, mental well-being days (albeit it cannot be used the day of, but has to be “planned” in advance which is ironic in itself), paid CSL (COVID Sick-Leave which employees were paid to stay home during the pandemic for about three months, and then paid for any COVID Sick-Leave after). Otherwise, Nike itself is a great company to work for, but your experience is extremely dependent on location. The saving grace is the amazing coworkers, beyond that, there isn’t anything that’ll salvage the experience I’ve had with this Nike location. productive productive and fun work place everyone is really nice and management is really fun great workplace perks management cares and is always on top of everyone Fun and busy Nike is a job that will keep you busy with customers coming in ALL day long. Fun environment and coworkers plus great Nike benefits. Can make a career of it if you stick with the program. Nike benefits Must have good numbers…or less. Fun Great fun place to work flexible schedule. Very nice people, great opportunities. Ways to move up, good money. Nice discounts, you learn a lot. Fun atmosphere Great place to work This is a very good place to work. The discount are great and the management team is like no other. You can say if perform for anyone wanting to work in retail Great place to work Working at Nike was a good starting job. It was a Great place to work with good management. I just wished they provided more opportunities for advancement. Another Retail Job EH, its a great entry-level customer service job for like a high school graduate. The main good parts are flexible scheduling and also the employee discount. Besides that its a normal retail job Flexible scheduling, discount decent management, micromanagement, favoritism Flexible Good job while trying to go to school and might offer occasional OT during busy season if you want extra money. This is a physical job and requires you to lift heavy boxes. Management is ok but as long as you finish your work on time they will not bother you. Fun Fun Decent place to work ... really u bout the only one that can get you fired ! Air conditioned good benefits however... You gotta keep them numbers up... But it's not hard to do Fun place to work with large cafeterias Great place to work. Fun place to work with large cafeterias. Great benefits. Great pay. They will pay for your degree. They also have giveaways for Nike full time employees. Great Working Environment A solid work environment with good culture. And people that care about you and want you to succeed. I would love to do more for Nike in the future, given the opportunity. Fun workplace I've worked here for almost two years and I can honestly say I've made some of the greatest friends, built life long relationships and gained amazing skills. 4 Fun and rewarding place Fun to be part of a large company that still cares about their customer. Always something new going on, a new product or tech to learn about, a new initiative to focus on, etc. Most coworkers seem on board to improve and advance, but not at the expense of each other which was great. Great Great job big discount great people big discount great people. job work is easy depending on what you are doing. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people and gift box for Christmas. you get great giveaways. discount huge cafeteria gym favorites Terrible Management/Do not care about employees at all Very self centered management who would treat employees like trash and never be willing to work with us if we had personal things going on. Made you feel terrible for going through life. Did not care about mental health at all. Production Building in Beaverton It was an alright job. Loved my co workers and the managers were nice enough but I took it on the promise that it was a breeze to get a job at the world headquarters if you started here. It wasn't. It's also a huge pain to switch shifts. I put in a request to move from nights to days in July of 2021 and didn't hear back until March of 2022 that I likely wouldn't be moving shifts for at least another 6 months. If you have the PTO saved up your managers will work with you to get you the days you want off. Several ""floating holidays"" were provided to you per quarter that you could use to cover corporate and federal holidays in lieu of PTO. The in house lunches weren't free but they were decent quality and had good variety. They also recognize hard working employees and they do factor that in to your bonus. I was there for almost 3 years and by the end of my time there the managers and shift leads were telling me to apply for the next position up. Overall good decent working environment and good people. Good benefits, generous PTO, multiple breaks, clean, and high-tech working environment. Long working hours, difficult to switch shifts, in house lunches were pricey. Loud working environment. I love it here Awesome environment . Company really cares about their employees . The benefits are great but my favorite part are my co workers . The coworkers really can make or break your experience Fun and productive workplace Working at Nike is a load of fun. The Nike team is very helpful and expressive in a good way. The managers always have great customer service as well as great employee management skills. mid not worth it, the shifts are small, ppl get showed favoritism and everybody ends up leaving anyways, then the cycle repeats.. would not recommend long term Cool Learn a lot and it’s fun seeing some sneaker head. But man has to stay in the storage to send the shoes out which was unfair and girls can stand at the store enjoying the air conditioner For retail, it was a good place to work at It was good place to work. It can be very fast-paced that you are running around especially during the holidays. It can feel overwhelming during the holidays. It was minimum wage but you get discounts. Discounts Fine place to work as student good to have as a part time job, its easy work, get a discount (discount also counts on top of sales) its an easy low stress job but sometimes is boring when the store isnt busy Specialist It was a good place to work overall. I love the company and plan on returning but you have to be careful about which store you choose. Coworkers make the job. Especially management, they can be very lazy, coming from a former manager. Amazing benefits, top tier insurance thought Great place overall I would say that overall this place is so great to work at personally I love it here and would recommend this to anybody this job is such a great place to be Good job with management issues Job cool and laid back, they just let management get in your head like you’re doing wrong. They micromanage people & have their “favorites” they never say anything to but throw out production at the ones they don’t like. Watch out Dull job but pays well Management is good but you get tired of doing the same thing constantly. It pays well and you get great benefits though. It’s not a bad place to work temporarily. Good and balanced place to work for this company. Nice people, good culture of the company, management is the best, and many other attributes are also good for this company. I recommend anybody to join a excellent company. Fun Workplace The environment, product, and the people who worked there were the best part. It’s a very family-like atmosphere. The customers who shopped there were entitled and rude, which made the job suck. Fun Workplace Working at Nike was always a fun time. The team I was on got along very well with each other and collaborated well in any task we needed to do. It is a great place to start a retail job at. It’s ight Easy job if ur just getting started but not sun u want to stay at long term it might be for you be certainly wasn’t for me. Managers mess up pay every time too Fun High energy environment, cool management, easy going job, not very tiring. The energy in the store is on point and the staff is usually out going and social Great Work Life Balance! Complete Lack of Direction This is specific to Air MI. The work-life balance, PTO, and total benefits package are excellent. Management is a huge issue at the company. Most leaders are absent and disconnected from day to day operations. So much work is contracted out to third parties that it has become hard to understand what the company does internally. The lack of internal expertise has turned any decision making into an impossible task. There is a bizarre amount of overstaffing and understaffing in different departments. Senior leaders rotate through very frequently ensuring no major goals are achieved. Individuals at the company are very supportive and there is a strong sense of equality in the work place. I've rarely heard of a manager yelling at their employee. Overall, the work-place is healthy but the quality of work is lacking. Benefits, Work-Life Balance, Community, Safe Space Strong lack of organization and direction"
Electronic Arts|" Great Place to work A great work/life balance and welcoming community. The employees are there to help and not to withhold information in the name of competition. If you are passionate about video games, this is the place for you Excellent if you like video games Work is fine, the community is great and the management is pretty good. I learned a lot about how a video game and its development works. It is a nice activity, but is hard to advance and the salary is not really the greatest. Interesting activity Hard to advance 1 Awful CEO and awful company. Good and kind co-workers badly paid overworked CEO makes bonus pay and doesn't pay it's workers to match the cost of living. No room for advancement and if you quit to come back you can somehow advance. Feedback is non-existent or just odd when passed up for promotion. Maybe it was a good place at the start but it's a shell of it's former self. Request time off easily, insurance was decent. Pay, lack / poor management, no room to advance. 2 Great place! Wonderful place to work, loved the main campus and loved our products. It was an energizing environment and they offer flexibility as well. Great leadership and a great place to work. Fun workplace Pros: Lots of fun social activities, inclusive work environment, cares for employees' work-life balance, support flexible work model (full remote is allowed), supportive management Cons: everything (e.g. culture, compensation) can vary per project you work on Decent place to work EA is a decent place to work. It is a large company, so expect the usual large company pros and cons. Monetary compensation isn't the best, but the benefits are excellent. Benefits, diversity, large onsite gym, decent cafeteria (not free!) Lower pay than market avg for the area, company leadership sometimes does things that doesn't make sense. Nice place to work with talented people There are so many talented people working there to make good games. It offers a great number of opportunities to learn and grow. But as it is a big corporation, you need to deal with bureaucracy. Sanse minime de promovare, colegi extrem de badarani, invadarea spatiului personal, regim strict si alert de munca Ti se cer foarte multe pentru bani putini, area owners cat si managementul este deficitar, te muncesc foarte mult, te preseaza constant. Sanse minime de promovare, daca nu-ti faci un ""prieten"" care sa fie prin management sansele tale de promovare sunt aproape nule, durata pentru a promova este extrem de mare. Nu recomand, mai bine va orientati catre altceva, este pierdere de timp. Anumiti colegi sunt efectiv badarani, fac bully si injura constant, li se permite asta de catre management pentru ca se cunosc intre ei. Nimic poate doar asigurarea medicala Pauze scurte, volum de munca mare, ritm alert, foarte multe cerinte, bani putini, sanse minime spre nule de promovare, plus durate extraordinar de lungi pt promovare. 4 stars What is the best part of working at the company? - very flexible in terms of moving teams to gain skills - some teams are great in that they want to see you succeed within the company - supportive coworkers What is the most stressful part about working at the company? - sometimes long hours during certain periods - management can be hit or miss; either they really support your growth or don't care 3 stars What is the best part of working at the company? People and gifts received on occasions What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Targets and bad management What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Relaxed work environment Plenty opportunities to grow There is always lots of opportunities to take on new initiatives based on your interest. Plenty of opportunities to work on big scope projects. Overall they encourage you to achieve your career goals, and the managers will set up clear path to help you level up by creating opportunities for you to make the case. Diversity is great. Very flexible remote working policy. Ok place to work. Get to work on some exciting projects. There are periods of crunch that are not very pleasant. Compensation is on the low side. You do get to work on interesting projects with generally very competent co workers. Great work life balance The company provides opportunities for career growth and they really invest in their workers. There is a lot of flexibility in working and there is mobility within the company to work with different teams, but stay within the company. Overall the company is great, the people are great, and the employee experience is great. Amazing place to work! Great work environment and culture. One of the best jobs I have ever had....loved working there! I loved all aspects of my job. Working at EA was a dream job. You get to work with an amazing group of people that become family. Work is fun, does not feel like work. Long hours but they take care of you. I worked there for about 5 years before being laid-off in 2008 due to outsourcing. One of the best jobs I've ever had! Fun environment, learned a lot and made a lot of friends. nothing really, long hours when we had to meet deadlines, but it was fun and they bought us food and snacks. We were spoiled! No cons :) very epic to work at Overhead management expecting things even themselves were not able to do. I would get amazing numbers in terms of getting the line moving, orders out and perfect for each customer, and made each person’s experience the best I possibly could. But I would be told “labor” was too high if I was excelling. Then if I cut back on labor by sending workers home early, I would get admonished for orders taking too long to get out. This only ended up happening when they switched general managers of my store and changed ownership to a new company. Great place to work! My manager cares about me as a person. Teammates are fun and very friendly. Work hours are very flexible. The benefits are great as well. Numbers of PTO are accruing from your start date. Avoid I worked there for one year and I was really excited at the beginning but after a while I realised it was not what i was expecting. Job was super-stressful and you have to deal constantly with angry kids or abusive parents. For the first time in my life I had Stress-related illness and apparently it was ok for the company since they constantly have many cases like mine. Do not apply just because of the name of the company, it won't be fu and you won't be really into videogames. Managers are probably the worst part, none of them have an economy/business/management degree, so the result is that people do not last longer than a year. decent salary, free games unexperienced management, careless people, huge amount of work Trash tier company, working as a CS rep was miserable I did enjoy being around some of my co-workers, the few very cool ones, but the majority were incompetent, management was completely incompetent, there was no room for advancement, pay was marginal. Fun and engaging work place I get paid to test a video game. It is literally every kids dream. Unfortunately it’s only contract work but it’s an enjoyable experience to say the least. Fair pay Work from home because of Covid Nice temporary job My time at EA was short but overall a good experience. I worked night shift during my time in undergrad and it was a vey chill environment. Overall it was a nice beginner job. Great people, with some exceptions The staff and management for the most part were great. There was a toxic senior manager that was brought on board and allowed to thrive to the detriment of others but now he's gone. Great Place to work A great work/life balance and welcoming community. The employees are there to help and not to withhold information in the name of competition. If you are passionate about video games, this is the place for you Enjoyable place to work, where the mission is having fun while creating fun and entertaining content people enjoy Collegial environment where creativity and entertainment are on the menu every day, and diverse backgrounds and perspectives are valued, as is the role each person plays, big or small, in getting a product from concept to gold master. Employee store, Games Amazingly talented people Most recently worked from home so really only interfaced with my manager. GREAT company, kind, understanding manager! I loved working at EA Tiburon, VERY impressed! Flexible schedule None Terrible place to work. Terrible place to work. The company runs on a culture of “this is how we’ve always done it” and isn’t innovative at all. Senior Leadership are more concerned with their own compensation. Fun start in game development This job for the most part is really fun. Only drawbacks are limiting you to 3 month contracts with the potential to get extended for a year. max 3 contracts. Also the management and promotions are all over the place. Things are EXTREMELY unorganized but I guess for what the job is its fine. Hard to promote within at a contract test center I learned a lot of critical test skills here, but I had too move on. There's definitely been favoritism at times. Hard to get QOL improvements for the whole studio. Always ""two weeks"" Fun work staff Hard to promote within at a contract test center Fun environment but limited opportunity for advancement This review is actually for the distribution center in Louisville, KY. It is a fun environment to work; however, the opportunity to move up is extremely limited. Pay is average and benefits are pretty decent. I learned a lot during my time there but left because there was no room for advancement from my role as a team leader. Fun environment, good benefits, free/discount video games Long hours during peak, limited advancement opportunities Not good for contractors I was a contractor and often I felt like a 3rd world employees. We get no benefits or time off. The team I was on was a horrible team and everyone only cared about themselves. Never again will I work here Pay and close to my house and the cafeteria Everything minus the pros Lack of Support to Employees While I worked for EA the system changed so many times we never really knew for sure who the manager was at any moment. The support tools themselves where a mash up of a bunch of old and new systems that didnt interconnect that many times people could easily play the system for free merch. Over all it was a frustrating experience. None You are not valued Loc munca fara viitor A fost o experienta minunta pana cand a inceput sa imi provoace o greata nemaintalnita deoarece sunt foarte stricti cu pauzele(mersul la baie). Lucrul in echipa nu este la fel cum ma asteptam. Lumea te critica indiferent de caracter. Superiorii sunt aroganti si bagaciosi. Te avanseaza rapid Te dau afara dupa avans Fun, relationships based work environment with good people Working at EA is good overall. The best part about it is the culture and the work-life balance, but since I don't work in a studio, this might be different for others. Management is not malicious but can be short-sighted. Needs more resources put into employee advancement. Great people, fun job. Not a lot of skill building opportunities. Fun and Productive Company You will definitely enjoy and thrive you truly want to make a mark in the gaming industry. I had a short stint in the company but nevertheless it inspired me to give my best Work Environment The people at this studio in Baton Rouge, Louisiana are great people to work for. I never seem so many people who's passion about what they love to do on a daily base. EA was not a company I would want to work in long-term Working at EA was very structured and agile, however, it felt too much so. Layoffs felt regular and products seemed iterative. The learning curve was very steep, and 60 hour weeks were common. Avoid contract roles at all costs A great company to work for, if you have a regular full-time position. Extremely frustrating if you are a temp/contractor. Upper management struggles with decision-making and cares very little about the average worker. Great place BUT.... Contracts last between 3 months to 12 months. After the 12 months you have to wait 3 months to reapply. Cannot work more than 3 contracts. Good for PT or trying to make extra money but this is not a career and they will let you know that. Productive and fun place to work I worked for EA for a little over a year and a half. The work itself was usually rewarding and interesting. The culture is shifting though and many roles on the retail level are being phased out making g advancement difficult Productive and Easy place to work at, with a friendly culture For my first industry job this was a blessing of a place to work at. The employees are extremely friendly, patient, and talented. Everyday things got done no matter the tasks that were at hand. Benefits were great and they really understand work life balance. Austin location One of the best work experiences I've had in my adult life. Everyone is so open and willing to be there for one another. the CEO's and upper management do their best to know everyone they can on a personal and first name basis and it's greatly appreciated and doesn't go unnoticed. There is always constant movement around the building when it comes to making sure lower level workers have everything needed to be comfortable in their positions. Think twice and resist the temptation It's not all fun and games working at a gaming company. A lot of us grew up playing EA games and that sense of nostalgia pulls hard when considering a role there. My advice is to think twice about what you are looking for and be truthful with yourself about if EA will help you get there. While the company looks cool from the outside, with wonderful artwork throughout all of the offices and some interesting internal teams (like SEED and CREATE). It's all a facade on top of a very traditional (and conservative) company. A great example - they think they are an agile firm, but really they operate in a very waterfall nature with some agile ceremonies. The hardest part is that they are very anti-data-driven. Data is in silos and hard to access. When you can get access to some data you need, it's almost impossible to correlate with data from other parts of the organization. Managers claim to be data-driven, but when reports show them something they don't like they just ask for the query/algorithm to be adjusted so the results will match their world-view. They are also overly-collaborative. Meaning your annual bonus is based on the subjective nature of how people view and think about you. Just a few people who think you are ""rocking the boat"" or challenging their role can sink your review. Managers pick favorites and unevenly allocate bonuses accordingly. Good pay. Otherwise a black hole for passion, innovation and accomplishment Great office, location, pay and perks. But they need all of that to make up for the total and complete $hitshow the entire company is. Everything is great until the moment your recruiter hands you off to the people you actually work with. Great Place to work A great work/life balance and welcoming community. The employees are there to help and not to withhold information in the name of competition. If you are passionate about video games, this is the place for you Laid back, good environment, hard to advance The day consists of doing tasks to make sure functions in the Apex Legends game are working, adhoc and writing bugs, 3-hour playtest where you play the game as it's intended, and retesting bugs (specific night shifters only). When performing tasks, you will need to talk to other testers and ask for their help (eg verifying something looks ok in third person). By talk, I mean you use a chatting service called Slack. Sometimes the other person isn't paying attention, so you have to tell them in person. Pros: This is a nice laid-back job where you can sit in front of a computer and test games. - Free coffee and fresh fruit - 1 hour lunch break where you can do anything (eg play Smash or watch videos online). Fridge and microwave in break room. Frozen food and snacks can be bought as well. - Low entry ceiling - No manual labor or standing required. You get your own desk (may have to share with a day/night shift person) - Testers are really cool, and most of them are anime and gaming nerds - Friendly towards women. Bathrooms also have pads. - Zero tolerance towards harassment. If your coworker is harassing you, just report to HR - You are making a huge difference in the Apex game, and you can offer feedback to make the game better (surveys) Cons - The contract is 3 months long. After your contract ends, you have to take a 3 month break (called ""furlough"") before starting a new contract - There is a limit of 3 contracts. After 3 contracts here, you can't come back. This is a new thing that started in 2019 ""behind the scenes"" without telling the testers specifically. 2 Royalty Accounting Department Full of Politics, Lack of Work About 13 employees in the department, but with a true workload worthy of perhaps 7-8 (people), hence a 60% or so true workload. While this is a ""good"" thing in terms of having plenty of time for a healthy personal life and work balance, it's a bad thing in realizing their dysfunctional work culture is not about doing good work, instead it's a work culture that awards being talented at pretending there is more work than there is, and how proficient you can be at deflecting any new or additional work. Superb campus and benefits Fun and Exciting Workplace A typical day involves building the files, playing the game, and checking ofn task performance. The culture was great as their is a game/break room and its very collaborative. The hardest part of the job for me was sometimes the equipment didn't work or headsets were missing. Also, it was difficult to find other testers to collaborate with. I enjoyed working with other creative individuals who were animation experts or game fans. Highest Paid CEO = doesn't properly pay employees compensation here is horrible run far and fast, There is no room to move up within the company at all for the most part. There is no proper career plan in place, and often times people have to leave the company to get promotions. driving from place to place work independently....I learn how to put up ceiling fans...put in plugs..etc….never around management...hardest thing is cleanin up...enjoyable going on top of the room Great team! I had fun while there. Can't complain as I worked with a talented team of individuals and was given the opportunity to learn. Everyday we were given the opportunity to work on something new. Limited I worked there from 2011 to 2019 on a 12 on 3 off contract basis. They SILENTLY instituted a 3 contract limit April of this year and have started 3 month contracts. Very Relaxed Atmosphere Everything about this job is awesome. Not to sound mean, but Electronic Arts spoils their employees. You have a fixed Monday through Friday schedule, and the hours are the same everyday. There are opportunities for overtime as well if you are on a team that constantly needs it. The only cons are that the job is contracted for one year, and although you are off for holidays, the company doesn't pay during that time. The only paid time off opportunities employees receive are during uncontrollable weather conditions that disable all or most employees from going to work. Break room, hour lunch breaks, ten minute breaks every two hours, great people. Limited time contract, no paid time off. Fun culture, no significant advancement The culture is fun, but annual raises are minimal and base pay for several positions is no longer competitive. It's difficult to advance - the culture around advancing in the company is a strange one, based on ""internal internships"" called ""secondments"". You perform in the job role that you hope to move into with no pay increase, and after 6 months, a year, a year and a half in some instances, you must still interview for the position against external candidates. Keep in mind, secondments can be terminated at any time, so if you've been in a secondment for a year and a half, your performance has been exceptional - still, no guarantee that you will be moved into that role. This is a great place to build skills and gain some valuable experience, but more doors seem to open externally than internally with that experience. It was a fun and welcoming work place that did have its confusing and stressful moments at times. I earnestly can say that the people I've met there are wonderful, friendly, and great to work with, but management took a plunge after a while, and project direction was never really set in stone. Communication between the team was limited to just direct messaging other employees to figure out what was going on most of the time. This was my experience with day shift, and it seems like night shift was better off with more management-tester communication. Free Coffee, 15 minute breaks every 2 hours, an hour lunch every 4 hours Hard working and casual environment, but be prepared for long weeks Electronic Arts is full of talented and hard working people, but while they do their best to keep you out of the office more than necessary there will be times where you have to put in the extra time needed to make the best game possible. That said, being able to come into work every day in shorts/jeans and a t-shirt helps take a lot of the stress off. You can be comfortable while you work those long days. Great place for entry-level careers and early development. Job culture is fun, with lots of engagement and Employee Resource Groups available. Advancement opportunities are lacking at this juncture, as specific Orgs mature and new skill sets are needed - it's becoming more and more likely for external candidates, rather than internal hires, to move into open positions within some Orgs within the business. Pay and compensation are lower-end for Tech and Media companies - the video game industry is growing exponentially, but salaries do not tend to meet this growth when compared to trends of similar industries. Company Culture Needs To Change The culture at EA is very top heavy. Execs aren't attune to the every day experience for their employees. They make decisions for employees without understanding the intricacies. They speak a lot about change, with no actual change being made. Not a great culture for women either. Great Job in Entertainment Working for Electronic Arts was deeply engaging and truly inspiring due to the creativity that is forced on its employees to guarantee we’re making a high quality game that seeks to entertain their fans as well as those simply testing. Being able to be a part or a massive team of developers and creators adds a layer of understanding when it comes to building something from the ground up to be enjoyed by those seeking to be entertained. It wasnt bad Overall a good company to be such a giant! The most enjoyable part is that your working on video games with great people. The worst was how corporate they have become you loose the great development feel. Fun Work Environment and Well Appointed Campus After 12.5 years working at EA, I can honestly say I have enjoyed my work experience here. I know there are many rumors out there about a total lack of work/life balance at EA. I have never found that to be the case at all. There are crunch times as in any company, but the rumors in my opinion are greatly exaggerated. The Redwood City campus includes day care, a well appointed, fully staffed fitness center, coffee bar, 2 cafeterias, bocce ball court, and video and arcade games throughout the campus. Awesome place to work Tiburon was a great place to work. Lots of amazing people to collaborate with and learn from. Benefits were great, and a lot of company and team building events hosted regularly at the studio. Worked through third party I worked through a third party employer doing customer service for EA's Legends remote customer service team. I have little experience with the actual culture or experience of working for Electronic Arts Working at EA. During my time at Electronic Arts, I happened to enjoy myself. The people were great to be around, and there was a lot less drama than one would expect at a place that requires Quality Assurance testing. I worked with some amazing people, and the things I learned from there, like how to pay even closer attention to detail, will really pay off for me in the future. Great Work Environment, Decent pay, Learning Experience Great company Awesome place to work. lots of great people who work hard. I have worked for several big companies and enjoy the culture here the best. Laid back and let's us just work instead of worrying about small stuff. Benefits are great Great Place to work A great work/life balance and welcoming community. The employees are there to help and not to withhold information in the name of competition. If you are passionate about video games, this is the place for you Poor pay, Cool culture Working here was great in the sense that the work itself was interesting and engaging but the pay is just way too low. Having to be forced to take a furlough because the company wants to avoid paying insurance and benefits to regular full time (RFT) employees so we work as contractors. Avoid if you're looking to advance quickly and aiming to make any sort of livable wages on. Work culture, experience Minimum wage, almost no advancement 7 Fun workplace in ever changing field. You come in and your day is what you make it! You can either treat this as a job, or a professional career. Understand the gaming industry on a deeper level, experiencing E3 for the first time thanks to EA! Managers want to see you succeed, however they ask that you invest your time wisely in your career. If you slack off and only give half the potential you will not thrive here. It truly is what you make it. EA promotes active change everyday, offering a multitude of events to participate in. ERG's are a fantastic way to add extra depth to your time with the company. Allowing you to meet others that you normally would never come in contact with! With every career comes it's challenges. It's how you handle that adversity that defines your character. The most difficult part can be drawn back to self-reflection, identifying your own areas of opportunities. Then having the desire to improve those areas and being the best version of yourself every day. Being in management myself I enjoy seeing my co-workers take new steps in developing themselves in and outside of the office. You get a sense of pride when you witness this, it brings you closer to the success that you look for in yourself, propelling you forward. 2 Company is all talk Doesn’t care about employees whatsoever. All about bottom line and making money for the top 6 people in the company. Fired thousands of employees with no warning and is outsourcing jobs to India. Pit of snakes Management never knew what to do, policies changed all the time, not about helping customers, hard to adapt to what they want from you. I felt miserable in the last few months there, as I couldn't get out of the role they put me in. I knew they were gonna get rid of PC/MAC tech support, and ultimately they fired all of us. No drug test, free games, some cool people People try to hold you back, metrics and policies constantly changing, unhelpful management Great culture! There is a disconnect between senior management and front line employees. There isn't clear direction from senior leadership. The people you talk to every day in your role are like family, but departments are very siloed. The pay is not comparable to the industry standard for the work you do, and work/life balance is nonexistent for most. Medical benefits, stock and 401K options, discount programs work/life balance, lack of leadership cool place to work. It was like working on the the set of the movie gramas boy. So cool. Got paid to play video games all day. I would wish this job on anybody. such a cool experience Terrible company Incompetent managers, constant restructuring, unprofessional directors, lack of organization.. Good vision, but their duty to the player failed long ago, and their duty to even their own employees has been failed as well. Ea Working at EA was very educational on the gaming side of the industry. The marketing partners are very strategic and I enjoyed my time with the company. The company with the most awful customer support I worked at EA customer service. No part of the job was intended to help customers, we just try to get rid of them as soon as possible. Awful company. none long hours, awful management Unique and diverse company but with areas to improve upon Working in the video game industry is demanding, but it can be very fulfilling. The company as a whole is great with great benefits, a fantastic culture, and great people. However, each team operates at a very individual level and seeing the company as one whole unit is a struggle. On the good days, we are praised, and on the bad days, leadership makes sure you know it; but again, this is team dependent. Culture, Benefits, People Work/Life Balance, Management, Turnover, Many Reorgs Productive Can feel fast-paced but there is a pretty good work-life integration culture there. There is a low reimbursement amount for those people who want to go back to school. Ea was an awesome compnay to work for I loved for that working company all the guys were super friendly and we always met are deadlines. It was really busy during deadline time but the down time made up for it. It was one of the most fun places I have ever worked at. super fool staff Deadlines were stressful. Stockholder/Board Pressure limits EA's potential The majority of the company is full of hard-working, smart and passionate people (mostly gamers) that have a strong desire to make EA a great place to work and to make great games to play. That said, the majority of stumblings from the company come from pressure to continue short-term revenue that EA has previously enjoyed, vs long-term marketplace position/strength. This doesn't impact day-to-day work for most, but does impact final products and strategic decision made for dev cycles. Dont care about customers If you want a job helping people, then look elsewhere. Many calls recieved each day about customers being treated unfairly. Our job was to get them off the phone as quickly as possible then laugh at them after. Nothing Everything The job is misleading when it comes to advancement Everything dealing with promotion or higher job opportunity was always vague. They gave tester a dollar raise when you return to a temp job. If you got hired permanently you may not get a raise. I was promoted assistant test lead no raise. Yet to employees returned and made more money than me with less job responsibility. Discounts on products Getting to and from work may be difficult from the east bay. Fun place, fairly repetitive work Great work environment with happy, energetic people. Also very cool up to date offices, it is a game development studio so theres all kinds of gaming software surrounding you. Management is solid and the pay is decent enough. Nice little office job if you're looking for full time contract work. Contracts are annual and you have the ability to renew them, which many people do. Excellent place to work The cool thing about working in this industry is that you work with people with the same interest. And when working on a team towards one goal, you feel important. It's also surprisingly mature for a work place. Not only can you raise concerns with management, but they'll actually look into it. Overall, excellent experience. Not very professional managers The executives at the company when I was there were not very professional. There were rumors about some of them that wouldn't bode well in in today's #metoo movement. The mid-level leaders/managers did not have very professional management skills and abilities. The company performed well, but not because a clear strategy was communicated across the company Exciting, tech focused. Long hours. This was my dream job. But the late nights and long hours, and the three different positions I held simultaneously became to stressful to manage. Ending in mass layoffs when the company pulled out of their contract with AOL Exciting, creative development of games. Long hours, stressful If you do drugs work at EA game testing sounds like fun until you're testing candy crush or hidden object games for 40 hours a week. You do get an employee discount but that doesnt necessarily make 9$/hr a living wage, particularly within Baton Rouge. no drug tests boring work Great Place to work A great work/life balance and welcoming community. The employees are there to help and not to withhold information in the name of competition. If you are passionate about video games, this is the place for you Good benefits, poor everything else Benefits are good but compensation was not competitive for my role. Managers often seem unaware of project status and take a lot of time off. Job security non-existent, they will replace you with someone cheaper at the first opportunity. Good benefits Everything else 6 Easy job, low expectations, little room for advancement Compensation is bad and benefits non-existent, but it was a very easy job with extremely low expectations. It's an entry-level job with an extremely low ceiling. Very little opportunity for advancement. Very easy work Poor pay, little room for advancement 5 1 Its fun if you're on staff, sucks if you are a contractor. Its fun if you're on staff, sucks if you are a contractor. The corporate culture is great. However if you are a contractor, they keep dangling conversion in front of you but never grant it. Ea It used to be fun, however, with many new inexperienced executives, everything changed; this why many long-time employees left. Unfortunately, if management doesn't pay attention to whom they hire in an executive position this will be the expected results! A stable understanding workplace Leads are highly understanding of external work circumstances and will often allow employees to go outside of the already flexible schedule with enough advance notice. While some of the work might be tedious, the relaxed and friendly atmosphere helps the time go by. Flexible but reliable scheduling Somewhat repetitive work EA is a video game company and as a technical support advisor you will have plenty of fun, but work it is still a call center. Phone, email, and chat supported environment to help players back to enjoying their games. The tough times are when there are issues that are not able to be resolved upon a first contact. Management has gotten better about being pro active about helping fellow employees with a career path. Also the upper management seem to have a buy in to help with career development as well. The most enjoyable part for me is the events that EA has like launch parties with plenty of food and drinks for each game that comes out. The benefits are nice as well good health plans. Health benefits, Gaming company, Company events Call center, tough customers, It can be tough to move into the game development industry from this position Committed To Great Employee and Customer Experience EA's commitment to a great employee and customer experience is evident in everything they do. They start by genuinely listening to the voice of the customer/employee, digesting the information and making changes that create unique experience. Working for a company who truly values your ideas, experience and suggestions is invaluable. Beat place to be!!! Managment helps you adavance your career, relevant training to keep you up to date on changes. Fun and laid back atmosphere. Amazing place to be! Always a party happening Cheap snacks. Half off merchandise Cold Only worth the experience to get you to another position To specify, this is for the Baton Rouge Testing Facility. Get in, get your experience, and get out as fast as you can. This location does not offer professional growth. At first this seems like the perfect job. You're working on video games but that's where the good qualities end. First and foremost: This is a low cost facility. The bulk of the work force is made up of contract testers that are forced to take a 3 month furlough after 12 months. This means that after 12 months of work, you are unceremoniously laid off for three months. They are constantly trying to find more friendly ways of saying this but it doesn't make it any better. Getting a full time position comes down to who you know, not how you perform. If your boss likes you? You may get a promotion. This leads to an unhealthy and unfriendly environment where people are more concerned about sucking up and trying to befriend their leads instead of doing their job. Zero job security or chances of promotion: Currently the location is not back filling any full time positions. If a full time employee is fired they back fill the position at one of their many foreign offices. When questioned about opportunities for increased compensation, the management here has gone on record saying that their pay rates are competitive and that you're taking the pay they offer for the opportunity to work in the gaming environment. That is all the compensation they believe you deserve. Get experience in the gaming industry Everything else. Bad work environment, poor management, Contract work, HR cares about protecting themselves from being sued not about the employees Great place to work. I worked as a contractor for this company. I enjoyed every minute of working there. I was give lots of opportunity to learn things to advance my career. I will be looking forward to continuing my career with this awesome company. Free Coffee Break Room Great work life balance but no clear direction The company tries its best to move toward a more modern approach but lacks the execution and direction. Decisions are waterfalled down from exec level without instructions on impact and goals. Okay Company It was an alright company. only worked there for one contract term of 6 months or little less. Good environment with some decent people. not the greatest pay. Perfect Love it HereI have been working at Electronic Arts full-time (More than a year). Lot of learning opportunities, get to work in the gaming industry. Software testing for Video Games is a good way to break into the industry. Great vision The company is a leader in the gaming industry and changing the way we interact with video games. The company is driven to produce results and provides a substantial compensation package. Bad place to work EA Sports is a division of Electronic Arts that develops and publishes sports video games. Formerly a marketing gimmick of Electronic Arts, in which they tried to imitate real-life sports networks none none Fun work environment with advancement oppurtunities Learned valuable skills used for bug detection in games/mobile apps in a fun, relaxed work environment. Friendly and informative co-works and team leads allow for expedited learning where applicable. Exciting atmosphere of extremely talented artist committed to excellence During my time working for EA I was involved in many different aspects of multiple exciting titles. I was given the opportunity to expand my skillset into multiple areas of expertise including: Modeling, Texturing, and Animation. I enjoyed my time spent there and would do it all over again if I could. amazing facility, exciting titles, and latest technology. Located in a very expensive part of the country which made raising a family difficult. Enjoyable place to work, but never any raises. This could be a great company to work for if they would re-balance their pay structure. Working there full time is not enough to even make it on your own, and with a 3 month layoff between contracts it leaves you in a bind every time. Great atmosphere and people. No raises and very little room for advancement. Very productive work place with a lot hardworking and fun people. Most work days consisted of adjusting the temperature/HVAC vents for at least one or more co-workers. LOL!! The people were incredibly smart, fun and creative making it a pleasure to work with them. I always felt appreciated for my contribution. I learned a lot about the gaming industry and how piracy impacts gaming and other industries. I learned that producing a quality video games takes months/years of planning, executing and testing. I witnessed the demands of the job sometimes take its toll on artists, programmers and testers. The company management worked hard and played hard. They were dedicated leaders that walked beside their teams every step of the way. The work place culture could be extremely stressful at times and an absolute blast! The people and seeing the final product release. One of the funnest work environments I've ever experienced. Alpha dates could be brutally stressful. Miserable work with deceptive hiring process Working at EA is a lie. I was hired as a contractor and wasn't actually given the benefits I signed up for, and the company that hired us out as contractors provided none of the benefits I was expecting from EA, which were necessary for my health needs. I was forced into a position that I specifically said I didn't want and was unable to move until the end of the project, and was frequently criticized by my manager for my personal skills. Casual dress, frequent voluntary overtime Deceptive benefits, unstable employment, little opportunity for advancement"
Nasdaq, Inc.|" Intern Experience Overall a lot of learning opportunities. The office was very dull except on two days of the week as the company was hybrid. The best advice is to connect with those within the employee network groups who get most of the funding for events. No clear path to advancement; lack of teamwork; The senior leaders pitch this concept of ""Nasdaq Family."" The reality is that you never no when you will be let go. If you are always looking behind you, you will never see what is in front of you. It would also be great to see more diversification w/in the org at senior levels. The most difficult part of my job is dealing with an SVP who doesn't seem to want to listen to the staff (which hinders the entrepreneurial spirit) Below Average Pay - No Work-Life Balance - Very Corporate - Prioritises Money over Tech - Below Average Pay - No explanation necessary - No Work-Life Balance - No explanation necessary - Corporate - No explanation necessary - Prioritises Money over Technology - This is reflected in planning and pay for employees - Massive Technical Debt - Related to the point above - Require 24-7 Availability - Frequent Weekend work - Frequent calls in the middle of the night - No explanation necessary Highly driven, expect to be challenged While at Nasdaq I've worked on easier and harder roles, but always there is opportunity for excellence. The company runs lean and it is easy to get in a cycle of delivering, leading to more concurrent expectations, leading to more chance to deliver. At a certain point you find your work group has a recurring joke about working Saturdays and that vacations don't exist. The vacation benefits are pretty good, but it is tough to take them. Productive A Technology Company that continues to drive new ideas and innovation. A company that welcomes a fresh set of eyes from summer internships. A leader for diversity and inclusion. Diverse environment More Stream lined communication between various departments Great company When I was there we were a family and all worked together. 9/11 did change the dynamics of company but it was still a good place to work. Would recommend. Accommodating, willing to work with employees, listening to employees Couple areas in company very clicky and difficult to work with, classify those individuals as check collectors which every company has. Outstanding allowing flexibility during the pandemic. Very inclusive company that goes out it's way to make sure all groups are recognized and appreciated. Strong management team that makes every attempt to keep the focus of markets and market technology at the forefront. Excellent benefits. Overall compensation is good not great. Global brand with a good reputation. Professionally managed. Politically correct/woke almost to a fault. Always something New No such thing as a daily routine, this job kept me active, never knew what was going to happen or what needed to be worked on this job required a lot of thinking outside the box and creation/learning on the fly. 24/7 support Great company culture Great company culture Managers are great and want you to succeed in your career Work-life balance was great because they understand you have a life outside of work. Good compensation In sales you are stack ranked and there is lots of pressure but also good compensation for hitting targets. Great cultural environment. Management isn't always able to fully support goals. Standard Robotic Lifeless Culture With Hydraulic Fluid Running Through Its Veins This is a standard big-business corporate environment where employees are encouraged to provide feedback but are afraid to speak their minds. If you prefer corporate mumbo-jumbo over real conversations, this is the place for you. Looking good in the eyes of the organization is preferred over doing any actual work. Manager meetings can be especially entertaining as the head-honcho sits at the center of the conference desk while attendees take turns either nodding their heads in agreement or nodding thier heads off to sleep as the ringmaster looks from side of the room to the other. For further reference, watch the movie ""Office Space"". It's not far off the mark. It's a job. Good for robots. Bad for human beings. Management cares about employee wellbeing Nasdaq's management responded well to Covid-19, adding wellness benefits (such as the Calm app for all employees) and providing constant communication to employees about the state of the company. The CEO was clear that no one should be forced by their manager to go back to the office. Welcoming culture and senior management that cares about employees Little room for advancement, with the exception of Technology and Product Development Wonderful people...Work overload Pros: Employees are kind and inclusive Great benefits to Staff Employees Cons: Nothing is ever enough (always needs to be bigger and better) Little work/life balance Culture is work, meetings, work, meetings....work Employees are kind and inclusive, Great benefits to Staff Employees Nothing is ever enough, (always needs to be bigger and better), Little work/life balance, Culture is work, meetings, work, meetings....work Tough environment Typical male dominated culture even with a Female President/CEO....who happens to be brilliant. Didn’t appreciate staff. You were expendable. Lot’s of lay-offs. Paid well, great benefits but not truly appreciative of staff in Shared Services positions or departments. The people were friendly and supportive Before 9-11, Overall a 4.8 out of 5 stars. After 9-11 within two years, Nasdaq decided to move to New Jersey. We saw a lot of New Managers who would not give you the time needed and they thought they knew it all. They looked down their noses and even said you don't know what you are doing. The programs that were written in house changed with the new way of trading took over. A lot of very smart people working nonstop At Nasdaq you will work with some of the smartest people you have ever worked with, but you will work nonstop. Your out-of-office email will be ignored, your vacation time means nothing. Nasdaq hires the most talented people they can find and runs them into the ground. Why people stay as long as they do I have no idea, but I've been there about three years and it's all I can do to not walk off the job every day. You will check you work email morning, noon, and night and your supervisors will think nothing of emailing you at 6 a.m. asking to have something to them by 8 a.m. They will think nothing of scheduling calls on weekends and holidays. One Sunday I was on a work conference call while driving to my mother's memorial service (to be fair: I had not told anyone at work my mother's memorial service was that weekend, I would have likely been excused from the call if I had, and these weekend calls are rare but frequent enough to be enraging). I've had the opportunity to work with brilliant people on some amazing projects, but there is zero work/life balance and anyone who objects is told Nasdaq is not for them. smart co-workers, exciting projects zero work/life balance, chronic understaffing at all levels, diminishing resources to fix things Surprise layoffs I was hired as a contractor for 6 to 8 months and on end of year 2019 I was rushed out . The manager I worked under was hard to figure out. He would constantly tell me that the floor he was on that day was his exclusive space. Often I would have to move to another building nearby. Worst Place So Unorganized This is a small unorganized firm and many people that work here are miserable but paid well so they stay. I do not understand how a firm that runs this poorly is responsible for such huge trading volume and stock volume. One hand does not know what the other is doing and the management is awful, most just care about the 9-5 and pay None poor management, unorganized infrastructure, functions like it's 1980 A few The office is beautiful. There's a pool table and free food in the cafeteria everyday.They go all out for appearances. But the work environment is isolating . It's easy money if you're allowed the opportunity to do your job. There are a couple of managers that are over 40 yet remain with the high school mentality. They live by the typical female, jealousy rule everyday. If you're a typical. ice cold female you'll fit right in. The job is great. Some of the people are not. Productive time spent They had a great working atmosphere. I felt safe. Encouraged me to learn different technologies and provided a great work-life balance. It also helped me understand the organizational values. Great place to work. Friendly work environment with good pay. There are plenty of opportunities for growth if you make sure you and your work stand out. Great home/work balance sometimes allowed to work remotely from home. Intern Experience Overall a lot of learning opportunities. The office was very dull except on two days of the week as the company was hybrid. The best advice is to connect with those within the employee network groups who get most of the funding for events. Fast paced with egocentric managers It was refreshing to see the new CEO join who started as an intern. But unfortunately everybody else underneath her acts fearful of losing their jobs and results in them demonstrating older behaviors that don't engage teams. They want to be a fin-tech company but don't behave like it because they can't define their culture and prevent good performers from doing more for the organization. When showing initiative, it doesn't get the support. Good image but disappointing on the inside. productive workplace with ping pong and chess tables Work days may vary. Sometimes 40 hrs per week. However, it is possible to work more depending on group and various projects. Management looks to subordinates to keep them posted on ongoing tasks. Most enjoyable part of the job is the people. Not really about team, nepotism is the word of the year It was a dream job turned to a three year long nightmare. We had a great team and working environment that dismantled by design. Upper management had no clue of the task at hand and tried to run it like a sweat shop. The Management and HR at Nasdaq is not great. Managers with personal goals get their way because of the poor HR management. There is a lot of racism that is being exploited and loop holes are being used to maneuver around. The politics at this company is heavy. It's a very pressured environment. There can be some good experiences, but they're very small compared to cons. It's a great to have the Nasdaq on your resume, however expect to have a rough time there if you colored. Having the Nasdaq on your resume Too many to list Change Ok place to be. The company i was under was aquired at the time and this seemed to be a smooth transition. No complaints. My manager at the time was a little crazy, but made things interesting. Good product and decent people. A horribly run company NASDAQ is not a good place to work. I do not recommend pursuing a job at NASDAQ. Management is very poor and there is very little room for growth and advancement. Some flexibility with being able to work remotely Poor management, no room for advancement or growth Avoid Long hours with a management that doesnt seem to care how overloaded the analysts are. Its a very political environment that is very slow to promote. They also have no concept of on-boarding or any form of training. Despite the slow promotion/raise attitude, they typically will raise your salary by a large amount (well over 10%) once they decide to do so. Good Benefits and a Starting salary Slow to promote or raise. expect long hours. Good Company I've learned a lot and had a great managers that allowed me to grow. I've had a great work life balance. I've traveled and had interaction with all management levels. Great place to work with smart and motivated people with deep industry knowledge Great place to work with smart and motivated people with deep industry knowledge. Innovative company in both financial markets and technology industry Good Place to work Even though they sold off our division about a year after they purchased us, it was a fairly nice place to work. Not sure why they bought us in the first place. Condescending, old-school culture w/ a mix of younger, wannabe-reality-tv-show managers; witless VPs and upper execs that expect eggshell-walking staf The Times Square office is an unusual environment. It is run by a Mean Girls event staff and an endless parade of VPs that empower them. Since the workspace is shared by CNBC, employees are sometimes made to be props at their desks. Since it is also a rental place for events, sometimes you cannot do your work without retreating elsewhere. There are too many VPs wasting time calling meetings and too few staff members to help complete the mountains of work. It's an organization that boasts of lean-ness: an employee gets to do the work of two or three people. Emails, calls, texts and other forms of communication are endless over the evenings, early-AM and, of course, holidays & weekends. Employees are always expected to be on call. Many stay to do their actual work after 5. Depending on the job function, it may be a good place to work if using it as a short-term stepping stone. It's good if you are fairly young, do not value time off or disconnecting when off, and have a lot of energy. You can learn a lot and be exposed to varied experiences. Varied experiences, Not boring, Get to do high level work Never get to disconnect, Managers / Event staff that condescend, Too much work for too few employees (except for VPs) Very fast paced but good place to work This company was very fun to work for. Your always busy! My coeworkers and managers always made it fun. The pay was pretty good as well. The benefits are amazing to. 1 hour breaks You may get out a little past your scheduled time Great work enviornment NASDAQ will check the box for most of the desired qualities that applicants look for in a new employer. The only downside would be career advancement. Depending on the function and segment of the business promotions may be limited. Great company to work for Limited opportunities for career advancement My bosses where an easy going group of people I enjoyed working for. This was my first job after graduating from Keystone Job Corp. I was excited to get this position I learned to handle multi-phone lines, sort and distribute mail.shop for office equipment. Located in the District of Columbia Crowded commute Productive and supportive Assist with managing team, daily schedules and assignments, meeting, staff meeting etc. Managed database, new hires and client schedules. Scheduled meetings and training's. Pleasure to work here NASDAQ/FINRA was the dream company to work at. there were many opportunities to advance a career and management was very supportive. Always was mentoring about financial freedom and saving Great opportunity to advance Downsizing led to lay-off Cool Place to work I had one of the best experience working with Nasdaq. My dept was the most flexible dept. Learned and developed my existing skill sets. Enjoyed working at Nasdaq. Flexible Productive and fun workplace Nasdaq is a great company to work for, it was close to home, the job is stressful at times but supervisors and co-workers were willing to assist and the hours were flexible. great location Gave employees chances to learn about Stock Market as they are a competitor of NYSE. Systems were a bit outdated and needed a refresh to stay competitive Contractor The company was not the best experience that I had in my career. I thought as a whole the company was okay. However, within my department there were some issues that I didn't particularly like and when I addressed them was turned away. I would have stay longer but management was not good. You know what they say people leave there managers not the job. Intern Experience Overall a lot of learning opportunities. The office was very dull except on two days of the week as the company was hybrid. The best advice is to connect with those within the employee network groups who get most of the funding for events. Great places, great people No complaints. I was treated very fairly. There was a great team atmosphere. People genuinely cared about each other and would help each other out. There was also great expertise within the team. Hours were quite reasonable as well. Development practices were well tuned. Hard to find much to complain about. The dev team sometimes lacked proper support and planning from within the bigger company, but it was a minor issue. Work from home, great dev practices, good people, reasonable hours Maybe some lack of direction in the bigger picture on the project as a whole (minor complaint) 3 Excessive turnover, constant meetings, poor work/life balance Great benefits - 6% 401k match, and they have nice elements like paid time for volunteering (2 days each year). That said, what management is saying about the culture and what is the reality of the culture are polar opposites. Nasdaq is a meeting obsessed culture - many individuals spend their entire 9+ hours in the office bouncing from one meeting to another, only to do their real work after hours. It's not uncommon to see people online well past 10 or 11pm and back online at 6 or 7am before making it into the office. Employees respond to emails on weekends, any hour of the night, on vacations, holidays, you name it. As a result, employees are getting burnt out but continue to force the pace because of recent lay-offs and restructurings. HR has extreme turnover - you get a new HR rep every few weeks it seems. Ever since the West Corporation deal announcement, things have taken a turn for the worse. Management boasts that the organization is ""lean"" but the reality is, one person ends up doing the work of 3 people, as one other review mentioned. 6% 401k, volunteer time (2 days / year), preventative care day no work/life balance, meeting obsessed 14 Management Interesting work, found some colleagues to be intelligent and hardworking. Limited work life balance and concerns over downsizing. Decent benefits and compensation. If you enjoy doing the job of 3 people - this is it! Nasdaq does not hire a lot ... they will backfill positions vacated by previous employees. This means you will be doing the job of 3 people because NASDAQ is too cheap to hire enough hands to give you time off... Be prepared to work during your off hours / vacations and/or weekends... Coworkers are nice Management is too cheap to hire and allow employees true work life balance Fast paced environment An interesting job position that required quick decision making and quick and efficient communication with management and peers. Challenging environment that requires adaptability to change on a daily basis. Interesting work. Stressful. Nasdaq is a good place to work with some culture problems Nasdaq was a great place to work and I was able to excel. The overall culture was a bit oppressive and hindered professional growth. I enjoyed my time there otherwise. Good work environment Fun work environment. However, there is marginal room for upward growth. Many staff members are overworked. Management typically has their employees best interests in mind. Great company to work for Great company to work for; many challenging initiatives; high paced ever changing environment. Frequent strategic changes require one to be very flexible and adoptive. Great Place to Learn, Poor work/life balance Nasdaq was a wonderful place to grow and advance in my career. The opportunities I had there were amazing. But it is fast paced and extremely stressful. There are way too many meetings during the day so working after hours is a requirement. fun place and and good people to work with productive and competitive support some times at a minimum and even non existant. extremely stressfull and could shorten your life Not a position for every one rewarding as for finance and independence can be extremely stressfull Great place to work (except in HR) Great place to work except in HR. Worst run HR department you could ever work for. Clients are great overall, benefits are good, and compensation can be very good. Forget about work life balance though. if you thrive in super chaotic environments and want great, intelligent work, it's fantastic. great work, terrible leaders in HR. Other leaders throughout the organization are quite good especially at the Executive level. Good vision, and such smart people. Smart people Depends on your department Live from Times Square Working at the Nasdaq MarketSite was part events management and part live television production. Our group was responsible for producing the market open events each day. Preparing talent and C level executives to go live on television to ""ring the bell"" at the Nasdaq Stock Market"" was an exciting part of each day. Professionalism at all levels made this a rewarding experience. Lack of Clarity It's expected that companies adapt and change, but this organization can't focus on one thing for more than 3 months. Most of the key leadership expect you to work non-stop but ironically preach time off and work-life balance as key talking points. Great company, not so great work life/balance Great company, not so great work life/balance. The money is great, the top level management is great, the middle management needs works. Overall, if you like making money but sacrificing time, go for it. Great experience, corporate culture Learned many skills while working there. Corporate culture was unattractive. Very nice benefits with stock options and paid leave. Could be a lot of fun...nice balance of slow pace and high energy. Experience and perks Corporate culture Fast paced, no two days were the same. They unexpectedly closed the entire office. I was introduced to a really unique platform. It is one of the harder financial software programs that I have seen, but after investing a few hours on it, it has turned into my favorite financial software that I have used, The best part of the job was being able to do a successful demonstration via Webex of the platform. Also had the opportunity to introduce both Separately Managed Accounts and Unified Managed Accounts (SMAs and UMAs). Good pay No job security Great Job Great place to work, and grow. Very good management team, supportive and are very helpful. Definitely a great place to work. Started on K street downtown DC, moved to Gaithersburg, MD - excellent locations. Great place to work location College Intership Great place to work. Insanely smart people. Highly recommend this place to anyone. Great fun, great people. Enjoyed the many lessons they were able to teach us there. Productive and fun pace to work Great place to work - company has a solid reputation for innovation and encourages diversity. I would encourage anyone who is looking for career growth and industry experience, this is the place for them. Company pushes innovation Job security Needs approvement NASDAQ is an ok place to work at, I work in a department that's very important, but they have a lot of employees here are not worth the money they are getting paid. Its like they don't know how to work the position they are in. Most need training and some do not need to be in that position. Intern Experience Overall a lot of learning opportunities. The office was very dull except on two days of the week as the company was hybrid. The best advice is to connect with those within the employee network groups who get most of the funding for events. At the start is was a good company, then not so good I likes the company in the beginning because all the employees wanted to do the best job and help each other. Then they hires new bosses who were out for themselves and did not even care about the company. So the employees to save their job took on the attitude of the bosses. from there is was down hill. I left the company and later those bosses where let go, damage done., 5 Big Corporate environment, challenging sales culture Substantial turnover in sales and sales management. Regional sales managers are stuck in monthly sales forecasting routines and have very little strategic focus within specific territories. It's all a numbers game to them...hit the monthly figure and do it again. Don't and you're forced out the door. 1 Ineffective management and little hope to advance Not a friendly office environment. Would not recommend a friend working here under the current conditions. Exploitative and not recognized or rewarded for achievement. Profitable business but refuses to change with time Nasdaq runs a profitable business by limiting costs and buying assets. There will always be accolades to firms that do this successfully, but when you define yourself as a tech company, this will not help you grow. Nasdaq is run by prestigious, yet older, executives that do not understand the young and changing landscape of modern technology and growth. There is a clear disconnect between the top and bottom and what it takes to run these units profitably. nice place to work nice office and good people enjoyed my time and learn a lot nice managers. busy environment but supportive people workplace culture is casual but professional. beautiful office balance of life can be improved My review at NASDAQ A great place to work if you want the flexibility. I get paid mileage and hourly wage from the time I leave home until I return. They give excellent training for each survey. I enjoy working with the farmers Pays mileage and get paid whether the farmer answers the survey or not. Paid for schooling. Does not offer a vehicle and I am putting thousands of miles on my own car Fun Place to Work I work with multiple different teams and have gained a tremendous amount of both professional and personal growth. I had a great boss who always showed her appreciation for my work. I learned alot from my boss who consistently gave me motivation to strive for better sounds good to me. I enjoyed a lot. I loved my role there as a fix qa analyst. basically, my project was migration from ISE to NASDAQ Option Trading System. But time was limited so, we had to test a lot of test cases. Great Company A leader in the industry, they continue to add new solutions for their customers and compete very well with their competition. Most of this organization works well with eachother. Corporate Solutions Department is a great way to start a career Nasdaq is a great company that is constantly growing. The Corporate Solutions division is somewhat separate from the fin-tech side of Nasdaq, but it is still a good starting spot nonetheless. The benefits/compensation are competitive and its a great way to gain a deeper understanding of the markets. Great Organization to Work For Friendly environment, Sometimes Stressful Testing, and live testing scenarios. Easy and casual workplace, Early online Trading, exciting to work for a World Leader in Trading to this day. Great Benefits and bonuses Closed as their software was complete and they no longer required QA Testing. Busy, Exciting and Professional Place to Work Busy and unpredictable days, great opportunity to learn about stock market regulatory requirements and responsibilities, very dedicated and professional co-workers, Bonuses, Stock, Telecommuting Opportunities Understaffed I enjoyed working here. I did enjoy working here. If you work in the finance area be prepared for slow job advancement, rarely receiving raises and being overlooked for all of your accomplishments as a group. great people and atmosphere Slow advancment Great Place to Work Nasdaq is a great place to work. If you get into the right area there is plenty of room for growth and advancement. I enjoyed working with my team everyday. We worked long hours but it didn't seem like it because we were getting it all done as a team! Great Place to Work. Great Place to Work. Fun Workplace Fantastic experience for an intern.Co-workers were very helpful.Learned a lot about IT operations in general. Final Presentation was appreciated by the senior team Hands on technology experience No Cons Strategic Talent Acquisition environment to work in with excellent colleagues in the department The company is growing both in size and in its technological capabilities. This is a very high profile firm and a leader in its space. Very dedicated intelligent work force. Good career advancement but be weary Upper management change processed consistently. Company has gone downhill for past few years. Culture has shifted and they do not seem as organized. tough place they get their pound of flesh from you, culture is not right for most people, a lot of turn over. Senior management in it for themselves. Brand, decent benefits very lean org, overwork everyone Gained an ample amount of knowledge working at this company It is fun and learning at the same time. Improved my overall skills through working in this organization. I learned various methods to reach out for prospective clients, and communicate with them regarding the products and business. Thank You. Work place was very decent Once all the equipment was installed, there is a lot of down time and it can get pretty boring, non-stressful is nice, but I like a challenge and I like to keep learning new software and things. They were very flexible when it came for time off, but now I realize my peer just wanted the over time and always encouraged me to take time off so he could cover the hours. Easy and decent atmosphere to work in The commute was terrible! Rumors were abundant, which were not good Intern Experience Overall a lot of learning opportunities. The office was very dull except on two days of the week as the company was hybrid. The best advice is to connect with those within the employee network groups who get most of the funding for events.

Loved NASDAQ! NASDAQ is truly a great place to work. They also offer opportunity for growth, an overall empower you to be great. You receive endless training to ensure you are current on all updates, and new products. I learned a huge amount of Sales Techniques, and also Traveled for Trainings, and Team Buildings. TO work at the Exchange was truly an experience of a Lifetime that I will always value. The Hardest part of the job was not reaching the Sales Goal when you desired it most. The most enjoyable part was my colleagues, Manager, and the Quarterly bonuses we'd receive. Travel, Expenses Merger, cause too many lay offs Good to start but get out quick If the name didn't mean anything this would be a worthless company to work for, as that's the only thing good about it, the name Nasdaq on your resume. Two words: Personnel Grinder. It doesn't matter one lick about what you know, it's all about who you know. If you find yourself with a new manager who is advancing their own team agenda and you don't fit, you'll be signing up for unemployment. What a terrible company, management is *awful* Name on your resume Everything else Productive fun workplace. Lots of work culture Great Place to work as a contractor. Great pay, lots of new things to learn. Lots of independence. Great Management with a lot of patience and everybody works hard and everybody loves it. Fun interesting and loads of work. Some days really long and intense. Broadcast employees one step below janitorial staff If you work in broadcast at the Marketsite get ready for the following: NOT SO GOOD -no chance for advancement, the department is minuscule. -the pay is not bad (50-80K) but there are much higher paid employees in the financial areas of the company making 6 figures + -the control room is basically a closet, and the heat does not work when the outside temps fall into the teens and below. -they pile so much work on you that the chance for mistakes in a complex environment is very high. -mistakes are not tolerated and you will be terminated for making too many -low level management has no real control over the employees or to determine the amount of work requested from the upper management. -intimidation from upper management to be terminated is high -upper management are not broadcasting professionals and do not understand the limitations and capabilities of a broadcast studio -""make it happen or we will find someone who can"" is the mantra of upper management. -nepotism is rampant -chance that they will claim you were doing something inappropriate on your computer and use it to fire you (this happened to a colleague) -the speeches for the bell ceremonies are absurd, they basically copy and paste from the listed companies ""about us"" page Nasdaq management sound like fools when it is obvious that they really have no idea of what they are talking about. THE GOOD -pay is OK, not great but better than some places -benefits are good, Cigna is just OK not great -bonus of about 5% yearly -restricted stock awards, if you can hang in there for at least 3 yrs benefits all the stuff mention above Not innovative There is no goal or big picture. Day to day micro managing out of control. The benefits are very good but its very dull work place. High pressure environment but gives an immense experience Nasdaq is a high professional organization which poses you many challenges but there is something to learn every day. In my 3 years tenure with Nasdaq I had a great opportunity to transform it's Corporate Solution's Technology Organization and establish the team of over 135 talented technology professionals. High Pay & Compensation, great benifits Immensely Pressured and demanding environment Multimedia Project Manager Customer Service Virtual Events (Pre, Live, Post) Audio Visual Billing Training clients on platform I trained all my colleagues on the our platform. I am the most senior person on my team. I enjoy dealing with clients and their stratification is my #1 priority. Solid Organization The company is great but the advisory business is very niche and does not show room for growth. Coworkers are nice but anybody very smart moves on into better areas. Great perks as a Nasdaq employee and great benefits Benefits Limited room for growth Good work life balance Not a bad place to work. Work life balance is better than most and the compensation is good with opportunities to transfer within the company. A fun place to work with a ping pong table A typical day at work begins with me logging into my machine and reviewing my email for any potential system issue or system outages that require my attention. We also have a ping pong table where my colleagues and I play games when there is downtime. Interesting Opportunity to learn about the financial markets, the role of the participants while working for an established technology company. However, certain groups do not offer a stimulating experience, more of a quasi government slow moving organization which is beholden to the regulators and members. Dynamic Inter-national experience Not stimulating at times Great Working environment Nasdaq gives opportunities to the younger generation, they help groom and educate employees on the industry. They allow movement across departments and provide a wide array of material to be educated on. Great place The environment and co-workers were great. They take care of their employees. Where Careers Go to Die No one has ever said ""I'm so glad I worked at Nasdaq."" This company will destroy your career and your reputation. A typical day is spent staring at your computer and having zero human interaction. There is a hacker culture here, so if you aren't one of those childish mask-wearing Anonymous people, you won't fit in. They have no business or social sense. Having your work sabotaged by a coworker is considered weak and is your own fault (even if you aren't a programmer). This company has an expiration date. I can't wait to outlive it. Being forced to change careers Horrible people work here Nasdaq A typical day at NASDAQ was like most full life cycle sales jobs. Make calls, send emails, do presentations and close business. I learned a great deal about how a Board of Directors functions. The need for technology in the space and how many industries have boards that they reports to. Management was typically very hands off. Co-workers were excellent at relationship management. The hardest part of the job was getting the attention of the Relationship Managers for your specific product as there were many other internal products that they were responsible for. The most enjoyable part was learning about a new market segment and addressing a need in that segment. Excellent technology Not being in headquarters did not allow for a lot of advancement."
Tandem Diabetes Care, Inc.|" accepting fun environment Can be boring and repetitive at times. Training is paid and thorough. A very fast paced work day but the employees are treated well and everyone is willing to help. 2 Thanks so much for taking the time to share your experience with us. Productive, fun and relax environment I have worked at Tandem for over a year and love it. I plan to work here til I retire. The atmosphere is amazing, you also have the ability to work from home. Coworkers and higher ups are always willing to help This means so much to us to know that you are having such a great experience. Thank you for all that you do and looking forward to this journey ahead together! A Great Place for Software Testers to Work and Learn On the whole, Tandem Diabetes Care is a welcoming company to work for if you truly care about helping the lives of people with Type I Diabetes. The people there help and support each other so that projects and other tasks can be completed, but also to come up with (and possibly even implement) some new ideas that can improve the lives of patients. Hybrid work arrangement, predictable work schedule (with some flexibility), highly collaborative and supportive company culture, supervisors help you to grow and develop on the job Commute was to an area I had not driven to before, wish it could have lasted longer Thank you so much for sharing your experience and for all the work you did with us! Wishing you the best on your future endeavors. Productive work- wonderful co-workers! I love with the best group of people. I am a pump therapy sales specialist and tandem has taught me so much. Both professionally and personally. What a blessing it is to work here! Bonuses-on going career development Short breaks-can be lonely Needs Improvement The process of training is so fast it’s hard to feel good about assisting anybody with diabetes when you’re not ready. As with any establishment it could be better but that’s up to the company to put that effort in . Company helps those with diabetes but it is the worst company to work for I worked at this company on the Care Bears team. One person that I work with that promoted to Supervisor and the manager over the department was horrible both of them Were!! If you're in an older employee they don't like to keep you around and they put so much pressure on you and it was the worst experience ever they do not care for employees they only want to make money it's the bottom line because they tell you they want you to connect with the customer and you do that and then you get in trouble and the manager and supervisor were hypocrites and the worst management that I have worked under in my over 35 years of experience Great, but like all places, could have been better Great company with opportunities to move forward. The only issue was with the BLM movement and they blatantly told us they would not support it then decided on a DE&I committee. Favoritism. Do not have a fake it until I make it spirit. But those who can fake it, usually do make it . Great Management Management is great, there is a sense of belonging and the company really takes care of employees. One of the best companies I have worked for. There are opportunities for advancement and learning something new. coworkers pretty good the people here are great! if you like talking to customers all day this job is for you. only thing bad about this role is that hours and work schedule kind of sucks Fun exciting career with room for growth! Great compensation for the area. Tandem is a great place to work. Their pay is competitive for the Boise area. They have flex/hybrid schedules beyond COVID. The facility is top of the line. Management is a group of leaders - not bosses, very open and collaborative work environment. Many schedule options, great compensation, management, culture, and awesome values/mission statement that they truly stand behind. Benefits could be a little better but overall pretty good. Work from home (at least at the moment) with great coworkers Been here for a couple months as a temp, great for the most part. Great coworkers and supervisor, i just wish training had been more job specific. Work can be stressful on some days, but there’s great work-life balance Work from home, positive and friendly atmosphere. Training could have been longer and/or job specific Productive job. Management cares and listens to you. Friendly co-workers. It was a good place to work at despite the uncompetative pay. Really good people to work with and really good management that cares about employees. Also good benefits. good benefits. friendly-environment. good management. pay Do not recommend. The only thing that I liked about working with this company is that they are one of the few companies that offer 4/10s and 3/12s in San, Diego BUT management is really poor. It doesn't matter how much you love your job despite the pay management sucks. DO NOT WORK FOR 1st SHIFT CARTRIDGE. Supervisor and lead will ruin your life. I feel like they wake up every morning and decide to make everyone's life as miserable as theirs. Not worth working in a company with a toxic environment, low pay, and poor management. There are also no opportunity to grow because they will keep you where you are as much as they can. Medical, dental, and vision insurance are cheap, offers stocks, schedule, etc. No 401k matching, no room for growth, poor management, toxic work environment, etc. Very micromanaged The people are great for the most part. Remote work is great. Pay is fair enough. They hire a lot through temp agencies however and the hours told to you are changed almost right away, and then after that you are expected to adhere down to the second to your schedule and you don’t get any PTO or sick time. If you call in sick it’s counted against you which they don’t tell you until later as well. Nice people Micromanage fun worlplace At one time or another, an incident or a violation can happen in the workplace. It’s the people form a workplace so these occurrences are natural. When this happens, it is the general practice to fill out an employee write-up form to clearly explain and record the incident or violation. This gives your employees the chance to know what violation they have committed and how it happened. Excellent on-boarding training. Impatient HR and Management. I was appointed through a staffing agency as a Software Tester. The interview process was easy and cool. I didn't feel like they needed much from a candidate. They mentioned you don't have to worry we are going to provide you the training. The training material and the trainer was really good. For first two days I didn't get access to the training material and hence I was lagging in the training and hands on practice on the tools they use. I was worried a little that I won't be able to finish it in the given time frame. I was told that this was the first time they are experimenting with short time frame of training period hence they have buffer time included in training itself. I felt relaxed. I passed both the assessments, practical and theoretical, in the given time frame and was given some extra time to practice on the tools they use, before I would be assigned to a team. I was quite happy and satisfied with that my trainer scheduled one more assessment before assigning me to the team. I was confident as I had got enough time to practice the tools they use. On the day of my second assessment (which was not the part of the training but mutual agreement between me and trainer, so that I feel more confident) My assessment was scheduled after lunch but I got a call in the morning that Tandem no longer wanted me to continue. I was shocked what went wrong, they must give explanation for termination. How can anyone decide just in 3 weeks of period if the candidate is best fit or not? That has caused me lot of stress and made me lose my confidence. They provide good training before assigning you to the team. They fired a trainee just in 3 weeks, even before the assessment was done from their side. No explanation was given. Productive and Fun place to work Great place to work. Management is super nice and willing to help. Co-workers are great to help out as well. Most customers are nice and happy when they call. When I worked there it was remote Some customers are angry when they call Don’t work for cartridge This is a very toxic work environment. Leads and supervisor show favoritism towards others, they will expect a lot of work from you and won’t recognize any of your hard work. They only care about reaching their goal number, not so much about the quality, hardly anyone follows the work instruction, they take short cuts to everything. The pay is not worth it, you will be getting paid the same pay as people doing nothing while you’re doing the work of 3 people. Company makes a lot of money yet they’re cheap asf Potlucks, free soda machine Overworked and underpaid Great Place to work Experience varies greatly depending on your department and role. QA is rewarding here as you see the impact of your job on the product, process, and customer experience. You get what you put in, if you ask for more responsibility and have a clear direction of what you want, management will guide you there (sometimes). Education such as certificates / continued learning programs are supposedly paid for but I haven't seen it yet. Management here can be described as high level guidance and goals without micromanagement. The workplace culture is the most relaxed I've ever been a part of. Do your time, get your work done, work from home sometimes, just show results and meet deadlines. Management sometimes provides meals but mostly, the workers do potluck style lunches. Hoping Throwback Thursdays make a return (happy hour after work) after Covid. The work itself is very basic. You can skate by just doing the bare minimum and never learning anything and bore yourself for 10 hours a day doing repetitive tasks. Management will try to push tasks on you based on your abilities though and encourage growth. Best part of the job are the people! Relaxed culture, important product, growth is dependent on you Entry level daily work, repetitive tasks Growing pains but lots of opportunities I was one of my manager's first direct reports, so I initially had issues with not having clear direction and not feeling heard. However, things have improved lately and I'm getting the support I need to succeed in my role. The general concensus is that everyone in the company is stretched thin and starting to burn out. We're hiring as fast as we can, but it comes at a cost (large hiring classes that impact quality of training, new leadership like my manager, etc). Tandem does a great job of giving opportunities to those who seek them and helping them grow professionally. Pay is pretty low for entry-level positions. There's plenty of overtime available for those who want it.. Overall, this company is great to get your foot through the door and gain experience. Generous benefits package, solid company culture, lots of opportunities Heavy workload, low pay If you enjoy being busy but undervalued Beware of working anywhere in the production / manufacturing side of tandem. It can be fun working with the employees but management are not ashamed of showing favoritism here, and if they are understaffed they will overwork their team, they refuse to listen to the people who actually work on their line, and would rather produce low quality product and save money than to resolve ongoing issues and cause you emotional distress or conflict if you simply try to bring up a suggestion to improve something. Also, forget “growing” with the company if management finds a flaw in you. They hire diverse cultures but definitely treat some better than others. Yes, they will buy you $10-20 meals IF you meet their unreasonable quotas, & have a drink machine available, but instead they could use $ bonuses as an actual incentive to the workers. Unhappy employees with higher demand will produce lesser quality products. Paid lunches, vending machines, cool employees Management does not listen or care about you. Favoritism, high demands, hard to advance accepting fun environment Can be boring and repetitive at times. Training is paid and thorough. A very fast paced work day but the employees are treated well and everyone is willing to help. 2 Thanks so much for taking the time to share your experience with us. Productive but management could be better. If you were as an assembler, you can imagine that it is what you'll be doing all day. But luckily enough, you're constantly surrounded by people. If they're nice, you can make friends easy and talk because what else can you do while you're sitting down for 10/12 hours. However, management can better. There's obvious favoritism and some of them don't know what they're doing. Sometimes there's free lunches that the higher ups provide. Sometimes Free lunches, Work only 4 or 3 days of the week, Vending Machines/Soda Machine, Coffee Maker Management, People 2 We appreciate your review. This will be documented with our Human Resources team so that this can be taken into consideration. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with us. Nice coworkers, pay rate is a little low, nice work schedule (weekend-3 12 hr shifts) Pros: Job is relatively easy, free lunch when quota is met, free drinks, nice coworkers and good teamwork, good weekend schedule (3 12-hr shifts) Cons: lower pay rate compared to other companies 1 Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback with us. We appreciate your work with our team and wish you all the best on your next endeavors! Good Company Bad management Company is over all good, pay is okay, 2nd shift supervisor doesn't know what he is talking about. He is very unprofessional and talks bad about every employee. Many have been to HR he continues to be the same so if you are looking to work here Just DO NOT go to 2nd shift (Manufacturing) over all pretty good benefits and easy work Benefits, Schedule You have to put up with a bas supervisor just to keep your job Very productive and great atmosphere This company is truly the best company I've ever worked for. The culture is beyond comparable to anything I've ever encountered. This company thrives in the products and customer service it provides. Family is definitely what I would consider the feeling this company brings in comfort level. The environment is casual, and outgoing. I was definitely very proud in telling everyone I worked for this company. The best benefits I have ever had, incentives are nice and if you work hard and exceed expectations, the sky is the limit with growth. Free lunches, annual bonuses for all employees, casual setting, work from home, great management teams, amazing benefits. I think the only con I experienced was the training when transferred to a different department. The workload is extreme so they are demanding unrealistic overtime It is disappointing to work for a company with a great product, but they are growing so fast and making so much money they are not hiring enough employees to handle the work load. The salaried pay is fair, but when you work overtime (working for free) everyday that brings your salary compensation down. They have a great new facilities in Boise, IDaho, due to covid no one is there. they are using overtime as a tool to get the influx of excessive work done, huge burnout Terrible Do not work with you on scheduling. Make you choose 4 schedules you would like and you get none of them..they are hard up when it comes to time off. And don't belive in a work life balance. Awesome company! The Customer Sales Support department has really blown up, and they’re constantly creating new positions, both management and support. I really feel like there’s is so much room from growth and advancement within the company. Being in office was great, and they have worked so hard to really create the awesome company culture over teams. Recommend working here. Awesome people, free lunch, opportunity Customer Technical Support This job is a call center job though they might advertise otherwise. Management is none existent to answer any questions in a timely manner. They track you call times. You have to report to your supervisor if you need to take a break ie use the restroom. You are taking calls all day. You get two 10 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch. You are just another body to management. Most positions you go through recruiting companies because they go through so many employees. Pay is decent (16hr) Short breaks, watch your every minute move, low job satisfaction, low moral Decent work life balane. Good company to work for. the management treats you well but the job is very repetitive, I worked at the CTS role and most of the work was very repetitive. Pay, Work Life unrewarding Easy work, good pay, kinda boring Once you understand the types of calls coming in, its pretty easy and routine. Pay is relatively good, not a high stress job, but can be tiring due to repetitive nature. Kind people, Sometimes theres food, good facilities Repetitive nature of work A fun workplace because people treat me like a family and with respect Overall good fixed schedule that works for me. Benefits are overall good and teammates/coworkers are very satisfactory. Job workload is very manageable and great learning experience in manufacturing. Free lunches Less benefits Great place to work Tandem is a great place to work. Great culture, people are all very nice and helpful. I live my role and I feel everyday like I am making a huge impact on a persons life. Culture no comments Tandem is growing at a fast pace and there are a lot of opportunities but very few managers to support you. Constantly overworked due to being understaffed and high turnover. Medical facility , clean room environment Job was good, management and coworkers were okay. The pay was good too. I only worked there from an agency from May to January. They teach you a lot of things and you have to follow work instructions Overworked Tandem is growing at a fast pace and there are a lot of opportunities but very few managers to support you. Constantly overworked due to being understaffed and high turnover. work from home, gym access, good benefits high turnover No support No support from management. They just want to hit numbers but don't care about quality and people. The culture there is really bad. Temps stay temps for over a year. You have no support on the weekend shift. When something happen, they don't investigate fully and or have fairness. They'll fire you for speaking the truth and to shut you up only. Their not in compliance. Nobody follows WI. I'm glad to not be working their anymore. Poor Management The only that matters at Tandem is whether or not you meet the quiota. I've seen people get let go over the smallest of things yet others are still employed over causing big problems. The supervisors don't care about you no matter how nice they seem. A great place to work The team at Tandem was a fun group to work for. Everyone was enthusiastic and worked hard for the good of the community. Everyone is super friendly and collaborative. Free soda's, proximity to lunch dining. Difficulty to get to during the rain. Very Liberal Very sensitive and do not speak to you before hand about issues that occur. Very passive aggressive and do not go through a fair process of investigating issues when they do occur. It became apparent that if you were not on a managers good side or if they did not like you that they would rid of you. They seem to care more about getting along with everyone as opposed to doing your job correctly and showing up on time. Very Prodcutive workplace Always supportive of their employees. They value employees input. Customers are prioritized Employees are prioritized They take pride in what they do. accepting fun environment Can be boring and repetitive at times. Training is paid and thorough. A very fast paced work day but the employees are treated well and everyone is willing to help. 2 Thanks so much for taking the time to share your experience with us. A lot of focused people at work and it's a fun workplace They assemble a medical device for diabetic people. Machines make the parts and the operators assemble them. Each station has specific task for the parts to be completely ready to deliver to people 1 1 Chaos with a frat boy culture Management is so lost in their own chaos they can’t see straight. They throw money at the chaos thinking more money/employees is the solutions when management needs to MANGE the staff on hand and the poor processes they put in place. Hamster wheel is what it was like to work there. Free drinks Lack of management 2 Fair Very strict environment, clinical wise. Had to focus 100% because I was on the inspection area. Rotation was needed so other operator can take their break which gave me the opportunity to work on different machines None It was great at first year of me working there I get along with most of my co worker, leads,manager and supervisor. Fun, laugh and lots of pot lock..... None None Good place to work tandem diabetes care is a good place to work, it is growing up and there are high probabilities of growth with them, they have variety of schedules and you can apply depending on your time. Company was making cut backs. Seemed like the company had a strong start but were slowly making cut backs and you could tell going in the wrong direction. I was originally suppose to work monday - friday and got stuck working graveyard shift for months which they rotate a lot of their new hires into. Just not a healthy lifestyle for anyone who is not ready for it. A+ except pay Definitely would work here again. Great culture, good sized team, excellent management. Good product and exciting industry. Don’t have a huge amount to say but require 150 characters. Good Work Environment You trained to work a station and after a few weeks your certified in that area. You can move around to learn other stations so the job doesnt feel very repetitive. Repetitive work but fun It’s fun when working as long as you keep your hands moving and make numbers. Coworkers nice, lots of laughs. A bit loud in room and constant beeping. Nice place to work, but plan on living there more than at home. Always provided plenty of free food. Worked way too much overtime. Management was not always clear with directives. Things would just pop up all of the sudden. Stressful place to work working in tandem was okay before but getting new people and supervisor was different story, firing people with out any warnings and if the supervisor doesnt like you that means your fires automatic short breaks, firing people with no warning Innovative Product The product was life-changing for diabetics. The company followed their mission which is to lessen the burden on patients suffering from diabetes. I worked in the Philadelphia area calling on Endocrinologists, Diabetes Clinics and CDEs. Work Hard/Play Hard while wearing jeans every day Although the company was too small for my career advancement, I thoroughly enjoyed working here. Culture was beginning to lean toward long hours, but I had a great balance. Casual dress, benefits Lower than average salaries A typical day at Tandem You put on your clean suit and before you head in the clean room, you sanitize your hands with hand sanitizer. You go to your assign station and do your work according to the Work instructions and SOP's. Pure chaos High turn over rate at a very stressful work environment with almost no benefits. Very little guidance from managers, poor department planning. Does not do enough to support the Customer Technical Support team. Short Breaks, No PTO, Outdated Inefficient documentation system Work culture is fun my department (cartridge) is poor on how they manage their people When i was new I was never told to read their work instructions but work right away. Work culture Management Great compensation and benefits, but extremely long working hours The company culture, benefits and salary were great, but we worked extremely long hours. There were times when I left the office by 7 p.m. and was required to log in from home until 11 p.m. or 12 a.m. in the morning due to the lack of organization of workflow of middle management, to complete work. It got so bad to the point that the company has an action class lawsuit from previous employees regarding compensation vs. hours worked. Overall is a great company and I have heard not all departments were like mine. Great salary and benefits, awesome company culture Extremely long working hours Productive, relaxed, agile work environment Relaxed culture a lot of PTO Overall, management of R&D is not the best, but the Chief Scientist has great leadership skills. Causal dress attire Majority of the people are friendly Growing company No consideration No consideration for injured temporary employees. Hired for 2.5 months then got laid-off due to complained injury. No room for improvement and not a team-work player environment. None. politics and no consideration Great work environment I thoroughly enjoy working for Tandem Diabetes care. The management team really wants you to excel in your career and my co-workers are really great to work with. accepting fun environment Can be boring and repetitive at times. Training is paid and thorough. A very fast paced work day but the employees are treated well and everyone is willing to help. 2 Thanks so much for taking the time to share your experience with us. I had fun but wasnt happy with my wage. I liked working with people at tandem except for the manager, he always assume you are doing something bad or wont take any suggestions and feels like he is always right. Making little bit of money for so much work they want you to do. Low wage and poor management. 6 Very amazing place to work for... task is hard but the people make it worth it The daily tasks are confusing and it is a lot of work but it is a great place to work for the people are all really cool, very relaxed work environment Work culture is fun but they don’t value Long-term employees Tandem has a great product, hires great people. The culture is fun and the company is growing. Unfortunately there is little room for advancement and there is no benefit to have worked there for a long time. They need to work on valuing their current employees. I’d love to keep working for them if I could advance within the company. Thursday beer day, flexible schedules No advancement opportunities Worst place to be employed The lead is unprofessional and the supervisor is even worst. All the lead does is yell and roll her eyes at people. As for the supervisor he told me that everyone he hires is all a part of a family but he doesn't care about anyone but the lead. none everything amazing cause for device no review at this time nothing really important I have to say concerning Tandem how can you put a mininum requirement to this all should be accepted no matter what I would think all coments should up to to person writing it.Thank you fun place to work and relaxed -a team working environment -have monthly goal -management is pretty cool, but they expect too much from people. -most fun about working with them is the people I work with. -no dull moment -work shift hours is great Schedule Appraisal (to stingy) A great place to be and to build your experience Lots to do, great culture, fast paced manufacturing environment that could have you working a component issue when you arrive in the morning and on a plane to another country that afternoon. The company has grown and become a mature medical device manufacturer offering the best product in its market segment. Always keeps you busy. the long hours were fine, but the long commute impacts family life. Great benefits and work/life/balance Tandem is a great place to work for if you are looking for work/life/balance. Everyone there is extremely nice and helpful and contribution from company for benefits is very generous. Productive and fast paced I learned everything fro the ground up. The company really strives to produce the best pump in the market and are very dedicated to the customers and patients. The hardest part of the job is that more internal support is paramount to make the sales job more productive. The most enjoyable part of the job was the freedom to move the business and seeing the results of your labor o a day to day basis Tandem Cares Tandem was created because there was a need for an insulin delivery system that provided better treatment for those with diabetes. Everyone at Tandem puts patient needs first and takes pride in the work they do. Tandem is the model for how a company should be run. Great people, great management and a great product None Best job ever Can't say enough good things about Tandem. One of the friendliest manufacturing work environments I've ever worked in. Always room and opportunity for growth. Everything Sometimes the street in front of the campus floods Good Place to Start As a technical support specialist I helped customer's troubleshoot issues with their medical devices. Overall the call volume was relaxed except on the weekends, and the co-workers were nice and helpful. Great co-workers, organized troubleshooting Not many benefits, some customers were terrible, somewhat micro-managed A new company still trying to make it's way. It is a fantastic, young, company. They are a relaxed company and very accepting of diverse appearances. Tandem offers great benefits and several ""pick me ups"" throughout the year to keep your morale at it's highest! It really is a fun company to work at. The only downside to Tandem, is because they are a new pump company, they're still learning. When a new product comes out or the market shifts- Tandem always seems slightly unprepared as to how to best handle the situation. Aside from this, because Tandem is a publicly traded company, the employees aren't told crucial information until the last possible second. It tends to leave those in the ""trenches"" looking quite unprepared when customers call in to ask questions about new information that they were only told 10 minutes ago. If you can look past this, it's a company you will fall in love with. Free monthly lunches, free monthly donuts, holidays off and very casual working environment understaffed no comments the company has a very good product, the only touchscreen insulin pump in the industry. that is providing stiff competition to its competitors. the benefits are nice. Great Company Great company to work for. There full time benefits package is amazing. Overall, I would highly recommend this company. It is a great stepping stone in the biotech world. Very nice place to work Nice place to work. Nice management. Good Training. Nice environment. Very nice desk and cubicles. No micromanagement at all. Friendly people. Highly recommended. Excellent management. None. Dead-end Job I work at the Manufacturing Dept. If you have an attitude of ""Yes Sir/Yes Ma'am"" this is the place for you! You're more than welcome to voice out your opinion but they don't really care about it, the only credit you'll get from your Lead or Supervisor is a pat on a back and a ""Good Job person"" comment. However the people i work with are nice and they make work less stressful than it already is, potlucks almost every week is the best part about this job. Demanding, No chance of advancement, low compensation unless you know how to suck up. Amazing place to work with The work environment is great and the culture. It is very laid back and they really trust you to get your work done. Best company I ever worked for. The managers are really there to help you succeed and is always there to help. Getting PTO is very easy they are so flexible and really work with you and your schedule. Benefits are the best you could ask for. Benefits, Pto, Culture, Flexibility, hours, great team, Great managers No Part time options Fun workplace when it's not busy A typical day at work consists of many phone calls, on your downtime you can go to the break room to relax. Management led you on to believe you were doing well, but in reality they knit-picked every little thing you did wrong. At first, job security was great. As time went by, they had very high expectations and even expected you to come in early to work. If you came in a minute late, they could write you up. I learned to be very punctual. Truly, there was no hard part of the day; unless it meant dealing with angry customers which is given in a customer support role. The most enjoyable would be the friends you would make at work. Lots of down time. Knit-picking little things. Laid back company The hours are flexible and my manager was laid back. She was not a micro-manager. You're allowed to come in at whatever time you want and stay for 8 hrs. This means you can either start early or later if you're not a morning person. My job was not very challenging, but i enjoyed my short time there. Laid back Not challenging accepting fun environment Can be boring and repetitive at times. Training is paid and thorough. A very fast paced work day but the employees are treated well and everyone is willing to help. 2 Thanks so much for taking the time to share your experience with us. Pump instructor This is a consultant position. It is my responsibility to perform education on insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitors on a need to basis. I am contacted by someone in the organization that they need some assistance in educating a client with their insulin pump. It requires me to stay current with current technology. flexibility Requires working evenings and weekends Love what we do for our patients Working with Tandem not only help me understand more in depth about diabetes, but has also shown me what a day in the life is like with the change to trial a pump. I enjoy the culture here as well, i'm not stuck to a 9-5 job and struggling to buy clothes for business casual, it's comfortable environment and the employees are fun to work with! 1 1 Overall I enjoy and love working with them. Amazing people and place to work with, the culture here is fun, innovative and just loves their employees. They are very relaxed and the company is constantly growing. Great Culture - but with conditions Tandem was such a wonderful place to work. The culture was so strong and the teams in each department were so tight-knit. I was wondering if there could be anything wrong with the company. The longer I was there, I saw limits on the advancement of certain careers. There are expectations in place for accounting, technical support, engineering that will put caps on your advancement. The executives do a great job reaching out to the company and you will constantly see them going across the campus which is a nice feeling, knowing how big the company is. I loved working for the company but the management was at times distracted by minute details when they should have been focused on the larger issues that the company may face in the near future. Culture amongst the associates, Work/Life Balance Management's Focus Good products, aggressive goals. Company has good products and aggressive goals. Corporate culture at Tandem is very good. Very competitive business. Tandem is a few years behind on current technology, but ongoing studies to close gap. Great workplace, amazing company! My experience at Tandem Diabetes Care, Inc. has been nothing but positive. It is a warm, inviting and relaxed environment that encourages to be yourself while making a difference in the lives of individuals with diabetes. A typical day at work includes communicating with patients, doctors offices and insurance companies via phone and email. I am responsible for requesting prior authorizations for diabetic supplies, and performing insurance verification checks prior to processing orders to ensure proper reimbursement and timely shipment of orders. The hardest part about this job is learning about the struggles that people with diabetes encounter: having no diabetic pump supplies due to financial strain, running out of supplies and having to go back to daily multiple injections, diabetes-related hospitalization, etc. However, the most enjoyable part of this job is making a positive impact in people's lives. I have learned so much about diabetes and anything I can do to make their lives easier is a blessing. Casual workplace, positive environment Awesome coworkers, positive work environment. Casual, play video games on break. Hardest part of the job is the [sometimes] high stress environment; even though it's not THAT high stress. Good pay, good healthcare Short lunch Tandem Diabeties A typical day at work is meeting a quota, as simple as assembling 80 diabetes products a day split between two shifts. I worked in a small room with as little as only 4 people, we fixed returned or old pumps brought back to us from customers. The hardest part of the job is finding the mistake, some being very obvious and easy like a broken screen or something a littler harder like finding something wrong with an electrical board. Free soda, Sometimes snacks and fruits are provided for employees. Great Culture Tandem is an amazing place to work, the culture here is fun, innovative and just loves their employees. They are very relaxed and the company is constantly growing. Good company with good benefits CEO and leadership fostered an enjoyable culture that made facing daily work challenges less stressful. Culture is changing though with typical challenges of a growing company. Faces some issues overbalance of leadership versus employees. Open door policy and generally management are approachable. Good opportunities available for entry level workers. Very professional Family oriented manufacturing of pharmaceutical company. Very busy and people are friendly and helpful as well. Gained experience and skills with all the help of Supervisor of the department. Flexible hours N/a Productive Very productive medical devices company. Professionalism is within the people I worked with. Production are very helpful in every task they do. Free lunches, flexible hours Very busy. Great place to work! Very hard job and extremely competitive!!! Dog eat dog world with the competition and very large territory. The Mississippi territory is difficult because of the patient population and the cost of going on an insulin pump. Great working for a company that truly is making a difference in today's diabetes world! Great company and product! Territory extremely large! Great company and products Great company and great products. Difficult to achieve a work-life balance. Mediocre management rating is tied to shipping department. Good Life Work Balance/Poor business management Decent location in north SD, but traffic in and out is horrible. The building complex it is in has horrible traffic that you must fight to get in and get out of. good salary do not build their employees Territory Manager Working in medical sales covering New Mexico and west Texas. Currently selling insulin pumps to CDE's, endocrinologistes and internal medicine providers. Working with patients to help overcome insurance obsticals. Good culture, fun environment.

Liberty Mutual Insurance|" Great training program sets you up for success From the very beginning this company provides excellent training, great benefits and pay. The job is rewarding and they truly care about their employees. I no longer work there but would consider it again if I decided to go back down that career path. A great place for someone who wants a great entry level experience in the insurance field. Work/life balance None 80 52 Bad management, don't care about employees If you want to get a promotion you have to be in good with the management. Very cliquey! Company likes to hire new vs promoting within. Payed new hires more than tenured employees for the same positions. Easy Low Stress Career This job has been a relaxing peace in comparison to the high stress corporate sales jobs that I’m use to. Paid training, great leadership, great support, great culture, and you make your own schedule (remote/hybrid). 1 do not recommend employment here i am a former employee. the workload was never ending. was micromanaged by a team manager that did not know the job. upper management would not deal with issues raised and verbal assaults and lies of the team manager. replacement employees were not given proper training and support. result was high turnover. team members were tasked with training of the replacements w/o reduction of workload, had to work vacations and cover for team members who were out of office due to vacation. 60 + hours a week and work vacations to keep up with the workload, even when slow. i would give 0 stars if possible. would recommend not working for the company. no compassion for employees. unrealistic expectations. company car. large non-caring corporation and management The best employer I’ve ever had I’ve worked at many places, but this is the best. Everyone is helpful and no one makes you feel like a burden, even while learning. They are extremely big on work/life balance and networking as well as diversity. Although this job can be hard and even stressful if you don’t have work management, I love it. claims great work environment. the pay is competitive. promotions are good. I learned how to write claims properly and how to scope. My xactimate skills have been enhanced. The hardest part of the job was the workload. Seems like quite a bit of work for such a short amount of time. Overworked Pros: Pay was good. Benefits good. Cons: Claim volume is ridiculously high. Stretched 105% since Day 1. There was a fair amount of turnover so it was hard to stay ahead of your work. Supportive and professional environment Great place to work if you are seeking a motivated, cultured, professional, and positive environment. Front line managers are amazing, caring, supportive and driven. Not afraid to praise. Look for the good instead of focusing on the negative. If you are tired of the clinical setting, love your profession, like autonomy, tired of all the drama and unsupported management this is the place for you! I have had 6 promotions in 6 years, I referred a friend he started at 37k a year after 1.5 years he was at 52 bc of his promotions This is the best employment I have ever had, pay, PTO, benefits, 401k, HSA. Tvis is not a job you do for a little while this is a career that you retire from. There are so many different departments you can move to. If you do not like customer service you can do claims or you can get off of the phones. So far so good This company is excellent, they really care about the employees. Benefits are great and affordable. Training is excellent. Managers are accessible, great place to work and did I mention 100% remote PERMANENTLY.. Incentives None 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? Some of the coworkers What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Management is reactionary. Pressure to perform and then they move the goal posts. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? The best way to describe working here was toxic. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Email after email meeting after meeting to accomplish nothing. Good Intentions I love my company and what I do, but feel it's quantity over quality. They do encourage time off, regrouping etc. I love it, but the case load is intimidating Slammed with work and no backup The 50/50 hybrid work schedule they came up with made absolutely no sense, other than for the benefit of managers. In addition, there was so much work, it was impossible to keep up. Great place if you have a manager that supports you. Long tenure with them and enjoyed the upward mobility - work hard and get compensated well. Started as a sales agent built a solid foundation and promoted into sales coach then supervisor- great opportunities to advance. Slammed with work Never ending work, literally impossible to get it all done. Management has very unrealistic expectations of how claims will be managed. Little training support. However, very solid company to work for that values their employees 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? The end of the day What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Everything! They don’t care about employees, you are just a number and they will try and intimidate you into doing a better job. Unrealistic monthly expectations, poor pay and uninspiring leadership. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Toxic, uninspiring, intimidating What is a typical day like for you at the company? High paced, low pay, feeling like you are never good enough for management Hard work but a lot of resources and help Working in the property department can be challenging alongside not so friendly adjusters however Liberty Mutual is a great company if you want to continuously learn and broaden your career. Good benefits not enough money for the work Benefits are great. Pay could be better. As a adjuster our time is valuable, they have not found a way to streamline line the claims processed we waste so much time doing unnecessary steps on a each claim. There’s some great managers then there’s the managers who’s to busy trying to use their team to outshine the other managers. Every manager has a different claims handling process. So once you go to a new manager your starting all over. Energetic and rewarding work enviroment Great place to get your start in the insurance industry, Office culture was fun and energetic with free snacks and caffeine. You write your own business plan and work schedule. Work in the office or in the field as you please. Make your numbers and you get left alone. Fall behind and expect to get micromanaged. Overall, a thumbs up. Overworked/lack of work/life balance People are great and good company to work for, however workloads are high and expectations from customers are also high. Expected to handle everything including settlement negotiations, not allowed to let attorneys with years of experience do anything regarding the claims. Sometime difficult to answer phones, stay on top of emails as well as handle day to day task which can vary from initial contacts, compensability to reserving and settlement evaluations. Lacks common decency The place micromanages all of your calls. They will tell you if you’re helping a customer too much since the calls are timed. I was once even told that if I saw something wrong on a customers policy o was not allowed to bring it up unless it was specifically what they were calling about . Not a company I would even want insuring me !! Great training program sets you up for success From the very beginning this company provides excellent training, great benefits and pay. The job is rewarding and they truly care about their employees. I no longer work there but would consider it again if I decided to go back down that career path. A great place for someone who wants a great entry level experience in the insurance field. Work/life balance None 80 52 Tough job, but good company. Working at Liberty Mutual/Safeco is an overall good experience for the right person, a claims representative position just wasn't the right fit for me. My bosses were all extremely supportive and the compensation was more than fair for the work. There is a lot of opportunity to grow in your career here, and they support moving around in the company if a different position seems interesting after you have spent some time where you start. If you don't mind being excessively overworked, this is a great job. Loved working as a claims adjuster however, the sheer workload was impossible to maintain. The training was basic and does not fully prepare you for your role. There are a lot of outdated resources provided that do not help with the job. Once you are fully trained and receiving the 'normal' claim load, expect 60+ hour weeks to keep up with volume. Very customer centric company, however it is overkill. When you deny a claim you have to continue to reach out to the insured to provide extra support.. Which sounds great, however most claims are denied and the insured is upset. You will receive many upset customers. Non-stop emails, calls, estimating, and letters on top of receiving five new claims a day. There was literally not enough hours in the day to feel like you completed anything or made any headway. Great management, pay and benefits are great, receptive upper-management No work/life balance, stressfull, demanding, workload is excessive Great company After you pass the license test is all smooth from there. The company is amazing. They care about all employees and their growth. I look forward to staying here for a very long time. Management During my employment as a Commercial Claims Adjuster my direct Team Manager was one of the worst managers I have ever worked for. The senior leadership was always changing and provided no support to Adjusters who wanted to grow with the organization. Great place to work Liberty Mutual is a great place to work. The benefits and pay were great. I had good supervisors while I was working there, but like any other company, if you don't have good management then it's not going to be great. Great people stressful job Claims can be stressful anywhere you go, but the workload can make it unbearable. Upper management makes decisions that don’t make the most sense in an effort to make employees more productive, but all they do is burn us out more. The managers I’ve had are pretty good and my coworkers are great Micromanaging dead end job Management is terrible.... company has the highest rates on the market and longed wait in between calls. Company is losing money and looking for any reason to let go agents Fun I had a good time at liberty mutual for 5 years. It’s a great way to learn how to work with people and build your network. I would encourage anyone in sales to give it a try I'm glad I got out when I did I worked for Liberty for 8 years and am so glad I got laid off when I did. This is the kind of place where you can get sucked into and stay there forever because it's comfortable and the pay/benefits are nice. But the work environment and the management are the absolute worst. The tone at the top can not be any more true here. Management pressured and guilt tripped their employees any chance they got because it was what they were also receiving from their managers. They care more about numbers over everything. They have the do anything to get the sale mentality. No morality here. I cannot believe I spent so much time here. Benefits Bad work environment, bad management Good place to start insurance career Training was great but don’t expect a raise or to get promoted anytime soon. They overload you with work and come up with anything not to give you a raise. Large company. Product & pricing wasn't competitive The Liberty Mutual insurance products not being competitively priced in this market was the biggest issue. Had other insurance companies to sell but the commission was less and it took longer to get paid. Good manager. Not competitive on pricing. 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? Uncapped commission What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Lack of technology What is the work environment and culture like at the company? That varies by office What is a typical day like for you at the company? It should have been out in the field building relationships. My poor sales manager wanted everyone at their desk making endless cold calls. Great money, overworked Overworked and underpaid we have to do others work too when they leave the company or go on leave. There was no recognition only for the 2 people who did well and who we were being compare. To Bad work life balance A good company with potential but they work you to the bone. There is no work life balance at all. They expect u to do your work and if you are good at managing yours they force you to do other people work that can’t catch up with their own Terrible company Absolutely terrible company. Your pto you earn is reliant on someone else taking your shift and if they don’t you accrue absent points even using the pto… micro managed… terrible team leaders… if your trying to get vto u have to make sure ur looking at your emails and send it with in 3 seconds or your not getting it and they pick the same people EVERYTIME… terrible late shift you get stuck with all the calls and never any vto sent for late shift. If the company equipment breaks or you have system issues THEY DONT PAY FOR THEIR MISTAKES. Don’t get back to you when your equipment is broke or no working while not getting paid…ETC… Na Everything Good company Overall a good company to work for , excellent flexibility, does not feel like you are micromanaged, however, there are inconsistent with management reviews Young Managers If you have worked in the industry, you will likely be trained by someone who has been in for about a year. They hire fresh reps who did well in their first yr, and who know nothing of management. Amazing Love it here. Work your own desk. No micro management Benefits could be 100% better Team members normally try to help Room for advancement Benefits need to be better Advancement Benefits If you like you’re job function, Liberty is great! I held a few positions at Liberty. Two of the three, I never really liked the actual work but the opportunity to advance, make a lot of money and have great work/life balance was there. The one job function I did like in claims was just a massive amount of unnecessary stress because like other companies the staffing levels are too low for claims. But I got to travel a ton and climb all over houses and help customers and wear a tool belt. Pay, work life balance, secure, opportunity Cubicle life, weird internal politics, co-workers that make mountains out of mole hills Great place to work Good pay with great benefits. Great work life balance. Company has always had my back with anything going on outside of work and been very accommodating. Only downside is you won’t see this until after training Great training program sets you up for success From the very beginning this company provides excellent training, great benefits and pay. The job is rewarding and they truly care about their employees. I no longer work there but would consider it again if I decided to go back down that career path. A great place for someone who wants a great entry level experience in the insurance field. Work/life balance None 80 52 Pro: management con: workload Pro: Management Coworkers Con: Salary Time management Work life balance Workload People make the job and good management helps but they screw over the front line every chance they get with changes that hurt more than help Nothing to write home about Pretty decent job. No major complaints. Decent pay and benefits. Management is nice. Work is monday-friday. I was hourly not salary. Overall decdnt place to work for. 2 Quantity over Quality Liberty Mutual has been a brain wracking experience. They expect you to take a call under 5 minutes each time. If you do it, you will be penalized. They expect you to never be late more than 3 times in a 24 hour period, if so, you will get terminated. They are about empathy, which is great. But, when it comes to customers being aggressive or abusive, they will do nothing to help or support you and tell you to continue to take on calls. Liberty Mutual has been nothing to help with mental moments whenever you need one. Choose position wisely Company is great, outbound position not so much. Although it’s uncapped commission, you will be slaving like a dog to really get the check you want. You do get a base pay/salary, but it’s minimum. Hard work but worth it The job is hard but there is so much invested in helping you succeed. The hours can be long but most of the jobs are remote from home so that’s an added perk. overworked, micromanagement underpaid The workload is heavy, processes are unnecessary and stress employees further. There is a culture of micromanagement disguised as wanting to help. The pay is lower Wonderful corporate culture. Heavy workload Still have great things to say about the company as a whole even though my current position has heavy workload and high turnover. I'm all burnt out but will still be sad to leave. Nice I think it was a good place to work great people. Incentive. Decent pay. Nice hours. Friendly staff. I would recommend to someone if they were looking for a job Not a fun place to work. Liberty Mutual claims to be an Open and Honest environment. However, you are not allowed to be open and honest without retaliation. They discard long term employees. They do not value knowledge of their employees. The job change is constant and you cannot object to it. Management changes and leaves consistently. There is no clear operating model for the company to succeed. Seems to always be changing to catch up. Ok job Typical call center job, repetitive and sometimes overwhelming. High turnover, what is expected in a call center environment. Decent pay, average benefits. Not bad to work for LM Good benefits and time off, low salary Good culture and good benefits package and paid time off. Well below market salary for attorneys. No adjustments made by corporate to compensation despite rampant inflation in 2022. Like any job, get what you give I actually love working here. Sometimes work loads are high but there has been great improvement recently. This is a ""pay for performance"" company and the better your performance, the better your bonus and annual raise. I thought the training was efficient and every year they do a huge survey (monthly and quarterly too) and they ALWAYS make changes where they need to. Some managers of course are better than others but Ive been with the company for years and feel blessed to work here Great Company, Management and Culture - but the job is FLAWED Liberty Mutual is a great company to work for and you have tons of support from mentors, onboarding specialists and team members. Management was excellent as well - you are never just a number or another cog in the wheel. The problem is with how the workload is structured in this Claims Adjuster position. You are overloaded with cases from the get-go and no matter how much time you put into it or how excellent your time management skills are, you will not stay up to date. The minute you start getting a handle on the case load you have, you get another 25+ cases that have fallen through the cracks/haven't been touched in 3-6 months. So you are always behind the 8 ball because you have injured workers that are upset and in the dark about their case, needing medical care that only you can approve and they haven't been able to get because their case wasn't even looked at in months, doctors that are frustrated because their treatment requests have gone unanswered for however long (this is the tip of the iceberg)... it's all an enormous mess that is set up to ensure that the Adjuster WILL FAIL. Until the insurance industry realizes that these cases are all unique and particular in their own ways and each person/case deserves the same care and attention as the case before them, then you will always be stretched too thin and unhappy with your job performance in this job. Not to mention there's outdated case management software to contend with. All of this just ends up financially and emotionally hurting people that are already physically hurt. Pay, Management, Culture, Learning Opportunities Job Position Structure, No Overtime, No Accountability Fair workload Very easy job w/ opportunity. If you just file claims and meet your metrics you’ll be very comfortable. I suggest a later shift when you bid for a shift differential Underwriting Typical underwriting’s responsibilities and expectations. No unreasonable expectations and fair evaluation. Ultimately still working for large company with compensation limitations. Solid financially A little redundant Great benefits and support if needed, but bad if you want a stress free work environment Incredible benefits and culture for a corporation. It is a very monotonous role, but there is plenty of opportunity to make money if you can handle the stress. Burnout is very real as with any sales role and few reps remain in the role after their first couple years. There are plenty of opportunities for advancement to try other roles as well. Good company as far as insurance jobs go... Goals are realistic, you are expected to write 12 estimates a day, but their process is clunky and needs tweaking. A lot of the time the photos supplied are poor quality, and the assignments need to be routed to the correct method of inspection. They write almost all of the estimates via photo inspection. Need to send IA's and field staff on some of the claims. You are expected to write estimates upwards of $20K from photos...I think that it's unrealistic to write a quality estimate that involved from photos. Send someone out to view the vehicle. But in all it wasn't a bad company to work for. Good pay and benefits. People are nice. Stressful job overall. Comfortable place to work, but career advancement is limited if you are not in one of the development programs. The pay is great and the work is generally fairly laid back, but it is clear that if you do not enter the company either via MBA or Teach Leadership rotational programs, there is very little chance at upward mobility for you. Great place to start or finish out a career, but be weary of trying to grow there. Great Place to Start an Insurance Career Liberty is a great company to start your insurance career in. The training was exceptional and I had lots of support from local management and my immediate team. Unfortunately due to the shift to ""comparion"" and a tough insurance market the opportunity no longer suited my goals and aspirations. Your salary drops below 30k after a few months selling and if you get hit with a wave of cancellations it can be very hard to make money. There can be at times a feeling of battling against other agents within Liberty since you are going after the same sources of business. Overworked and Burned out Liberty Mutual does not care about you individually, this position will leave you will severe anxiety and stress. If you do not meet your metrics your threatened with being fired everyday Great training program sets you up for success From the very beginning this company provides excellent training, great benefits and pay. The job is rewarding and they truly care about their employees. I no longer work there but would consider it again if I decided to go back down that career path. A great place for someone who wants a great entry level experience in the insurance field. Work/life balance None 80 52 stressful to work for I learned how to fit into a work culture while working remotely as Liberty Mutual Knoxville's first fully remote COVID hire. This was the first company where I mad a significant amount of money. Great Boss Healthcare was expensive Overworked, overstressed, micromanagement Was promised so much during the interview process, but nothing was kept. It was beyond stressful, and had no support. Could not even take a bathroom break working remotely without being messaged by a manager. 6 Good Company Job is tough but support is good, benefits are good and they will invest their time and effort in you..Lots of opportunities to advance if you out in the work. Opportunity for Growth The company has a strong culture and foundation on great benefits and typically doing a solid job at rewarding hard work. Yearly bonuses and raises (as long as you’re meeting expectations) helps to keep the company competitive in pay. Work/life balance is pretty good as well. Great place to work I’ve been with liberty mutual for about a year and a half and I’ve gotten two promotions. I came in with no experience in it insurance and I was able to excel. A great company that truly cares This is the first company that I have worked for in 30+ years of my professional career that actually cares about customers and employees and not just the bottom line. LM understands the need to invest in employees growth and happiness to receive the best work from all team members. Sr leadership is interested in what we all have to say and encourages innovative ideas and agility. Proud to be an LM employee! Great company to work for. Great company to work for, decent work life family balance. Insurance seems like a boring ancient industry but I'd say it's the opposite of that. There are numerous developments that are on going creating unique challenges resulting in constant employee engagement. Opportunities to work on new projects within the insurance industry Non stop change, Went through 9 corporate reorganizations in 4 years seeing the impacts that it had internally. Workload is not manageable Workload is not manageable. Unable to provide stellar customer service due to the impossible workload. expected to work evening and weekends. Compensation is fair. Micro managed Great benefits, some of the supervisors here are great, some only micro manage to make themselves look good. They continuously add things to your job without raising pay. Great pay and benefits Be prepared to be overworked 10 to 12 hours days to stay in a decent and manageable workload. The pay, insurance and work from home are the best. But, other then that prepare to be on the phone constantly, responding to emails, voicemail and text messages non top Great benefits and supportive management Great benefits, generous pay and supportive management. You earn 12 hours of pto every month plus 4 extra personal days a year. Health insurance is affordable and most of my prescriptions are no copay. They treat their employees well. Temp to hire Very encouraging and can do attitude at first. Gives insight on work culture and incentives. Really emphasized on hard work is the only way to advance. Needs work Difficult to succeed through the micromanagement of 'supervisors'. You aren't trusted to do your job even though you're the professional. It's a very every man for themselves environment. Mediocre at best Ok place to work. Never get staffing right either over or under. Work load can be high. Times of high turnover. Rampant favoritism. Your in or you're out. Great benefits, little to no support I started as a sales associate with salary pay and was happy to learn the ins and outs of the insurance world. However, managers and senior sales reps were bragging about how much money they were making so I decided to work my way up to being a sales rep myself. The salary goes away, the support is non-existent and the stress skyrockets as you need to sell sell sell in order to make a living. The constant message from upper management was sell sell sell which encouraged certain employees to engage in poor ethical conduct. Some got caught, some didn't and those who didn't spread the secrets. Eventually the company switched to ""comparion"" and the pay structure changed, essentially screwing everybody. Overall great entry level position to learn about insurance but unless you want to work 80 hours a week, you will not make money the honest way. benefits: health insurance, vision insurance, etc. little to no mentorship/support Don’t Work Here The company has unreasonable expectations about what can be accomplished in a day. Don’t expect there to be a work-life balance. Advancement is dependent on whether or not you’re part of the woke culture. Work from home Work-Life balance, stressed out days, company sets appointments for your day Great Culture Great cure that supports growth and diversity. Moderatley competitive pay. Good place to start a career and very good at encouraging continued education Not to bad It was a good company. The pay was good and you had decent time off. You were allowed VTO which is volunteered time off, where you dont get paid, but yo can leave early calm environment fast paced Large Company, decent place to work This is a nice work environment that allowed me to hone my skills in various fields of work. I'm grateful to have been part of the Claims team and this experience has allowed me to grow as a professional. Good company culture, helpful people large company, sometimes feel like a number If you like sucking up to your manager, this is the place for you If your manager doesn’t like you, then you will fail no matter how great your numbers actually are. Your manager will give poor feedback no matter how great your numbers are. And your manager will keep you from excelling to a new position no mattered how great your numbers are Great training program sets you up for success From the very beginning this company provides excellent training, great benefits and pay. The job is rewarding and they truly care about their employees. I no longer work there but would consider it again if I decided to go back down that career path. A great place for someone who wants a great entry level experience in the insurance field. Work/life balance None 80 52 Complex Caseloads, 2 roles in one You’re expected to be a customer service agent and claims adjuster. Inherited caseload hadn’t been truly worked in nearly two years. Management knows the challenges that are present, but have little power to change anything. 4 Good Work And Life Balance Love that I work remote, maybe 7 claims a day, Metrics could be a little bit confusing but a good place to work. Easy to understand systems, They have additional mentors to help you if you need it. 2 1 Great place to work Great benefits , hourly pay is nice. Training is also great. I've been here 6 years and have enjoyed working for this company. I'm just looking for a new opportunity in a different direction Benefits Schedule A but behind the times I was surprised about the disorder and lack of a good work flow for claims through the department. We made significant changes to workflow and training while I was employed there. As far as a female positive work environment, it’s probably about par for the industry. I never focused on that. I am self confident enough not to care what they think, in general. I prefer the “let me blind you with excellence and efficiency” approach. When that is done, barriers often fall. Decent inside sales jobs Pay can be good although seems to get worse every year. Scheduling is terrible, after three years at the company and being a top earner I was still assigned Saturdays every week. Productive fun workplace You definitely want to work here the pay is amazing and the leadership is even better. I’ve been working for a about two years and loved every bit of it. Good job Nice benefits. Fast pace call center. Heavy work load for adjusters. Good time management skills required. This was overall a good company to work for. Loved it Working Liberty Mutual gives you room to grow professionally. I’ve met a lot of great people as well as had a lot of room to grow in my career. Benefits are great and start day one no complaints really love being a part of the family The company provides challenging job opportunities combined with exceptioanl work life ballance and hybrid work location options. Liberty Mutual is a well managed company from the top down. The management Team Leaders inspires their work teams to colloborate, have fun, motivate each other to achieve their work team quarterly goals and work toward continuous process improvement. Liberty Mutual can be a fun place to work with lot's of team support and interaction. They are also supportive of your personal time off and depnending upon your role supportive of a hybrid work concept Overall Great Company - Role is Stressful Liberty is an amazing company with great benefits. That said, this role in particular is extremely mentally taxing. 200 claim benchmark with new incoming daily, and they ramp you up fast. Dealing with multiple states that all have unique laws that dictate how your legally required to handle/respond. Once you start litigated claims you will be required to travel for mediations sometimes. Accidental mishandling can land you personally in hot water in some states. You have a set “schedule” but if your claim load is high and your running against deadlines - rest assured you will be working long hours. I love the company but this particular line of business is really difficult. Would like to stick around with liberty as the company itself is fantastic but will likely be investigating a new line of business It was ok Decent pay, great people but the job itself is repetitive. The benefits were really good including a decent amount of PTO and above average health insurance coverage Excellent place of work! I’ve worked both in house counsel and as an insurance agent.! There was a job security during the pandemic and as coming to terms with permanently being virtual. There was a lot of support with the transition! Liberty mutual truly cares about their employees! They continually make you feel inclusive though we are virtually! Lgbt, different cultures, and women in leadership. It’s a safe work environment with tons of opportunities to grow! Stable but boring So many things about liberty are great, there is a reason why retention is so good. Work life balance is amazing most of the time (team dependent), compensation and bonuses are usually on the higher end of the market especially for the reasonable number of hours worked. Everyone who works in corporate is very smart and very professional which eliminates so many headaches. The work in most cases is boring and in some respects so are the people. Especially post-Covid, people do there 8 hours and then move on. There is very little team bonding, very little outside of work activities, and almost no one goes into the office any more. Career development is better than most companies with clear directives and frequent feedback, but promotions have slowed in the past few years which caused some frustration. Overall, you can make a little more money or have a more exciting job elsewhere, but the stability and corporate professionalism is certainly very nice. More work than is possible daily. Under staffed At Liberty Mutual, the same type of people navigate to management all over the company. Most will micro manage you to death while providing little to no support unless you are on their list of favorites. Meanwhile all your colleagues quit and do not get replaced. Competitive wage. Fair amount of FTO More work than is possible per day, understaffed. Constantly taking on more and more responsibility for no additional compensation Above average Pretty alright company to work for. Paid above market-rate for above market workload. Time off is extremely limited and earned on a rolling basis as opposed to entirely upfront which made vacation planning miserable. Trrrible management in Sub Departments There are departments built off of the initial inbound team that have been run by incompetent individuals. The choice/broker department specifically. Extremely flexible, growth slow The company works with you to ensure work life balance - no questions asked. Very helpful there. It feels like no one is ever going back to office and feel career growth can stagnate because of that. Your role/responsibilities can quickly outpace your pay. The people in my office (before COVID) are all committed, capable, and great to be around! Workload can feel overwhelming as you are constantly treading water - but that is the role. Good entry-level job It's a good place to start a career and stay for a 1 or 2 but not stay longer. The pay is low and benefits are standard. They do have a hybrid work model. There is no upper mobility unless you are in their Boston hq office. Hybrid work Pay is low and no advancement High investment in IT employee satisfaction in recent years Liberty has made a significant improvement in IT employment satisfaction in the last 8 years, by investing in management and individual training, stack modernization and job flexibility. Work Overall it's great. I can't complain as far as the job goes. However at one point we were going through people left and right. It's slowed down but security is always like that."

FanDuel|" Great Company, awful schedule Honestly, in regard to working in a Customer Service Role, it is tough to receive a raise, and even tougher to be promoted. If you are in the Daily Fantasy Sports Customer Ops department, you will not have a set schedule and often will not know when you are working for the upcoming week which makes it tough to have a life outside of work. During NFL season you will work Thursday through Monday, Saturday & Sunday are 100% mandatory. Positives: Great co-workers/Supervisors Flexible (unlimited) Paid Time Off Paternity Leave 401k and health benefits are excellent Not having a set schedule and no standard pay raise in over a year of employment does not work for me personally. However, if you love fantasy sports and sports betting, this may be a great job for you. Great co-workers/Supervisors, Flexible (unlimited) Paid Time Off, Paternity Leave, 401k and health benefits are excellent No set schedule, mandatory work days 2 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Good work hours. Company seems to be lacking a true vision for its direction. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Very little performance feedback. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? They haven't figured that out. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Roller coaster ride. 1 Best Best company to work for. Amazing benefits, hours, overtime, and atmosphere! Training is fantastic supes are very helpful. There’s overnight shift as well. Good Company, Bad Management Toxic. Promotions are not based on merit or qualifications, simply who is more well like on a personal level by management. SportsBook in a prime location, but poorly run. Long hours, never off weekends. Rules only apply to certain individuals. Weak leadership and waste of time Management is constantly hiring people who are not reliable but expect you to be, repeat the same rules to you everyday as if you were just hired, lie to you and don't address it when they're caught, preach team yet hold nobody accountable, and create a hostile with environment. The pay is decent for doing very little but don't let that suck you in. Take bets on credit. You'll become a pessimist quickly. Horrible Have maybe 2/3 people working there that understand sport gambling. VIP Customers are baited with smoke and mirror tactics to lure them into a wager then changing number at window. Management clueless. Take wagers on credit Fun and Exciting Product Fanduel is probably the only job I've had where I can say I care about the actual product. There are tons of opportunities to learn something new and there is flexibility to work on things that matter to you. Your opinion matters! The hardest part of the job is the learning curve and learning the product because it is very niched and can be difficult at first to learn the terminology and overall structure. Beautiful office, great happy hours, nice accommodations when traveling, great benefits, fun environment, support from management none that I can think of Live is terrible Fan duel is a great company, however Live! Is not a company you want to work for. They care more about having you do other departments jobs bc they’re too lazy to staff said departments. Over worked, paid less then the other 2 casinos, who do much less business. And zero flexibility with scheduling Ok. Most mangers are good. I feel like you can't make any mistakes without getting your score going down. The other good things is holiday pay. It's work from home. Great company to work for If working in customer service, you would spend your day answering emails and chats from customers. The company is a great company to work for. I enjoy this job a lot. I highly recommend. Productive a fun work place. Fanduel is a fun place to work. The people are nice and it is a great company. Unfortunately the salaries are generally low paying and there was little room for growth. Remote Little pay, work nights and weekends. Good place to work over all. Need to stop losing talent, leadership say they see the burn out but do nothing about it. Stop bragging about revenue and hire more people where needed. Great benefits, structure for bonus and promotion, learn a lot and gain experience. Over worked and understaffed There is no culture Overall, good job. WFM, decent pay and good benefits including unlimited PTO. 3 Stars because management loves to micromanage ever since Salesforce was introduced. Promotion opportunities are there but having one bad week will be held against you. They will hire their favorites, not the best performing. PTO and benefits, decent pay. Free lunch/dinner and gifts every once in a while Promotion opportunities, micromanagement makes you feel like a robot Mediocre comp but good WLB Strong growth prospects for the company and industry as a whole. As a result of this fast growth though, lacks a lot of clear processes. You're given a good deal of autonomy and ownership even early on, but also not given a whole lot of support and guidance for growth. All things taken into consideration, it's a decent place to start. Strong worklife balance, fair deal of autonomy Below market comp, unclear paths torwards advancement Great place to work Great company! Health benefits are pretty good. The free options aren’t great coverage but they have good plans that are paid. The long term incentive program has taken a bit to get details on. I’ve heard that they’re re-doing health plans to give more customized ones and hopefully the long term incentive program is good. Everyone is very nice and wants to do a good job. There’s a lack of structure in some areas so that may bother some folks. I like the autonomy that provides. Unlimited PTO Amazing culture - room to grow Have been fulfilled through my time with FanDuel. Plenty of opportunity to succeed. Effort is recognized! Culture permeates throughout the business. New offices and positions opening regularly. Pay/benefit package, culture Dynamic Company in a Booming Industry I've been with FD for six years now, and seen the company in a lot of stages. With online sports betting being legalized state-by-state in America, everything is looking up for the company - revenue pouring in, not even close to hitting a ceiling. The focus has been scaling up to match the massive demand. It's a fun place to work - sports oriented, extremely young, lot of changes to keep things fresh. I have good work/life balance and excellent experiences with management. My salary is fair (not great) but the benefits are excellent and I've had no trouble taking time off of work. I think experiences are going to vary based on the company size - it's growing massively, all over the US, and different locations and departments will have different experiences, but morale within the company is high, and it definitely has a Winning Team vibe. It's baffling that such a progressive young company has such a commitment to mandatory office presence, even after a year+ of massive success remote. The office itself is fine - standard ping pong table and beer fridge, open office floorplan, etc. Most of the 'fun' commodities go unused. Overall, the benefits, culture, and company context are nearly unbeatable, and I could see myself spending the next 20 years here. Solid management, good benefits, sports culture Tethered to inconvenient office locations, modest crunch at times Weak pay, disorganized company, no room for growth They will market from day one how much room for growth there is from CS to other departments, or even within CS. Everyone wants to get out of CS because it's a terrible experience. Terrible pay, constant fires you have to put out every day with awful customers because the product is bad, and management constantly makes awful changes and doesn't seem to have a clue what CS even does for the company. Aforementioned promotions are done based on politics/other reasons and not merit. The process is awful; they will completely ignore your contributions during your employment, your resume, whatever you have to offer and solely focus on irrelevant topics as a reason for not being even considered for promotion. It's very clear this company treats CS as beneath everyone else, which is the opposite of the ""get your foot in the door here at FanDuel and your possibilities are endless no matter where you start! Even in CS"" narrative that that's constantly spewed. culture is decent pay, advancement, stress, disorganization Horrible management Management does not care about their employees. They just want the work done with no real training. They are lazy and no help. There is not enough employees for the amount of work. Also if your not related to someone you will get nowhere. Manangement does not care Management does not care they only want the job done, even with no training. There is too many family members and friends hired and they get better treatment The sky's the limit This company has given me all the tools I need to succeed. The over/under on how long I will be with the company is set at 30 years. Id take the over. Unlimited knowledge available to me around the clock. None Great Company, awful schedule Honestly, in regard to working in a Customer Service Role, it is tough to receive a raise, and even tougher to be promoted.

Great co-workers/Supervisors, Flexible (unlimited) Paid Time Off, Paternity Leave, 401k and health benefits are excellent No set schedule, mandatory work days Amazing Company By far, one of the best companies I have ever worked for. Not only are co-workers amazing, every person, on every level, acknowledges you and treats you like an actual human being. They provide healthy snacks and coffee, fresh fruit, etc daily. They have fun company sponsored events often that really boosts employee morale. The atmosphere is fun and exciting, and upper management was willing and offered mentorship to help me grow. They trust their employees and treat them well. They also pay VERY well, above what most employers pay for this position. I had to leave the company because my family relocated out of state, but I was truly, VERY sad to leave. 5 Busy and Fun work. Great company, room for growth, fun atmosphere. A lot of people come in and out daily. Management is always there and hears what you have to say. Recommend people to work at fanduel. 1 1 Many interactions with management and clients constant interaction with clients betting on events from every sport. Tips are good on certain sports and events. Union based. Large sums of money is handled. productive work place Very productive work place with a welcoming team from the employees to the supervisors. Learned a lot of sporting information that i never knew about and even brushed up on some technology skills . Glad to say that i walked away from this company with an amazing learning experience as well as some new skills not just in customer service to add to my resume. free lunches and events held by the company Weekly column online injury consultant I had the opportunity to write a weekly column for this online sports entity in which I reviewed a discussed injuries to college football players in terms of diagnosis, prognosis and impact on both the player and the team. I worked with coaches and athletic trainers around the USA gathering information and including it in my weekly columns. Worked from home, enjoyable work I only worked during the college football season Hires Beware I anticipate a lot has changed since my short tenure, but during my time, FanDuel was an organizational mess from top to bottom. I was only with the company for less than a year prior to being laid off with roughly 20% of the rest of the company, which apparently isn't too uncommon ground there. Very volatile business, not a place worth going to unless you're willing to take a risk. Most of the people happen to be nice and fun to work with Little to no job security, used to be a very unpredictable future given legal issues (but perhaps that is changing), poor management that doesn't care to make any effort of transparency Great work environment. Very Young Very relaxed work environment. Theres plenty of snacks and beer in the the kitchen which is a plus and the workers are all young and have drive. Definitely recommend as a first or second career job. Productive and fast paced. Great culture with hard-working employees. Positions may be volatile due to the nature of the industry. Supervisors and managers tend to provide very thorough advice and feedback on how best to improve. FanDuel is a great place to work but isn't without flaws The culture at FanDuel is great and I loved working there. However, low pay and a history of layoffs takes away from making this an excellent place to work. full time entry level Good first job-- great benefits, decent pay, great hours, great team, cool office and culture. Loved the people I worked with and the work we were doing but was at the company at a very choppy time terrible upper management and chaotic no true direction Awesome Job Typical day you would come in to work look at your open tickets, finish all of your open tickets, go to the que get assigned a category and work on that for the remainder of your shift. lots of perks including free lunches, work from home option etc N/a Fun workplace Work/Life balance is great and culture is very easy-going. Management makes all of the decisions and there isn't a lot of transparency though. Overall great people but since it's such a new company the organizational structure causes a lot of bottlenecks. Great Culture, Unstable job fun to work for, however a volatile industry where job is not guaranteed. Lots of contract work available during football season, prone to layoffs. Gambling industry. free lunches, fun sports atmosphere no benefits, contract work, prone to layoffs FanDuel CS Great environment for anyone into sports. Management is great and expects you to push for your own opportunities/additional tasks. You are trained prior to being thrown into the fire. Good benefits. Full time CS agent makes 40K with benefits. Opportunity to move up is minimal. Most of the job can be done from home. Great Company, awful schedule Honestly, in regard to working in a Customer Service Role, it is tough to receive a raise, and even tougher to be promoted.

None Great Company, awful schedule Honestly, in regard to working in a Customer Service Role, it is tough to receive a raise, and even tougher to be promoted. If you are in the Daily Fantasy Sports Customer Ops department, you will not have a set schedule and often will not know when you are working for the upcoming week which makes it tough to have a life outside of work. During NFL season you will work Thursday through Monday, Saturday & Sunday are 100% mandatory. Positives: Great co-workers/Supervisors Flexible (unlimited) Paid Time Off Paternity Leave 401k and health benefits are excellent Not having a set schedule and no standard pay raise in over a year of employment does not work for me personally. However, if you love fantasy sports and sports betting, this may be a great job for you. Great co-workers/Supervisors, Flexible (unlimited) Paid Time Off, Paternity Leave, 401k and health benefits are excellent No set schedule, mandatory work days 2 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Good work hours. Company seems to be lacking a true vision for its direction. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Very little performance feedback. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? They haven't figured that out. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Roller coaster ride. 1 Best Best company to work for.

Delta|" Good job. Money was good This was a good job at the time. Money was good and my co-workers were supportive and just flat out great people. Full time 9-5 job. Long lunch break and was able to even workout in their gym after work. great people, great lunch i was hired as a temp 11 Great culture Delta has really rose to the occasion on diversity, mental health, benefits and all aspects that are desired in the current climate of America. They support their employees in times when passengers can make it hard to do so. The pay sometimes doesn’t seem enough for the workload especially when flight attendants have received many perks and additions in recent year. There is plenty of room for growth however and that is promoted. What you make it I was a flight attendant with Delta from May of 22' to SEPT 22' and was based in MSP. A typical day could vary depending on who you were assigned trips with. The fellow attendants could be very stand offish to the new hires and management was no help in fixing the matter just apologized over and over. They all are new to the position and offer no help or solutions to any of the problems most of what you learn is by trial and error or by the very few senior flight attendants that offered advice. This was the most enjoyable part the lovely people that you do sometimes get assigned trips with. My advice for anyone assigned here. Keep your head down, be mindful of making ""friends"" don't trust the management and transfer as soon as possible. Meeting other new hires, Some trips Management knows nothing, no support The company has merits but needs stronger management and better pay This would be a great entry level job for a young person. Low entry pay for work expected (depending on department you end up in) but if you can make it past the first few years, it’s worth it. There’s a lot of room for growth within the company. The overall culture is changing with many new hires. However, the veteran employees tend to have very poor attitudes and are not very welcoming to new hires. You will meet some interesting and good people, though. Once you are proven to be a good worker, fellow employees will be more open to working with you. It’s a place where you can meet new friends. If you end up on the ramp, be prepared to work HARD. Working outside can be very unforgiving, at times. The luggage bins of the aircraft are small so being tall or large will work against you. You will be sore and hurting for a while until your body can adjust to the amount of physical labor you will be doing. Being physically fit will in advance will help. Management ranges from wonderful to poor. Some of the managers are a pleasure and will help with anything needed, others will avoid you and some will speak down to you no matter the issue. There is a serious lack of communication. Most advisements are sent through email unless you do something wrong, then they want to speak with you directly. There is very little praise so if you are the type of person who needs to be assured they are doing a good job, you will not find that here. Working outside gives you a sense of freedom. Overall, I would recommend working for Delta. The flight benefits are a huge perk. The insurance 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Everything! The company is growing and treat their employees very well. The Airline is up and coming in 's style. They handle problems with complete knowledge and insure the guest is as happy as they can make them. Delta offers support in so many ways.

At some point Delta Airlines will be the number one airlines to fly with and to work for. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? The only stressful part is when you actually can not find the flights your guests need even using sister airlines. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?

Travel perk What is the most stressful part about working at the company? I would have to arrive to work one to two hours early to find a park and take a shuttle bus to work.

Productive and Fun place Two weeks training 10-7, bid for schedule/seniority, free flying benefits under standby, international flights you play taxes, health insurance and schedules changes every three months. 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Just a great company who cares about its employees and gives their employees a voice. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? NA none of it is stressful for me What is the work environment and culture like at the company? I love the work environment. It is totally different from what I’ve done before. It’s new and fresh. What is a typical day like for you at the company? I’ll come in find out what my goal is for the day I meet with my team we share ideas on how to get meet our goal and we get the job done. Amazing benefits I love working for delta! They take care of their employees. They are constantly striving to be the best airline employer and improve every aspect of work. It's okay will meet a lot of good people as coworkers and get to travel Has a decent work life balance. will meet a lot of good people from all walks of life as coworkers. Can't really say the benefits are outstanding but it is The best airline to work for in the U.S Even though it pains me that i can't go back. I LOVED my time at Delta. They know how to take care of thier employes. Truly they hire the best and it shows 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? Avoiding management What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Horrible Management in Atlanta What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Culture is COMPLETELY TOXIC What is a typical day like for you at the company? Avoiding my supervisor in atlanta 1 star What is the best part of working at the company?

What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Understaffing What is the work environment and culture like at the company? They were northwest airlines and had a pension but they voted to merge by voting union and pension out. I missed pension minimum by one month which was 5 years and then I quit. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Nonstop work but exhausting when understaffed. Workplace The crew that I worked with was awesome we really worked like a team. For once I felt like a team working for this company. The management was young but dependable and always acted upon in the most trusting way. Short Breaks throughout the night No Parking Spots 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Schedule flexibility, vacation days, health insurance, 401K match. Career advancement opportunities. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Irregular operations, long days (12-19 hrs) pay needs to be matched for increasing job responsibilities. Manager to flight attendant ratio is 1/200. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? That depends on senior management. They can make or break morale by their management choices. As of today, we are highly diverse, and equitable. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Fast paced, long hours. Hurry up and wait. Productive and exciting work environment Considering the amount of people employed by Delta airlines there was always someone to help you along the way. Room for growth in the company continuously. If you love to help people this job certainly fulfilled that necessity. Good job. Money was good This was a good job at the time. Money was good and my co-workers were supportive and just flat out great people. Full time 9-5 job. Long lunch break and was able to even workout in their gym after work. great people, great lunch i was hired as a temp 11 Fun place to work. The travel benefits is unmatched! I value my freedom of movement. Being able to book a flight anywhere in the world at a moments notice is amazing! Delta rocks. Everyday is a new day, and everyday is an adventure. travel benefits 1 Good and Friendly work environment Love my job, everybody is cool. We all work as a team to ensure flights depart on time. It's very easy to do and the flexibility as far as scheduling is top tier. I would recommend this to anyone. Your average customer service job Decent job coming out of college ,good leadership , good benefits, you will be on the phone all day, fun culture, low pay until you move up in company which can take years. Favorite company/job This was by far my favorite job. They value their employees. Loved what I did! Had a great team and great experience. Great shift options. Great pay! Great for networking I started as a ticket/gate agent then transferred to the Reservations department for full-time. It was a good experience working at the physical airport. Training was not so good, they only had one trainer and they worked at night & I was on the day shift. So I was thrown in but my coworkers were helpful! Training was much better & thorough in Reservations! Management at the airport wasn’t very supportive. No chance to grow or move up to a higher position unless you leave the station, not an ideal situation for people with families. The only way to get full time to stay in your city is by going to reservations. Reservations management was more supportive! You do meet a lot of people at the airport and within the company in general! Very good for networking! The employees stick together you can count on them for anything! 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? They treat all employees like family What is the most stressful part about working at the company? No stress…everyone is treated like family What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Very inclusive…everyone is treated the same What is a typical day like for you at the company? As an IT professional, a typical day included preventative maintenance, repairs and documentation Great Benefits. The Culture has changed Great company to develop and learn. Delta offers great benefits including discounts to other companies and Ofcourse the travel which is standby travel. The company has changed with many managers who should be out are still there and the good ones resign or get walked out. Favoritism is big at this company. You can get held back from transferring from one city to the other if a Politician (leader) doesn’t like you. Travel, overtime, team work Managers, Culture changed Culture isn't what it used to be. Has become very PC Used to be a great company to work for. My particular area doesn't pay well. It certainly isn't what you know but how well you are liked when it comes to pay raises and advancement. Bad after pandemic Good place to work. Every day was the same. Exciting customers. Good benefits. Pay isn’t that good especially in the city we’re costs are higher. Fast paced Delta’s flights benefits would be wonderful if you ever have the time off to enjoy it. Schedule bids are horrible if you’re new you never get the schedule you want. Managers were nice and understanding Yes I work for Delta for 36 years great place and work help raise family never missed a pay check. Great benefit just little disappointed with my retirement package but other than that great company. 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? Be careful working for delta they try to scam you into working for pennies because you can fly anywhere delta goes.... lol nope what they dont tell you is there is a 3 teer system and when you are just an hourly employee your stand by tickets are teer level 1 so that means you will be bumped off any flight for just about anything. Management wich I was get teer 3 wich is the same as pilots and crew so you cant be bumped off. Its all a scam they pay nothing keep the money at the top and forget that without all the hard work of ramp and ticket personnel there company wouldn't run. I would suggest working elsewhere also even as management you are expected to be on call and you schedule is always different that way they can make sure you dont get to use those stand bye tickets. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Dealing with upper management What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Bad management is treated bad by corporate and well has the saying goes it runs down hill What is a typical day like for you at the company? Go go go fater faster faster we dont care. As corporate says Excellent Treatment of employees Employees are treated like family..I served 2 years as union shop steward representing my fellow workers with management to improve work conditions, if needed..Always had a smile on my face & was a great listener.My job performance was above average & won several sales awards. Outstanding supervisors & management Poor weather conditions, flight cancellations love delta Delta is great, delta provides the delta difference, flight benefits are amazing, and staff/,managers are always lovable and easy to get along with... Benefits are the best! Great place to work especially if you love to travel with your family. Customers can be tough to handle sometimes but worth the hassle. I highly recommend Nice perks, but no work/life balance Okay pay, good benefits, great travel. If it’s your dream job and you want the lifestyle, there’s nothing else like it. But it comes at a heavy cost. Expect to work every weekend and every holiday for the rest of your career. You won’t get much sleep and you’ll have to choose between having money or having time at home. I enjoyed it a lot when I was young but now with a family I’m not so sure. To each their own. Busy days Clock in, check your flight, working with different people everyday you get to see the different work ethics but most times it’s a hassle and favoritism is everywhere. Amazing place to work! I enjoyed every minute of my 42 years with Delta Airline’s. I traveled the world, had amazing group meetings in many places, won many awards and brought a brand new airplane back from Toulouse France. I have no regrets. Great benefits, medical dental, 401k, flying and an incredible retirement package. Security issues at work after 9/11 Great flying benefits! Great company to work but some lower level management make it hard for people to prosper. At some stations management gives a lot of credence to gossips and divulges employees confidential information. If you try to take it to HQ meaning Atlanta they perpetuate the idea that you are a bad worker and retaliate against you. The best flight benefits in the airline industry Retaliation and racism Productive and diverse workplace Great place to work that gives you an opportunity to work with a very diverse population. Busy most days, but plenty of ways to move up in the company to create change. Good job. Money was good This was a good job at the time. Money was good and my co-workers were supportive and just flat out great people. Full time 9-5 job. Long lunch break and was able to even workout in their gym after work. great people, great lunch i was hired as a temp 11 No day is ever the same One of the best companies that you could hope to work for; however, there is still alot of room for improvement and growth. Larger strides and initiatives for true diversity are still lacking. The culture is ALL about SENIORITY and can be very inclusive at times, but also mocks diversity when you only see a selected few being chosen for merit positions in areas of advancement. There is also a sense of support perpetuated within the culture until it's really needed ; then management falls short every time and it becomes every man for themselves. Therefore, documentation is key to maintaining your integrity. HR is also a joke, which is very disappointing because it's an internationally global company, but there is never a clear direction of who your contact will be. The benefits are the best part, but can be very limited on the travel side until you gain seniority. Profit sharing is the best time of the year! It makes getting through the worst days completely worth it. 1 Very flexible schedules You can pick up and drop trips. There is a lot of flexibility in your schedule. You can fly as much or as little as you want. It is a fun place to work and you become very close with fellow flight attendants. Some days can be very long and you have to be flexible with delays and mechanicals, etc... 1 The good is pay and the bad having to work flights by yourself A typical day at Delta is interacting with customers can be very hectic and chaotic with Delta being short handed sometimes you’re required to work flights by yourself We do it for the bennies Obviously the flight benefits are the best thing. However, Delta is a great company to be a part of. As a check in agent, it’s high stress and you bid for your schedules by seniority. They provide profit sharing to their employees and now benefits for all employees. Depending on what station you’re in, it may be hard to advance because nobody ever leaves! If you ever have the opportunity to work here, do it. Very Fun place to work. The staff is great. The center is very diverse. I love coming to work and learning new things . If you want to move up and grow with a company Delta is the place. The Delta Difference Delta Air Lines is the BEST #1 airlines in the US! I really enjoyed my job! Covid -19 happened and I took the package! Delta is by far the BEST employer I’ve had with corporate America!!! Amazing Opportunity A wonderful company with excellent oportunities for advancement. The benefits are outstanding and there is so much to learn about the industry. Great way to see the world great Benefits and great time off the work environment is very inviting. there is plenty off opportunity to grow within the company. they offer profit sharing that a great bonus every year. Great Advancement Opportunities Management will help you advance within the career you're in now or in another division at Delta. There's a lot you can do no matter what level you start out in. I'm excited for my career to progress at this company! Not what I expected Company expects you to have flexibility for them but not willing to be flexible with their workers. It’s most seniority based so you’ll barely use your holidays and the only way to get the days off is mostly swapping with colleagues. And plenty of favoritism when it comes to those who are higher up. Yes, the travel benefits are good but with those factors mentioned you hardly can’t use them. The most amazing company I’ve ever worked for Overall the compensation is extremely fair. The flight benefits are an awesome perk. The management is great, specially since you have more than one person to go to. HR is on top of everything and offer a lot of support and assistance. I have not one bad thing to say about this amazing company. Really not all that Not a very transparent company. Managers on the operation side are not professional and tend to not be truthful. The jobs on the operation side are very disruptive Travel the world Nice travel benefits, however thats does not over rule dealing with the constantly rude, greedy, and needy public. Management has some peoples back and not others, it depends on if you are with the in crowd or not. Can be stressful but also it is up to you to make that change! Worked and loved the people upper management is the same at most places just trying to fly under the radar! I was out in the open and not afraid to speak my mind. Good people, understanding life No reasons behind some decisions! Wonderful company to work for. Compensation and benefits are outstanding once you reach the pay ceiling. This company cares for their employees and treats us like family. Growth potential is high. Hardest part of the job is that it is seniority based and one must bid for their work schedule. Can't always get what you want until you have some time with the company. Your ability to swap days and schedules is encouraged. Excellent company and Culture Great place to work! Awesome people that will get the job done. Excellent career. They will always strive to take care of their employees. In the rare case a layoff is required they will bring everyone back when possible. Great pay, benefits, and advancement opportunities IT support or lack there of. Job No look else where they promote who they want no regards to experience,it’s who you know and how long you know themRun run run delta is the what everyone thinks it is fun and encouraging workplace New employee but so far so good. Encouraging staff and nice employees. alot of training and benefits. lots of room for promotion and very caring company toward employees. Exhausted and overworked Being a flight attendant for Delta isn’t what it used to be. We are overworked, underpaid and under appreciated. The company doesn’t care about us and it’s obvious. They work us into off days often (no matter the seniority), lowered our trip credit times so they’re able to pack our schedules and work us more and only offer 4 sick call outs a year. So many flight attendants are suffering from mental health issues due to working for a company who quite frankly doesn’t care about the health of its workers. I wouldn’t recommend this job to my worse enemy, to be honest. Love Delta Delta is great company, sometime problem is old school local management who stock in their roll for 50 years and don't want to retire. Most advantage is options to work at home for res. Benefits Salary Good job. Money was good This was a good job at the time. Money was good and my co-workers were supportive and just flat out great people. Full time 9-5 job. Long lunch break and was able to even workout in their gym after work. great people, great lunch i was hired as a temp 11 Inclusive, productive work environment Delta Air Lines, Inc has a lot to offer. The company is completely inclusive, supporting and embracing individuals from all walks of life. The perks that come with a Delta career are amazing ad the gratification of working in the airline industry is the best. As far as lateral movement, well, its all about who you know and not necessarily because you are the best candidate. Enjoyable Work Environment I loved every minute of my job as a flight attendant. I enjoy problem solving, helping others, and making an experience for others. You rarely worked twice with co-workers. This makes the work environment different and new every time. Visiting cities and countries is also a nice benefit. 1 Great Job Great Job, you are pretty much your own boss. There is a lot of down time between flights and the pay is reasonable. Also the travel benefits are amazing! Run End of the day you are just a numbers. This company has changed for the worst over the last few years. Company culture, family atmosphere ALL GONE! Management has lost all focus of stratification thinks and is only focused on putting out the fires. Very good, Teamwork, amazing management they will always be there for you making sure you are succeeding all your goals. I am very lucky that I was part of the Delta's Family. they will teach you, and if you have any doubts or concerns they are there to help you out. if you join the Delta Family you will not regret it. I have always love my job and In bad weather delays are the worse but with a smile and respect. Working in the airline industry is a very challenging job. A lot of responsibility and safety procedures and profesional and respect. And flexibility is a must. Good place to work at while in college Learned how to do analytics projects and provide insights from plenty big datasets. Perks are great, and a great group of people. Manager was a bit of a micromanager and not very flexible, but overall a great time. Flight benefits, high expectations for projects Not the highest pay, micromanaging fun workplace training was great, the hours can be crazy only because there are only 3 shift, and Atlanta traffic an be chaotic. if you live nearby then you should be fine. there are very strict about reliability, you will be fired if you are no show within the first 90 days. So you have to be completely available and stick to your schedule no excuses at all. Best place I ever worked at Loved working for Delta!! Got to travel with my family to a lot of different places. There was flexibility and my managers were the best. I found my best friend while working for Delta A good company overall I like working for Delta. It definitely has its bad days like any job. Especially working as a gate/ticket agent. Passengers can definitely be stressful and demanding. But other days it's not bad. They definitely allow you to move around the company which is nice but there is a bit of nepotism or bias when it comes to getting certain positions. Often they already know who they want to hire before they even post the job opening. But other than that, the pay is decent, the benefits are great, and you definitely bond with your coworkers. Not all of them lbs, but a few. I would absolutely recommend Delta Airlines. Long hours You have to work pretty hard when someone doesn’t show up to work and sometimes you may have to work overtime. Overall the benefits are good and you can fly free. Productive and fun Loved my job, the only done fall was working outside in the winter. It had some flight benefits which was a plus. The pay is better if you work in a big city. Interesting and exciting. Never the same two days in a row! Simply put, Delta is the best and Delta cares. These issues are truly necessary for a rewarding career. I never regretted my many rewarding years at Delta. I would do it all over again. obvious, travel benefits maybe a little too structured work environment Perfect for entry-level leaders I've learned that I have patience. Being able to complete multiple tasks throughout a work week is mind blowing. My job is to analyze, identify the problem, plan, and execute. Great Delta is a fun and inclusive place to work. Schedules can be a but difficult but the company does it’s best to meet all accommodations. The benefits are beyond any other company. Great job and benefits I enjoyed working at Delta but had to resign due to health issues. It was extremely hard to get a day off because you had to find someone to trade with Not what it used to be. Delta is not what it used to be. More so, the pandemic ruined our morale. We are overworked as flight attendants and not cared about. We face excuse after excuse. Weak leadership and untrained supervisors I have always thought of Delta one of the top airlines and I thought it would be a great company to work for and the flight benefits would be a huge perk. I was wrong on both counts. It is a petty work environment where meeting goals trumps doing the right thing and the flight benefits are useless, most flight are full or near so. Not what I thought I was so excited about working for Delta but this company well at least the center I work at is horrible. Good ole’ boy philosophy and they truly do not care about employees. Good place to work It's fun with people who work, and the environment is good. I can gain a lot of experience and knowledge, and I am also satisfied with Pay. Various aircraft type, good chance to learn Good job. Money was good This was a good job at the time. Money was good and my co-workers were supportive and just flat out great people. Full time 9-5 job. Long lunch break and was able to even workout in their gym after work. great people, great lunch i was hired as a temp 11 My job is very flexible, can plan for days off by swapping with co workers Some days are harder than others. Sometimes the people you work with are great and some are not. But, overall a great place to work! The pay is good and the flexibility is incredible. Being able to fly anywhere on benefits has gotten harder over the years but still an incredible benefit. The hardest part of the job is how quickly it changes, nothing is consistent. You must be able to quickly problem solve. free travel on standby working long days that you didn't plan for 1 Generally a great place to work. Although a great place to work the last year has not been the best for employees. More improvements are needed. Non-pilot employees need more of the pie. You can't live with just this one income alone You will definitely need a spouse' or partner's additional income because you will NOT be able to pay rent or mortgage alone with Customer Service wages, specially because the cost of living did go up in Texas. Expect to work weekends, always. You will get your weekends back when you get older like in your 60s or 70s. You have to be there long enough to get weekends off, and those who does are in that age group. The management doesn't give the Frontline Staff tools and resources to resolve problems on their own. It's almost like they do not trust the same employees they worked hard to hire. Good job but you’re going to earn those flying benefits It’s a great job, could definitely turn into a career if those are your intentions, the people who you work with make the job a whole lot more tolerable for daily work. Like any job there are some people who do the bare minimum which makes it harder for everyone else due to this job being mostly teamwork based. Constantly short staffed with janky equipment that’ll make you work harder if you don’t mind working. fair treatment good place to work good environment fair treatment, They are a great company that will work with you when needed and has great benefits that have allowed me to raise and grow myself and my family Nice place - comfortable and super nice people The company really has its employees backs. Great camaraderie among employees. Pay is ehh and people are ehh in terms of intelligence. Feels like people have been there forever Great job but operations have been a mess This is a great job, but lately (2019 until now) operations have been a mess and seem to be getting progressively worse. Trips are poorly constructed, layovers are short, and flight attendants have been treated like robots who don’t need work-life balance, care, or consideration. There seems to be a lot of deflecting and no accountability from senior management. We’re all exhausted and frustrated. This used to be a great company to work for. I hope it returns to the standard of care and respect it used to provide its staff. Can be ok for some Typical call center environment, but you will definitely be micromanaged. They have an extremely strict cell phone policy so be ready for that! They will annoy you about it. Very long days & nearly impossible to get off when needed, even if you plan well. You’re expected to bid for new schedules four times a year, and what you get is what you get! There are lots of schedule options but most new hires will get Wednesday and Thursday off. Pay is very, very low for what they require of you as an employee. Most people left with the pandemic so the people training you will only have been there for a year and they don’t know much, not mention they are power hungry. Delta does not seem to truly want to help passengers at all, it appears they got to be this popular as an airline because they will do business with anyone (this is not good). Training is a 2 step process, the 2nd step being several months after you start (approx 6 months). Lots of overtime opportunities but even with overtime, pay is still low. Lots of employee appreciation luncheons and things of that nature. Also, no dress code really so you’ll see some of everything. This job is good for some, but not a place you want to stay for long. It's the lies for me They lie right out the gate. Moving up within the company has little to nothing to do with education or anything else for that matter. It's all about who you know! They make it seem like you can move up with no hassle & it'll be easy. NOT! The OSM's never have your back & keep up drama just like anybody else. Everyone plays favorites. Lots of drama & partner swapping. Poor management Delta as a whole is a wonderful place to work! They will have your back if you have theirs. However the management in Philadelphia is all about favoritism, harassment, and insensitive. Hard word but the best job I have had. Delta by far is the fairest company I have worked for. It takes time to get seniority but the pay is fair. After 5 yrs very decent. And the benefits are all over the world. At Delta we are family of 80,000 strong and it shows in our culture. Good workplace I enjoyed my time at Delta Airlines. This is a job where you will have to perform at a high level of expertise and stress. High volume of customers daily. Management was good and supportive. I learned a lot. It’s alright. If you have priorities outside of work, don’t apply. There’s a shift bid and when you first start you’re at the bottom of the list. You can’t hardly call off if needed. Forget about your doctors appointments. Better have child care that never is sick because they don’t give you a pass. However the benefits were nice, it wasn’t enough to make me stay though. Free food sometimes, “flight benefits”, discounts and perks Scheduling, managers, work-life balance Great company to work for Great company to work for if you’re interested in part time hours. Great flight benefits, it just takes time to get an increase in pay. I would recommend Good benefits. Work can be stressful. Long hours, demanding public. Traveling is wonderful. Benefits are outstanding. Schedule flexibility comes with time employed. There is no typical day at work. You must be prepared for anything - emergencies, re routes, cancellations, poor passenger conduct. The most enjoyable part are the places you go and the friends/colleagues that become part of your life. Great place to work I love my job. It’s a great place to work and a great company to grow with. Management is overall great and very accommodating and supportive or your goals! It can be difficult due to shortages and staffing but overall great experience. Terrible company to work at Not good at all specially management does with you whatever the heck they please. You apply for dull time they go ahead and give you part time Also they change every 3 months your schedule and you won’t be able to maintain 2 jobs Best Job Ever....But do your research! I don't try to hit it before so I knew what I was getting myself into. Training is tough, and maybe one of the toughest things you want to do. This is the best job ever but this lifestyle was not for everyone. You will have to move to base or you can try commuting but you have to know how to plan. Your schedule can change a lot in the hours can be brutal. So you want to meet some amazing people on the way! Great Place of employment :))very happy, love my job with delta and plan to be with them for as long as possible. I’m treated like a human here and their very passionate about their employees. Unsure how it is Post Covid Overall, this is a great role for someone who wants to get into management at an airline. People skills are a must. Overall though, i’d recommend working here."
BMO Harris Bank|" Great work balance, management is always supportive. I love working for BMO. Job culture is very supportive and company really cares for their employees. Benefits are good, match 401k, paid holidays and enough PTO. 1 Pays to suffer Prepare to be incredibly over worked and micro-managed. Yes, they pay you well. And the benefits are good, but very pricey. Bosses are inconsiderate and do not provide any support for growth. Good ole boys club. Nice Place to work very nice place to work. feel respected. good environment and enjoy my peers. i would definitely recommend employment here. I have worked with several other large banks in the area and prefer this bank over others. Boss Banking wasn't fun - it was boring. Management was goofy and never made the day any better. I'd like to think that I did a good job in my time there. A Terrible Sales Job A super weird work environment. The day started by drilling sales techniques with coworkers as others watched and critiqued. Very passive aggressive atmosphere. Extreme favoritism. Management wouldn't intervene when customers were inappropriate. I could not recommend a job less. management, work environment, actually a sales job Challenging but rewarding If you like a challenge this job is great. Pay is good, good benefits and bmo is a very generous company to work for. The job itself isn’t “hard” but there is soooo much to learn which brings on the challenge. I enjoyed the job a lot No room for advancement, outdated systems, management, branch locations Antiquated, outdated branch locations and especially computers and technology systems, little or no opportunity to advance or learn on the job, close minded local and district management, on the job to many years and only want to do things “the way we’ve always done it” Not responsive to market, customers, and especially not to team members. There are many other financial institutions and credit unions he will do much better off with one of them if you are seeking a career in this field!!! Amazing Staff and Wonderful Work Environment Excellent Work ethics and you feel a sense of belonging each day you walk into the branch. You get amazing coaching and the company even assigns you a mentor that is an experienced banker to help you succeed. Ever since joining BMO I have learned alot and I encourage anyone to apply for positions here at BMO Bank 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Coworkers become like family. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Compensation is not were other companies are. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Awesome people and company. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Do your assigned work and go home. Good benefits I take calls for all hours of my job, upwards of 100 calls in a busy day sometimes. Good pay and benefits. However very stressful and burnout happens by the second day of the week. Great place and wonderful employees Great place to work! I met alot of interting people and learned alot. Hours were great and it was a plus being off on holidays. Short days every Sat. Plus off every Sunday! Working with others was enjoyable Working with others was enjoyable. The environment was comfortable. It felt like home, and I belong. Managment was reliable and there to help when help was needed. Overall nice respectable place to work. The work was challenging at times, but working with others help it to be manageable. Its good at first.... Later you see that BMO Harris Bank only tries to sell products there really not about culture as they say from my own experience. The market president doesnt think of realistic goals. But very good company with benefits not really anything hard any one can do the job fairly easy. Diverse Culture, Great Place to Work Working in the branch does have high sales goals however BMO does give you the tools and coaching to achieve those goals. Very inclusive and diverse culture. Bmo really takes care of its employees. Pay is above other banks especially when considering quarterly and year end bonus. Great place to work! Unrealistic expectations Great pay and benefits, however unrealistic set goals and I felt there were some unethical practices due to management. A high turn over rate and ongoing training Poor management I hired in 2019. I was to be trained at another branch, drove there for 2 weeks and no training. Of course they made that person a manager and ended up at the branch I worked at. This person was hateful, angry all the time and very unprofessional to staff and clients. BMO needs to get a training area for new employees with skilled people to train new hires. None Work -life balance terrible Is really becoming a bank of pushing products They say that they care for holistic conversations and finding needs but in the background they have fire drills when gaps in sales are happening. Regardless of your activities if your not producing then your on the hook for bad coaching. Great work/life balance I’ve worked for BMO for over two years and enjoy the company and it’s benefits. I also enjoy being able to work from home 100% of the time. Advancement opportunities are there as well. Work from home benefits Ever changing environment Productive and great employees to work with If there was BMO Harris where I was moving to I would definitely stay with the company. Always making improvements to give our customers the best service and services available. Training can be better for the amount of work expected. The pay is great. Training could be better as this job as a high turnover rate. A month of training to learn different systems and bank laws is just not enough time. The Market President is terrific. My ten years at BMO were enjoyable and taught me a lot about banking and customer service. I would recommend friends to work at BMO. Solid leadership and opportunity for advancement. Benefits and pay Lack of advertising in the St Louis region. Great work balance, management is always supportive. I love working for BMO. Job culture is very supportive and company really cares for their employees. Benefits are good, match 401k, paid holidays and enough PTO. 1 elston I was promised to work with a mentor never happened. I work all Saturdays without even being asked. We were two latino employees were notreated poor. Safe bank Politics Bad management - and I mean foolish and stubborn . No advancement opportunities-Management would not consider past employment when it came to advancing your career. Just a horrible place to be when you have more talent than your superiors 2 Direct managers are fine, corporate structure leaves a lot to be desired Same as any other job, starts off fine and asks for constructive criticism and feedback just to throw it in the trash before you’ve walked out the room. Challenging but achievable goals support to reach them, great team orientated environment If you put the work in you will succeed, have become very relationship orientated and all about doing what is right for the customer. Everything based on having great conversations with our customers, need to be willing to grow and change Just don’t work here. Make this a last option but try your best to find another company. It’s a bureaucratic structure that relies on micromanaging. It truly was a toxic work environment. Great work/life balance A lot of companies talk about work/life balance and room for growth but this company actually means it. I’ve only been working here as a part time teller for maybe 4 months but they really work with you when it comes balancing work and your personal life. I still have see if they work with you when it comes to growth in the company but from what I’ve seen and heard, it looks like they keep their word on that as well.. I just have to see for myself. I haven’t had a manager at my branch to tell you about how they work but the manager that looks after us from a different branch is the sweetest. He’s so understanding and works with you. Great atmosphere Great team environment, a culture of inclusion and diversity. Financial partners are very knowledgeable in the industry. Great opportunity for advancement if so desired Strong, Established Company with Inclusive Values They promote from within. Managers are keen on helping you develop in your role and supportive. Collaborative environment with opportunities to cross train to develop additional skills. Tiring but rewarding, sales Heavy focus on sales and not actual customer service. Unfair rules, and again extremely heavy focus on sales. Lots of daily responsibilities with a lot of attention to detail needed to succeed, micromanaging moments occur daily, can be stressful Good company, customer oriented Good company, customer oriented, better decisions from upper need to be made. A lot of changes every 6 months, management changes a lot, not easy on employees or customers as everyone has some different idea. Compensation Healthcare, Wlb Not productive and systems are not updated. BMO Harris core values are excellent but the management staff is not. I’m a new hire an I feel like I’m not getting the support I need. Nothing they plan happens in a timely fashion. The systems are old and outdated so it’s hard to have a real productive day. This is supposed to be a remote position but I’m working out of the office going on 4 months now. Employees are catching Covid and I feel I’m at risk even tho I have been vaccinated. I feel BMO Harris call center needs a complete makeover. ""What you think is common sense is not the BMO way."" Outdated and inefficient. Cons: -Outdated/frustrating systems -High sales goals -Poor training -Call nights -Inputting same information multiple times Pros: -Decent pay -Coworkers On my first day a manager told me the quote in the title. You will spend more time trying to navigate system/policy issues than do the actual job. Save yourself the headache and look elsewhere for banker positions. I have worked for other banks and I would definitely not recommend working for BMO. Training does not prepare you for the role. It only lets you know of the BMO culture. Most trainings are screen shots that are so out of focus that you can't read it, making the material pointless. The trainers know about the issue but they do not fix it. It is a sales job and you will ask the same customers over and over for business. Call nights 1/2 times a week to the same customers. Several errors a day with teller and banker systems. Calling tech support can take a while and most of the time not solve your issue. You will spend most of your day just getting through issues caused by BMO's outdated systems. Opening an account through the BMO website at home is more efficient and easier than the branch systems. Currently you have to put information for a customers profile in one system and put that same info again in other to open accounts. Very inefficient to do the same thing multiple times since they are not linked. Coworkers were nice but always understaffed. Management was great but can tell he was just reporting what had to be done from their manager. My manager left as well from the pressure to cover multiple branches. Good compamy Great company to work for, has good benefits like 401k match, health, vision, and dental insurance. Wages are fair. Supportive work culture but very goal oriented. Great workplace! I was working in the operations department and it was good but the best thing was that the management listened to us and had a great open door policy. Wonderful group of people to work with Wonderful group of people to work with. Care about the employees and build great morale. Flexible with hours. Understand we have a life ourside of work. Pay range is average but it is difficult to move up within the company. The work is challenging and interesting. Wonderful coworkers pay range not at the top Poor management The work itself is fine but , they have extremely poor management. Three months into the banker role i was the only full time banker and had no idea what I was doing and had no support from management. They also lie a lot and don’t seem to care about their employees. When I went on maternity leave the manager told everyone that I wasn’t coming back and they packed up my office and hired another banker. When I came back and tried to talk to upper management about it but they didn’t seem to care. Management title specialist overall work environment was good. Limited room for growth. Flexible hours with lots of benefits. Teller Bad regional manager, doesn’t like to promote within Pay is ok Hours are ok Benefits are good Needs better opportunity outlook for all employees within Micro management So busy having to document every little thing you do that it leaves no time to actually take care of the customer. Management was more worried about tracking information than the actual outcomes. Great place to work! By far the best job I have had. 4 months in and i am appreciated in the smallest ways and rewarded with no only recognition but gifts as well. Being pushed to become better, great benefits, awesome work life balance. Great team that motivates and supports from our CEO down to branch management. Great work balance, management is always supportive. I love working for BMO. Job culture is very supportive and company really cares for their employees. Benefits are good, match 401k, paid holidays and enough PTO. 1 It's really too good to be true Awesome staff, great management, so very many opportunities to grow. The benefits are great and are available even for part time positions, there is paid training, flexible scheduling, paid time off for things like voting and children's school activities. This company really cares about their employees. 1 Great leadership/management and amazing co-workers Position can be stressfull at times depending on what situations arise. Overall, great place to work. Amazing work/life balance. Biggest issue - 5 minute rule: every 5 minutes the rule changes. Difficult to stay consistent. Co workers My only issue was the location. I don't like driving over 30 miles for work. Great team of people. I enjoy the work and co-workers! During the pandemic we were provided lunch and drinks. The management seem to care about their employees. As I wrote earlier, location was my only issue. Money hungry They pretend to care but all they want are referrals. They play favorittes and only care about the business and not the customers. They want every homeowner to apply for HELOCS None Everytthing Tiring but rewarding, sales Heavy focus on sales and not actual customer service. Unfair rules, and again extremely heavy focus on sales. Lots of daily responsibilities with a lot of attention to detail needed to succeed, micromanaging moments occur daily, can be stressful They try hard for a workload balance culture, and promote it. Reality kicks in and sometimes you cannot help but work long hours. Overall, not too bad. There is a lot of change happening. Some of the technology and forward thinking is world class. Not all levels are pulled up to this at the same time, but I expect it will happen over the next few years. The head of our division is great. He does fireside chats and keeps us well informed. He has high respect for his management team and is positive. Great customers, not so great management. During the time I worked there we were severely understaffed (well before covid). Staff was constantly forced to work through breaks and if you didn't leave when you took your lunch break, you would inevitably be called out to the floor. We were often left alone to try to manage both the front and drive through. Thankfully we had amazing customers who were super understanding. Management was zero help. Customers were great. Some of the coworkers were good. Good benefits, pay. Rarely got breaks. Often had to stay over scheduled time. Absolutely NO training whatsoever. Unrealistic goals. Job was vacant when I joined company. Two new bosses in the position. One came from outside the company. No notes, no training, no one knew anything. Unrealistic expectations and timelines. Totally unprofessional from beginning to end. None that I can think of. No training. No desk notes. No one around to ask. Great company Nothing bad to say. Good company to work for and growth opportunities. Good training and management coaches well. Diversity encouraged and appreciated. Good pay, but a lot of micro management Good company over all, but really hard to switch roles or advance. BMO normally hires outside and doesn’t promote internally. Overall not a bad place to work. Decent but benefits could be better Benefits are expensive and deductibles are high. Over all not bad but promotion is always just out of reach. Management likes to make you feel like you can advance but chances are slim. The people were fantastic, everyone got along, supportive team. We worked like a Swiss time piece; stepped up when needed, backed each other up when necessary. We were like a family at work & we supported each other no matter what. In office parties- everyone brought food. My last manager was a dim wit. Great company. Horrible management The company offers three weeks PTO and a couple weeks of sick time even for part time. It's a great company but the manager micromanages you, blames you instead of seeing something as situational, and threatens corrective action on anything. I feel no support from my manager and dread going into work every single day. There is always something for the manager to complain about and she'll pick on someone for the day. The stress of your goal will get you if you do not make it but most of the customers are regulars who do not feel the need to open anything new. At this point, it feels difficult to make a genuine connection when all BMO cares about are numbers. Pto Unpaid 30 minute break Unorganized at some locations Management Job is okay for the most part. Management will be on your back most of the time. Very unclear directions and have to look up most of the things yourself if you want to do things right. I got blamed for something I was taught to do that way and they didn’t really care. good coworker connection management Diversity and inclusion is a top priority for this company. The hours were at times long depending on staffing or call nights. The company offered a lot of opportunities for advancement. If you have the right manager and are willing to adjust your business plan depending on the markets goals you will succeed Amazing benefits for part and full-timers, but work can be lackluster. My location, despite being downtown, was extremely slow. On a ""busy"" day, I'd help maybe 60 people in total during an 8-hour shift, including the drive up. My location was sort of an oddball in that it was ancient (very cool building that also housed different high wealth client employees). One of my coworkers worked at a location by the mall and said their days were nonstop over there. Each person always struggled to meet our sales quotas due to there being few new customers and business runners. My coworkers kept the place feeling alive so that plus the benefits BMO offered it was worth it for me. I liked how BMO offered pretty much the same benefits package to both full and part-timers. Between all the holidays off and paid for coupled with 2 weeks of paid sick leave and 2 weeks of paid vacation time, it really wasn't that bad of a starter job. BMO also made it a requirement to take at least 5 consecutive days off, which was very nice. I was very happy to not get fired during the pandemic and that BMO adapted so I could continue to support my family. BMO also made it a point to give us extra befits during the pandemic, like extra PTO time to get your vaccine and extra mental health days. As far as growth, maybe look somewhere else. Unless you're willing to move around a lot and take several years, it's unlikely that you will see a promotion within the first two years. My manager wished he could have made me a lead teller, but regional management didn't see a need for a lead teller at our location. Despite never getting the ""official"" title unless I moved to a different Coworkers felt like family, getting to know regulars was fun, PTO was beautiful, good health insurance plans High turnover, 3 different managers in a little under a year and a half, always unorganized, Upper-level management could be a bit judgy on physical appearances, Limited options for if you want to move up and takes a long time to get promoted Ok for short term Constant rotation of employees and constantly short staffed. Above branch level doesn't value longtime employees. Poor handling of mental and stress situations during covid. Coworkers are great and support you during difficult times. Once was great to work for. If you thrive on high pressure, this will work for you. Go for what you know The job requirements weren't hard if you don't analyze the work and just focus on making sure you were obtaining good numbers overall. If you wanted to get help with promotions/advancement you wanted to remain on management's good side! In all, you want to just do your work making sure to keep track of your own success because everyone is trying to move around and you would get lost in the mix if you wanted a helping hand. Good people to work with; benefits start right away Was transferring over to be more sales related; more quantitative focused Nice entry level job Nice starting salary for an entry level position. A litt Strict attendance wise but overall a cool company to work at. Training is very lengthy and informative but definitely working. I see this as one of the easier ways to get into the financial and banking industry. Fun work environment with areas to grow Was satisfied over all with my experience, my manager and all coworkers were very helpfull. Due to personal reason i could not continue longer but i would love to work there again in future Great work balance, management is always supportive. I love working for BMO. Job culture is very supportive and company really cares for their employees. Benefits are good, match 401k, paid holidays and enough PTO. 1 Horrible Management - No clue what they are doing BMO implemented a business plan that they would ""lead with financial planning"". Management never followed the directive and so planners did no planning. The department was disbanded, and the leader of the department just left to go with another firm. The Home Office leader also was moved into another department after failing miserably. How this bank makes money is a mystery and the workplace environment was horrible. Paid well. Too many to list Mgmt doesn't care about its employees Upper mgmt couldn't care less about its employees. The ONLY thing it cares about is the bottom line-->MONEY. Terrible company. Terrible benefits. And many more pay favorites! Only company I've been at in 25 yrs that reminds me of high school in that regard!! None Everything Good company but not all managers are good Company pays great benefit, products are okay, management is not good especially the upper level, ceo is great guy but other branches pass a lot pressure to the bottom. Great Co-workers and work environment Co-workers are great and Management is great. Our location is always busy. A lot of opportunity but not enough time to be properly trained. Also short staffed often. I can work on homework during downtime Great benefits, people, and pay Great company. Better than most. However, my manager in particular was weird about me taking sick time (even though I gave notice and had some left) and sales goals weren’t for me. Other than that, everything was great Pay, benefits, culture, people/management Sales goals, some managers look down on sick time It's a call center Managers only care about numbers and the systems are all outdated. My direct manager is great but anyone above her is extremely out of touch with the call center. They will harp on you about average handle time and after-call time but the main system used to access customer accounts is literally based in Internet Explorer and needs JavaScript to run so it's extremely slow. Training was thankfully extensive in the beginning but once you're on the floor you need to be ok asking for help because they don't teach you everything. It's a good place to start but it's a call center 1st, bank 2nd so most people don't last very long. Fun place to work Excelente company ro work. Opportunities to growth and advance if yo put the effort. The only drawback is the amount of work and pressure to perform. Excellent overall Personal time off Disappointing After being an employee at this company for over 10 years it was a hassle to ever be considered for promotions. In addition when escalating issues to employee assistance team we got no support. Big bank Biggest disappointment was the push for sales over customer service. This was a tough adjustment after working for a locally owned bank that valued their relationships with customers. Pay Decent Job Good place to work for. Banker job is all sales so get used to meeting goals. It’s all about who you work for and who you work with is what makes this a good job. Company culture Sales Horrible management My manager is the absolute worst. Regional manager is very conceded. Time is not your friend. Benefits are good. The company will promise you something and never follow thru. There is no room for advancement. Same customers everyday Constantly changing goals and they was they are paid Co-Workers are Amazing Co-workers are amazing. Transportation Senior Management (he) was a joke. They (he) lied about numbers and then blamed the teams for failing to make those numbers. They (he) were constantly angry and threatening to managers and their teams. Leadership (he) does not care about the employees and doesn't even try to pretend to. Decent Salary and benefits Senior Management (he) is a bully and micromanages his managers and their teams to death. Product pushers I had amazing co-workers at the branch I worked at but I could never get over how much we pushed products. Management wasn't there when we needed them. Sales, Sales, Sales The culture has changed as they are looking to grow the business 4x. They have a very good understanding of giving you the tools to successfully complete the sales process. The downfall the focus is on sales, sales. sales and not so much the customer Nice people, good company I enjoy the team I work with. The work can be demanding at times and work life balance is hard to come by but I enjoy the work overall. It is mentally stimulating and the fast paced nature is awesome. Loved working here I had no prior experience before being hired on as a teller. The 2 week training was very helpful and informative. Hours were perfect and paid holidays were a bonus. My coworkers were amazing, they are what made working there fun. I am grateful for all that I learned and the experience I gained while working at BMO Harris. I would not work here When I first started it was a cool place to work. I've been employed for about 9 months and I am ready to quit. Management does not know how to mange not do their own job let alone coach someone. My manager doesn't know how to do her job let alone any other position within the bank. She gets to take off for last minute doctors appointments but no one else does. They want you to make sales sales sales but the bonus doesn't reflect your work at all. So much to complain about, so many people quitting in a short period of time. I would not recommend anyone works here unless you are a yes man and love to do things that is not in your job description. Pto, Sick days, Helping people, Pay okay Management, Health insurance, Everything Some things are great, some not so much I loved BMO's culture (very inclusive). Benefits and pay were also amazing. This is a company that truly does let people work from the bottom up, regardless of education or background. If you do well at your job there is always room for advancement. That being said, the focus on sales is either a) driving your clients away because it's pushing and annoying or b) pushing good talent away because of the pressure to hit sales goals. Also, because of the focus on sales goals, management would be hired based off of their ability to sell and not their ability to lead. Just because someone is a good salesperson doesn't mean they will be a good manager. I worked there for almost 5 years and during that time experienced 3 mass layoffs (all of which I was safe from fortunately) affecting thousands of people who couldn't hit their sometimes impossible goals. Ultimately, if you are a rockstar with sales and proficient in customer service and money handling, you will do just fine and be happy. If you don't like to sell your soul to make a dollar, run. Pay, schedule, benefits, advancement Pushy sales tactics, poor management, job security Laid Back, very inviting office life Overall I cannot say many bad things about BMO. They work incredibly well during Covid, making many agents go remote. They have a very laid back feel and we are able to dress casual, while still being appropriate. My manager is consistently making sure I have the tools to succeed and even mentioned if I ever want to move in another position later on down the road they will help me network to get to that place. The only thing I can complain about is the pay. I feel like working at a bank you’d expect a little more. pros and cons to everything great work environment, lots of events within the community, good benefits, nice cafeteria space pay seems a little low Time off and micromanagement Time off around holidays is impossible to get because it was based on seniority in my department-I wanted to see my family too; rarely was able to leave early when other departments and the branches were closed early for holidays; micromanaging was an issue; small errors were made more of than warranted; employee favoritism was noticeable; management gave very small incentives for various successes; not good raises but year end bonus was decent Paid the bills Boring; micromanagement Great work balance, management is always supportive. I love working for BMO. Job culture is very supportive and company really cares for their employees. Benefits are good, match 401k, paid holidays and enough PTO. 1 Very busy location but fun While working at BMO there was definitely a sense of family. Benefits were great. My management was great. Best co-workers ever. We were very busy and worked hard but that made us better. Flexible schedule. Coworkers. Management. Short staffed Good job Good place to work. Has its pro/cons. Made my life easier being a single mom. Earliest start time is 815, and latest is 515. Only work till 1215 on Saturdays. 1 Nice place to work I work for BMO for three years and it was a really good experience I learned a lot and enjoyed my time with them. I just wish we weren’t let go because of the pandemic. Good Benefits that will be needed Poor Leadership in the Phoenix market, long hours, heavy handed high pressure management, poor technology and no accountability when upper mgmt. fails. Upper management in Arizona has zero clue what they are doing to make real progress, butt kissers elite! Until leadership changes- this market is in a downward spiral. All hires are internal, family working throughout the market and in all aspects, HR, Mgmt, Tellers, Bankers, Corporate and high up control positions, they are all tied in together and control this small market.Watch your back, and make sure to kiss the ring, they can stab you pretty quick and they have the power to take anyone out. I wish there was! Work Life Balance, Leadership, Long hours Taking Calls Worked in their call center taking general banking inquiries and helping troubleshoot online banking issues. Was originally pretty good but then call volume became endless and never stopped being that way. Ask for too much while giving too little. Staffing seems to be a prevalent issue no matte what branch I work at. There's never enough tellers or bankers. It's often that I find myself in drive completely alone taling care of bussiness cloents and regular clients during crazy rushes. They need to update EVERYTHING. Get a new tube system,new cash counters, faster computers, and better ATM's that don't need to be fixed every week! It's rudiculous. Then they have unrealistic sales goals they want you to fufill. Pay and coworkers Everything else Very High expectations Poor management is what keeps this place down. No room for advancement. Love most of the benefits. Research things on your own. No one will help you figure things out. High expectations. Negative reinforcement - lots of stress put on the workers. Fearful of failure and of trying new things. Very toxic environment where the only way leadership felt good was to make others around them feel small. Very unclear objectives, poor communications, They had a cafeteria so you could squeeze in a lunch in under 15 minutes Poor work/home balance- lack of caring about employees Just..Don't. A ton of work - far too much for one person. Management is very nice but needs to work on communicating with one another. This job has a high turnover rate. free lunches sometimes working through lunch break Right off the highway was great It was a bit of favoritism and a lot of miscommunication. They lay off often and the Heath benefits are ok. They pay below the standard salary and if you make above that salary you are one of the first to be laid off. You are just a number there. Location Lay off often and pay is below standard salary Good company lot of mergers It is a good company to work for considering it is subject to the same mergers and splits as are common to the banking industry. Watch your back! The staff there is more interested in making friends and alliances than getting work done. Free lunches and holiday pay A lot of favoritism and clicks in the company Nepotism and zero integrity I was excited to start working there however the atmosphere is a “Do as I say, nor as I do”. Branch Management bends the rules to fit their own personal needs. Hiring family members that actually live with them to work for them at branch. Favoritism towards that person was clear to everyone in Branch. Lots of churning business and working around ways of doing to get paid incentive. Also BCM at another Branch would use the Office after hours to have meetings for her other “ventures” with non bank employees, however if you have your family member come in during work hours, you get written up for it. Rude, disrespectful management and their dress is very unprofessional. District Management is nervous to act on anything, very skittish personality. Amazing Customers Nepotism, unprofessional behavior, lots of churning business There was no ping pong table They were very fair and nice people. Had a really good time working there. The managers there are AMAZING! The benefits were very GOOD. There is sales required there. everything nothing I would not recommend First and foremost the training was not what it was supposed to be we had almost a month of training and it was a lot of information thrown at us and when we finally went upstairs it was like we didn’t learn anything at all. I also feel like our “support” system for help could definitely be improved. Thats just for the work portion. So for pay they told us our pay would be 36,000 yearly but they failed to mention that was included with “bonuses and referrals”. Not only that but our vacation time is not rolled over and we dont have pto so if we have personal issues we have to use “sick time” oh forgot to mention we only have 80 hrs of that for the whole year. Dont get me started on scheduling, we are not able to work Monday-Friend until we have worked here for at least 5 years. So they have this thing called “dream schedule” and its not that at all because yes in the beginning they let us know that we couldn’t have Monday-Friday but they didn’t let us know that we could only pick from Tuesday-Thursday as an off day. All in all i just think the call center isnt a good place to work because no one is upfront and transparent as they claim to be. Also they give you a choice on how long you want your break to be and even if you choose 30 mins they dont even apply it where you would get off 30 mins earlier they apply it to the beginning of your shift so lets say your shift was 9:30am-6:30pm they wouldn’t change it to 6:00pm they would just make your start time 10:00am and you would still get off at 6:30pm Nothing i could think of besides pay Healthcare is very expensive Customer focused and collaborative Customer focused with efforts to complete response on getting the right answer with right product to meet needs. Balance of work load with team members. Never sticks to one plan Initiatives, objectives, priorities announced and discarded rapidly. Plenty of overtime expected, couldn't make after work plans. Canadians treated better than US workers. Good holiday parties. My direct co-workers were great Too many slogans, not enough content. Great pay It's been a couple years, but I was hired as a part timer. Yet I was always scheduled as a full time due to short staff or what not. I was basically scheduled every weekend and could not complain because the other employees requested off. When I made the decision to go back to school and asked to reduce my hours to my actual part time hours instead of overtime, I was discouraged and told ""you'll waste your time trying to get a piece of paper called a degree over getting a bigger paycheck "" I turned my two week notice in that same hour and Manger told me ""you can't come back to the company in the future. I won't refer you"" Let alone the fact that I didn't get to use any of my vacation hours (60hrs) that I earned for pulling overtime when I'm a 25hrs part time. What bothers me most is the fact that I was told it would carry over only to find out my manager didn't approve it before it expired. It was my partner who told me to leave because I was not treated right. When I contacted HR, I was told there needs to be proof as if the extra hours I worked isn't proof enough to show that I didn't get to use any vacation hours I earned or got paid out for it. Other than the negative environment, maternity leave is great and pay is good. Pay Managers don't do their job or value employees. Bank manager Good bank job overall. When I first started as a Banker it was a balanced position. Take care of the customers need and sell them additional services. Bank is very driven to hit sales quotes, even when you do, commission not all that high as banker. Bank manager comes with higher salary, but also a lot more responsibility. Work life balance Only high deductible health plans Ok when it was smaller company Bmo harris grew to quickly and had severe growing pains. They push employees to do more and get more out of the customers but never gave you time to service the existing customers. Once a customer was a customer they expected you to ignore them and only go after new business Good place to work For a large corporate setting, BMO is a pretty good place to work, depending on the management. Benefits are reasonable, but it seems like you have to change jobs within the company to receive a significant raise."
SAP|" Productive workplace and fun table tennis and outdoor balcony space I am a contractor. So, pay is a lot lower. The team's are young so there is a lot of energy here. The management is a bit scattered though and not so sure about direction. Sometimes feel like a little fish in a big sea. Great company with awesome people It’s been a wonderful experience, with many opportunities to develop my sales skills and grow. That being said, definitely take it upon yourself to grow your network and opportunities. Overall, SAP is a great place to work. Great company culture with many opportunities. Sap is a great company and I have enjoyed working here. I’m looking for an opportunity to work part time remotely with no direct reports. A role in coaching and mentoring a sales team and direct customer interaction would be ideal. Marketing Intern Got a bad manager but others who were on the same rotation as me got great ones and had more fun. I pretty much got paid to do nothing. Would steer away from the marketing department though, other parts of the company seem fine. The marketing department specifically NAFM is going into shambles no growth. High Executive turnover lack of leadership What Concur had, fun, consistency, vision, SAP does not have. Benefits are fine. Expectations and stress is high. Raises are minimal unless you graduate to a new pay grade. Promotions if you follow the party line, essentially a Yes person. Good place to work, but lots of processes to follow SAP is a good place to work. I had a very good manager and a great team for the 6 years I was there. Lots of things to learn. It was a very good company to work for. Great manager and team. Our group was let go about a year after we were acquired. So very far away from being great. SAP offers good, competitive salary and flexible work schedules. Their lack of offering sabbaticals for employees with 10+ years of tenure, constant re-orgs. and an endless parade of promotion for only those that are on par with telling leadership exactly what they want to hear fosters an environment of 'just get through it' instead of 'let's go do it' and 'let's try something new'. Frankly, if you are looking for a company that will offer you an average paycheck and mediocre benefits look no further. Never in my life have I heard 'this is how we've always done things' so many times from management. This company suffers greatly from vision, creativity and innovation like I've never seen before, and I've been in the industry for nearly 30 years. Very relaxing environment but bad if you are young SAP is awesome overall, but it's a retirement company with a mixed-reviewed board. People's productivity can be low which is not bad if you're end of your career but bad if you're a younger person. Salary and comp could be much better. Work life balance Compensation Amazing place to work! Really appreciate feeling like I was a part of a team. SAP cares about their employees and promoted employee engagement and moral. Endless opportunities to grow and move around within the company. Great work-life balance and company culture The people are great at SAP. Lots of support and the compensation has always been fair for me. Advancement can be tricky as far as I know, especially as SAP usually struggles with a headcount problem. Great people, sustainable mindset career advancement Very demanding place to work with fair compensation and friendly culture. Working here is an absolute roller coaster ride. In the beginning, training/responsibilities are virtually nonexistent. Management has a difficult time placing you into a niche role, so they allow you the first few months to ease in gradually, and meet as many people as you can. This is the best thing about SAP Ariba. The people are absolutely amazing! They are so nice, hardworking, and always willing to help. Many of them will sit and work through a problem with you UNTIL IT IS SOLVED. Seriously, they will stop what they are doing, and stay with you for days if need be. After your first few months, there will be an urgent role that needs to be filled. (EVERYTHING is urgent in this position.) When there is a hole in a project, you will be thrown in to fill it regardless of your qualifications. There is little to no supervision, so it is all on you to perform This will make you resent the easing-in phase, and wish you had training. SOWs are non-descriptive, so you really never get a clear idea of what your role is, but it seems to evolve constantly. The hours are extremely flexible, and tend to stretch well beyond 8 hrs, but can also shrink to zero. Since the job is virtual, and everyone is in different time zones, there is really never an ""off the clock"" moment. Overall, you cannot beat the compensation, flexibility, freedom, and culture at this company. Unfortunately, those attributes come at a price. The compensation is well-deserved as a result of the never-ending workday that comes with the ""flexibility"". The freedom is short-lived when you realize your entire day is gone, Massive quotas that are often unrealistic Many of the people are wonderful but unethical selling practices are tolerated, no one seems to care that sales reps are selling things clients don't actually need. Loads of micro managing goes on, especially with new Leadership this year. Commissions are often not paid correctly and there is no recourse available when the numbers are off - often by thousands of dollars for a single month. Work/life balance is great but be prepared to struggle to hit your sales quota if you don't want to work more than 40 hrs/week. Excellent benefits and insurance. Great benefits + WFH Options High quotas, high pressure, issues with receiving commission payments Good work life balance SAP has a lot of benefits to employees and good work life balance and flexibility. Lot of opportunities to move with in the organisation including the fellowship program to do part time role in different team Depends on your circumstances It depends on your manager and your team. You do need to be able to stand up for yourself to not be overworked. The fact that it's European rather than American helps with some values. Strong company with good work-life balance SAP allows employees to maintain a work-life balance while being able to grow and advance. Management supports employees and their desire to grow their career and listens to feedback about what areas they would like to focus on. compensation not as high as competitors Employee-Friendly SAP goes out of its way to support employees with benefits, training and other perks. The compensation is fair, but varies by location. Overall a good place for a career in IT. Benefits, perks, training, Some very interesting topics, international company, Get to work with people from all over the globe on a daily basis. Very bureaucratic, Large organization, hard to navigate different teams to find the information you need to do job, Can be hierarchical SAP YPP - What a great opportunity! Great program, divided into several parts, including soft skills and two official SAP certifications, the opportunity is not paid but the benefits and training it offers could easily replace the salary. Great people Good: - The people really are great, supportive, friendly - Great benefits and pay - Great growth opportunities The less good: - Falling a bit behind other companies - They don't make it easy to sell to customers (training is lacking, the tools we use internally (not the ones we sell) are garbage - ""Too many cooks in the kitchen"" moments 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Great diversity and inclusion. Everyone is treated equally What is the most stressful part about working at the company? No actually What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Really chill and motivated German Company bent on hiring their own people in Germany Company bent on hiring people from Germany and invented reasons to terminate their counterpart USA employees. Workday was mostly travel. I traveled 100,000 airplane miles each year especially after 911. I wrote two very successful lucrative payroll manuals and never got any recognition for it. Hardest part of the job was the travel: home on Friday evening, travel on Sunday. Very political company and they manage from top down, period SAP is a very political company and many decisions are based on politics, period. Do not go to HR for any concerns you have about management because they sincerely only represent management and not you the employee. It's a toxic work atmosphere. SAP goes through reorganizations every 10 months and it's chaotic as well. Productive workplace and fun table tennis and outdoor balcony space I am a contractor. So, pay is a lot lower. The team's are young so there is a lot of energy here. The management is a bit scattered though and not so sure about direction. Sometimes feel like a little fish in a big sea. Fun workplace, Its a dream company for many. Fun workplace, Its a dream company for many. I love everyday while working for SAP. I have learnt so many thing in my entire tenure at SAP. I am so thankful to my mentors. Great people to work with. 1 Good company to work for Good company to work for with great benefits and compensation package. Good culture. Good timing. Nice overall compensation. Learning. Spending time with colleagues Highly structured work environment, Workday was quite flexible. Most team members were in by 9AM. Some regular members worked remotely. Remote work was discouraged for me as a contractor. 15 minutes commute from my house, flexible work hours, ample lunch breaks Unpaid holiday and vacation It's a behemoth company and it shows. If you are okay with things moving at a glacial place, you'll be fine here. Leaders are promoted based on favoritism. There is zero transperancy. This is Concur specific. The integration of acquired LOBs is terrrible. Good benefits No accountability for leaders Horrible management in china Joined sap with hope, left because manager forced us to. Always getting bashed about what I do, manager got so mad during 121 many times. Felt extremely anxious the entire time. overtime with no compensation. I’m sure the branches in developed countries would be quite different tho Good work culture Enjoyed my time working here. There’s a special sense of freedom when you work here. Learning opportunities are great and self learning is also possible. Organization politics is key to success or to get promoted Qualifications and hard work do not matter. One with white skin gets promoted quickly. They don't recognize or consider internal employees for promotion rather they like to hire people from outside. If you want to work for rest of your life with no hikes or possibly 1% hike then join this company. Internship was ok... The brand name of SAP is pretty good, but the culture is rather dull. I would say it's a very work-oriented company, and my manager didn't entirely interact with me throughout the process. Additionally, during my virtual daily standups, the colleagues did not even turn on their camera, making it feel like a silo culture. Overall good employee with good bonuses Satisfaction depends on your team assignement how you are satisfied with work Dynamic company Good bonus and competative salary Collective is positive IT Contractor at SAP While it constantly amazes me the level of disorganization that exists across almost all facets of SAP (especially IT practices), it is still a great place to be and the internal employees here are all clearly pleased to be here. Overworked. Expect to work 60 hours + per week. Good company, but way too much work on everyone's plate. I would guess the average employee works 60+ hours per week. And expect to be emailed 7 days a week, 24 hours a day. Remote, flexible work environment, good benefits. Long hours, very political organization-- meaning you get promoted if you're ""in"" with someone, not based on your work. Great people and culture belonging in office and remote. From a contractor perspective. I interacted with a lot of intelligent and friendly people in every department. I never saw any politics being played with to put someone down. Office has a lavish cafeteria and gym. Great management that looks out for their team. Great office, hybrid, or remote work/life balance. Everyone wants to succeed together. Seems to be mainly hiring from within at the moment for certain positions. God experience overall. Salary is lower vs most of its competitors and work live ballance not that good if you want to get involved into multiple projects so you can get continuous overtime pay each month Good envoronment Lots of benefits Lots of trainings Low salary vs competition Not that good work live balance Great place to work Great management, customers and co-workers. Great place to work. Clear expectations, annual feedback and reviews. Fair compensation with the ability to earn large bonuses. international travel international travel Good company with lots of opportunity I enjoyed my time at SAP. It was high energy and fast-paced. People approached challenges with curiosity and enthusiasm. Because of the company's size, there were always opportunities to move into a new role or new department. It was a very sales-driven culture, so many roles were 24/7, which sometimes made work-life balance a challenge. Great people, good benefits, lots of opportunity Sometimes challenging to maintain work-life balance Not bad but not what they try to portray It’s not a bad place to work. Like all large companies there are politics. I’ve was happy here but corporate culture has taken a nosedive. Time to find a less stressful position that actually takes advantage of my skillset. Great leave policy Promotions not done on merit. Some of the management need basic people skills 101 Great place to work for This place is a very comfortable place to work for, the only problem as SWE is the proprietary work that they have, and it seems that is only inevitable with the size of the company. Definetly a great place to work SAP is definelty the most flexible company to work at. Work life balance is great and you will always be recognized for you job. Working environment is also really good, people are usually respectful and nice. Flexible Salary not very competitive Chill Great WLB, mostly chill. Average pay, no stocks, minimum bonuses. Good people and culture. Amazing PTO. Sick leaves. Management needs to improve their understanding of the competitive landscape. Great so far Great place. Nice people, good benefits. Been working at SAP for 10 months. There seems to be a lot of opportunity to move around inside the company once hired Great colleagues Can't think of any Productive workplace and fun table tennis and outdoor balcony space I am a contractor. So, pay is a lot lower. The team's are young so there is a lot of energy here. The management is a bit scattered though and not so sure about direction. Sometimes feel like a little fish in a big sea. Very few leaders based in US; lots of talent drained Be sure to read analyst reports on the stock. Not sure now is a great time to be part of this company so do your diligence carefully on the company's financial strength and forecast. 1 Very supportive and friendly I worked as an intern there for summer 2020. Every person I worked with was friendly, supportive, helpful, and patient. It made me feel grateful. I assume it depends on the team, but I highly recommend SAP. Cant beat working the shows at this gig. Fed me,hooked me up with tibkets to events Stationary engineers use their brains and their tools here. Teamwork is important to management and rank and file. There is a buzz of excitement hanging in the air ambitious goals and outstanding engineers/architects Good benefits Plenty of opportunities for learning Management can do the talk but struggles to do the walk flexible time program no flexible location program Most teams are collaborative lunch, flexible time program not dog friendly, tied to one office location Great work environment Great work life balance; management and co-workers are accessible and very helpful; opportunity for professional development and advancement is emphasized Really ok company Worked there a while ago, but really an ok company. Not always cutting edge tech, or doing fancy stuff, but really stable, sometimes laid back, all in all a place I'd recomend Great Place to Work I joined SAP Concur 2 years ago and have really enjoyed the team of people I work with. I have a tremendous about of flexibility to be creative and explore other opportunities in my role. I love the people I work with as they are sold professionals, supportive, and willing to help when you need it. My manager is super supportive of my career growth. The pay very well and the benefits are great. Flexible work environment, good work/life balance, tremendous benefits. Lots of moving parts and sometimes overwhelming being part of a big company structure. Busy Work at SAP is fast-paced and can be challenging to keep up with. The teammates are generally great to work with, but upper management doesn't signal clearly what they are doing with particular teams or divisions. Overall a good company to work for Overall a good company to work for. Sometimes it can be so busy it’s hard to focus on development and have a proper work life balance but there is a lot of support and people seem to really care. Great work environment with great people I have worked at SAP since 2016. There is no company like it. The people are amazing - smart, collaborative, kind. The longevity of employee's tenure here speaks for itself. Good company for retirement Sap is a good company w/ inclusive culture, good benefits, good base salary but not good equity plan. My managers are changing rapidly as top management kept changing. Good work life balance Politics, low equity Excitement from Board on North Star The culture is toxic. Management favors those in like group or geo location. HR knows but agrees it is what it is. There is no career advancement for females. SAP is an amazing company with strong culture I have worked at SAP since 1998, with an 11 year break to raise my kids. There is no company like it. The people are amazing - smart, collaborative, kind. The longevity of employee's tenure here speaks for itself. Compensation, benefits, teamwork, People, opportunity A very high performance environment which can be stressful at times Americas HQ - Awesome environment, great people. Fast-paced environment in a matrix-managed organization with lots of growth opportunities. Very stable company, profitable every quarte I was there. Terrific co-workers. Excellent benefits, company subsidized employee cafeteria. Annual bonus. High expectations / low budgets. Good work life balance but no chance of promotion Solid company. Great benefits. Job security is not an issue as they do not layoff folks. While the company offers training and a career path, promotions are far and few between. Even moving from one department to another is a bit ridiculous. Benefits, Pto, work life balance. Promotions not given. Lots of dead wood in the company that they refuse to let go. Great place to work SAP is a great company with a strong employee friendly culture. Everyone is generally helpful and there are always interesting projects to work on. Great Company SAP has a great work culture with lots of opportunity. Though with a 100k+ employee company you can feel like a number at times. Managers are great but should take more ownership on developing talent. Many people have left due lack of upward mobility. Pay, benefits, flexible work schedule It’s ok For the most part I like it. It is hard and can get frustrating. I don’t like the interaction as a contractor. My manager doesn’t seem to know what’s going and it’s usually a brush off or “i don’t know” sorta thing. I don’t get PTO which sucks. I work the weekend shift so basically no saturdays or Sundays off gotta ask for permission. I also don’t get a lunch break on the weekend. And OT is a joke (I get it only if it’s over 30mins my end kid shift and I don’t get paid to put notes in). Whether I’ll be hired on or not is about as clear as bacon grease. Remote Strict schedule, no OT, no PTO, no lunches on weekend shift Top-Class workplace When I worked at SAP, they implemented 360 reviews to assess their management and improve their culture, and that led to a lot of really great results. I miss working there! Autonomy, high trust, flexibility, and creativity as an enterprise, things can move slowly, but this always benefits the end goal. Great WLB WLB is very chill and coworkers are friendly. Compensation is also good depending on where you’re living. However, the technologies are outdated which can be a big con if you’re looking to switch companies in the future. Wlb Old tech Productive workplace and fun table tennis and outdoor balcony space I am a contractor. So, pay is a lot lower. The team's are young so there is a lot of energy here. The management is a bit scattered though and not so sure about direction. Sometimes feel like a little fish in a big sea. Great place to work Most flexible and place where you can possible to dream to work for. You can learn whatever you want and gain great experience. No stress, and gets sufficient time for the task. Work environment Great company to start your career with. SAP strives to be a leader in the global market. They care strongly about their customers and their people. Great place to work and grow. SAP is the top business as a service, outcome-based, and customer-focused organization on the planet. I am grateful to be part of a team that drives for customer success every day. Focus on customers, employees, and outcomes! Work-life balance, back office work, and role definitions Productivity There is balance between work and life. Growth and development is guaranteed, there is a large community support and at the same time a protected niche. Human development Great Place To Work Perhaps the most admired company because of diversity, inclusion and work life balance and professional environment. Great support from management to help you succeed in your career Work Life Balance None Great job, lots of oportunity Worked here many years and had lots of opportunities to do different jobs. Great people work here but a lot of organizational churn. Most management is ok, some outstanding. Decent employer SAP really cares about its employees. They had every opportunity to do layoffs during the pandemic and worked hard to find new homes for employees. They respect your time off and I've almost never been asked to work past 5:30 or on weekends in my time there. However, compensation is fairly low, management is constantly changing strategies, and opportunities for advancement are unclear. It's hard to know how to move up in the company. Lots of learning resources if you seek them out, good job security Unclear advancement, lack of support on improving yourself Good benefits and pay. It's very sad to say that since the company has changed direction to be mostly a Cloud company, it's gone way downhill. A huge restructuring is in process. Jobs are being merged and the amount of work and stress is overwhelming. Working 60 hours a week or more is the norm. Benefits and pay Stress, overworked It's what you make of it; resources & good pay are there Good company, cool people, great pay, loads of flexibility. The company is so big however, so sometimes employees are left to ""figure it out"" and there can be little direction at times which can be overwhelming Great Copany It's a corporate job so of course, it's a lot of work and things are constantly changing so you are also constantly learning but SAP really invests time and money into having all the right resources to make your job easier and more efficient. I really have no complaints about this company. Free lunch, remote work, great insurance lots of work Teamwork SAP is an awesome company of people who work as a team to meet or exceed customers' expectations to run their business with software that provides best practices for data management and decision-making. teamwork n/a Productive fun place to work I have been and employees with SAP for close to 10 years and have the opportunity to excel with help from my SAP mentors and colleagues. There is always training and programs to help employees grow with knowledge base learning opportunities. Free lunch, health insurance, free gym membership, free coffee and snacks, free parking, 5 personal days per year, unlimited sick leave, 401 K, wellness programs, training seminars Commute, travel time, tolls Good compensation Good compensation workplace culture super Job Work/Life Balance is awesome Compensation/Benefits best , Job Security/Advancement is also very stable. Senior Solution Manager Jumped from strategy consulting to this new role at SAP. So far very happy with the move. Comps slightly lower than my time with consulting but much better work-life balance and nice people to work with. Plus SAP itself is moving into the next chapter in company history thus I do see a lot of opportunities to grow with the company going forward. work life balance; nice culture; very interesting work management should be more aggressive in setting goals to compete in the market Great to their employees SAP cares about its employees and take care of them even during the current pandemic they are making sure we are safe and have the work life balance we need to care for ourselves and our families. work life balance none work is very independent It is a great place to work and to work there is enjoyable. People were smart and knowledgeable. Work was at the pace you set it. My typical day was reading what needed to be done and work on the projects that were assigned to me. Supporting management in their tasks on special projects for certain clients from presentations, to new development projects, to partnerships. Hardest part of the job was trying to find the right plane to fly home on. Most enjoyable part of the job was meeting the timeline given for a project and knowing I did my best and management was appreciative of the work I had completed. Flexible work style grew very quickly Management was all over the map without good focus Reorganizations every 6 months were very disruptive with poor execution and rationale. Far too focused to benefiting German segments of the employee base. No effort to review projects' success or failure versus the money invested (no ROI). With the exception of HANA, only new ideas were purchased with acquisitions. Great benefits and compensation Poor execution in direction, inexcusable behavior in customer facing, non-sales oriented interactions Productive but not alot of room to grow The job was fine however there was not a lot of room for growth and management was focused on re-organizing instead of developing the individual team. Best company to work for Worked here for over 10 years. Great place to grow! I started as a contingent work. Fully hired after 1 year and able to apply for internal roles as FTE. Free lunch and great benefits Culture not inclusive to African Americans Self service Be prepared to do everything in you own without much support. My very first day there was no welcome. I was handed a box and the receptionist pointed me to a conf room and told me that was where I was to get set up. The box contained my laptop with printed instructions on how to connect to the network. I joined a remote meeting for new employees where an overview was presented. Later in the day, my new boss sent me an email to check in. This describes the culture of the company- you just have to figure things out on your own. Don't expect any warm and fuzzy welcome. Free lunch People are workaholics and expect you to be one as well Productive workplace and fun table tennis and outdoor balcony space I am a contractor. So, pay is a lot lower. The team's are young so there is a lot of energy here. The management is a bit scattered though and not so sure about direction. Sometimes feel like a little fish in a big sea. Great company Best part of job is sense of accomplishment in helping customers and colleagues. Always learning about products and customers. Following-up on resolution of problems can be tedious. Helping customers Following-up on resolution of problems can be tedious. 1 Internship at SAP One of my best career experiences. SAP is a diverse, great place to work with solid career development initiatives. Great leaders , flexible home office policies and great benefits. A great place to work! My time as a contractor ended when COVID19 hit and I was sad to go. The people there are worth working for. They are collaborative, provide guidance while letting you learn and grow as you learn the ins and outs of a large billion dollar company. SAP truly values their employees and encourages you to better at what you do. It's a great start-up vibe with full support from a billion dollar company free lunch, snack Pay is low and management quality is inconsistent Their pay is much lower than others in tech industry for similar jobs. Their insurance provider is United, which is HORRIBLE! Had two different managers. First was great and I'd still be there if I still had that manager. Second was horrific, and she lost most of the team she inherited. I suppose that's the way it goes with large companies. Best place to work Good work-life balance and you can manage your personal and professional life well, good culture, people oriented, and caring. Very talented, helpful and hardworking people. Free lunches, good benefits, lots of perks, personal development and training opportunities SAP Solutions Architect Responsible for managing SD deliverables, Integration with CRM, Portal and Commission Management systems Designed and implemented all Order To Cash processes, including complex pricing (price list with tiered pricing, specific contract price, Not to exceed contract prices), derive commission percentages based on price levels, and then split the commission by team(s)/sales rep(s) Interfaces with Microsoft Dynamics CRM, Incentive Compensation Management system, Portals – Order tracking, Responsible for data migration Worked on Multi level availability check where stock/production plan exists at either finished product or semi-finished products. Feel like Family Fantastic pay and benefits - best I have ever had. SAP treated all employees with dignity and respect. Fantastic product line touching all industries, with best in class software and support. Great products, dynamic and exciting customer base, Great job support You never win an argument with the Germans Mature cloud company, no RSUs Joined a mature cloud company. Concur is the leading product. Paying the bills of a suffering SAP company. Great tools, not enough focus on taking care of their people. No RSUs on hire. Internal Policies are not followed Although one of the front tech companies in the world, it is fractured between different countries and subsidiaries. There is no protection or resolution of a mismanagement. Do not expect that your salary will be matched with the industry standards after hire Good Great place to work and many opportunities for growth and to learn different jobs and advance to management. If uou choose to a place you can retire from Good Culture This has been a great place to work. The job is demanding but everyone helps each other out. I would recommend this to any of my friends. Really great Needs Work Really needs to work on culture. Senior leadership is biased to long-term employees, inclusion is difficult. High turnover in leadership roles. Senior leaders have definite respect issues, swearing at employees. They need to step back and look at culture losses is past two years. Great people, inconsistent cultures combining SAP with Concur Lots of reorg's with continually changing priorities. Processes being built and promoted but did not have enough input for successful adoption. Very flexible with working remote and great benefits. Benefits, Work Life Balance Lots of heavy processes Just Okay If you enjoy a really large matrixed corporate environment and all the supporting benefits, this place may be for you. The culture is just okay. I don't find SAP to be truly family friendly. A solid place to be an intern The Palo Alto office spearheads progressive initiatives of a relatively traditional large corporation. This makes a lot of employees feel as though they could/should leave for more competitive organizations within the Bay area. Although this was the case, for an intern they paid pretty competitively, the benefits of two free meals a day are huge, and I felt like the work I did was meaningful and appreciated. Flexible and inspiring This is a great company to work. There are many drawbacks as people were come and go in the organization so you will need adjustment periods every time you start your work, but these are very talented people so the time to form the performing team is minimal. If you don't check the correct ""boxes"" you'll be stuck. If you are a white male who hits your numbers year after year but can't check any boxes for political correctness in advancement you have little chance of moving up. Just do the absolute minimum to get by, as it's not worth your extra effort. I learned the hard way. Kept hitting my numbers and never got anywhere before I left. If you are a minority who never hits numbers but checks lots of boxes so the numbers look good, the sky's the limit. This company cares more about more about their ""quota"" folks than if you actually do a good job and should be promoted up. Work life balance Great global company. Provides Work life balance. Supportive management, great coworkers. Some positions can be remote. Lots of growth opportunity. Highly recommended I like working at the SAP center. With flexible hours making my own schedule I can easily work another job around this job. Highly recommend this job if additional part-time job is needed. Step Child Our group was part of a buyout. They never took time to understand our systems and quickly tried to outsource the work to Asia with disastrous results. The transition took over 2 years and when that failed, they moved the work to Argentina. So spent a significant amount of time training new people while still keeping up with our normal workload."
Webstaurant Store, Inc.|" Generally good Generally good place to work but one has to ensure they do what is necessary to fit into the culture. Culture is king and if you don’t work within those boundaries it can be difficult. Avoid unless short term This company is ridiculous. Talk to any order picker that works there and unanimously they will say that they are constantly under stress to keep their jobs. Its a meat grinder type environment, pay really well and then demand impossible expectations so you can move them out and start another group at base pay. You are expected to maintain a PERFECT accuracy count. There are no exceptions and will be terminated if you do not maintain a 99.9% accuracy . They preach that your ""fit"" into their core company satandard and being a team player that they care and youre not just a number..they will base your raises on your personality and attitude and fire you based on your numbers. It's all just nonsense to keep anyone from getting anywhere unless you're buddies with someone in charge. If you need quick money , get in , get paid and look for somewhere that actually is interested in keeping their employees . Poor leadership and lots favoritism displayed with just their friends Webstaurant is a company that does not reward hard work, they show favoritism to their friends and they offer no job security. They are corrupt from the top down. 1 Backbreaking work with no raise I worked my butt of....and didn't get a raise. This place is a joke. Way too much work for one person. If you don't make their numbers they will fire you. Manangers shouldn't be put in charge of a lemonaide stand! Did I mention no raise? Too good to be true, be warned After completing a 4 interview process and feeling this was the right fit, I left my job of over 5 years to join this company in the drop ship Coordinator- vendor specialist team. I was so excited for this new journey and I am writing this still in disbelief over the actions against me by my team leader. I was let go because I did could not align myself with the beginning of a book they promote called ""An Ideal Team Player"" but I did agree with the core fundamental principles (hungry, humble and smart) that the book ultimately delivers as the universal backbone to a strong candidate and/or current employee. Last week, I was bragging to friends and family about how nice everyone seemed and I felt confident that I could succeed with Web. The culture seemed to click with my core beliefs and I felt like I had a strong team leader that would support, guide and develop all of my skillsets that I already came to them with and also allow me to eventually contribute further once my basic abilities of my new roll were on point with company standards. After only 1 week they let me go. I went into that meeting thinking we were going to go over my future responsibilities and my assessments only to find out that in fact, I had just accepted a meeting into my exit interview. I asked several times what I had done wrong, if we could find a resolution to a misunderstanding and ultimately I entered that meeting not knowing that the decision of my termination had already been made and the only explanation is that I apparently ""hated"" the book and I offended the idealism of the company by a portion Work from home, decent pay No second chances, overly sensitive, terrible leadership experience If your at the time of your life where a company you work for is as Important as your Time then Webstaurant is the Fit for you. Our Core beliefs Are Hungry, Humble, and Assertive. There's a 60 day trial period to where your assessed to see your Hunger to Push hard while holding a possitive attitude and always having the ability to be Above Average and Doing things Right the first time. Excellent Company to Grow, Supervisors and shift leads, are Quite Exceptional People, They have the ability to work right beside us, to Hit our Goals, If your a hard worker, and wanna job were all coworkers working just as hard as you, then you'll love the pay and the atmosphere. Long hours, Fast paced Wearhouse, Hardest but most rewarding job, I've ever had., Choosing what department, fits you best is Important, to your Career here, if you don't meet there requirements, you'll be let go on your 60 day marker, if your not a hungry being that strives under pressure. Fast-growing company with supportive customer service culture WEB was the first corporate job I received out of university. I found the mentorship and company culture I was looking for. Open communication is highly encouraged to develop improvement. The Customer Solution section of the company was amazing, but I recognize my experience was different than those in the warehouses. I feel that management was very transparent and hands-on when it came to transitions. Employees care about each other and are always looking to offer guidance. There is money to be made, but you are going to work and earn every penny you make. Good pay and work, work, work...Busy, but it can be interesting and at times frustrating. It is a good company to work for, no doubt. The expectations can yet become stressful, when you don't meet metrics. The work load is challenging at times, but it is what you make it. Decent Place to Work Just starting up , so there’s still some kinks to work out. Good thing about that, a lot of openings. They tend to hire from within and you could move up pretty quick. Starting pay is also the highest paid of the warehouses in the area. The worse part is the downtime of not having work, at work. But that will soon be over when they get themselves established. Management The managers are very unprofessional. There is a lot of favoritism that goes on at this job. They don’t care about you as a person or what issues you may have going on as long as you come to work and make their company money that’s all that matters to them. 10/10 Would Recommend WebstaurantStore offers so many wonderful opportunities at different levels and locations across the US. Their passion for healthy culture and developing their employees goes above and beyond. They also provide quality, efficient, and fast products and solutions to their customers. wok-life balance, career opportunities Don't do it The upper management didn't know what they were doing. They hired me to run a department and wouldn't let me run it. They didn't want to be proactive and deal with things be fore they happened they wanted to wait till after thing happened to adress the issue Management is your HR don't recommend if hard worker The company says one thing and does another, they say they care about you when they really could care less. their culture fit program is a load of garbage. If you don't fit in or have a voice might as well leave because you will get fired over it never seen a place such a mess and feel like management is a clut. And if your okay with management being your HR so If you have a problem with there actions I advise you to shut up because they will find a way to fire you. They also write people up on hear say and feed of drama so if your a good worker they don't care they say they've never fired somebody for performance problems only for culture problems so if that tells you about this company I don't know what else does so yeah don't recommend if that does not sounds like a place you wanna work and all the current employees see this and just deal with it and are absolutely miserable and is getting worse daily Fun Place Great place to work that appreciates the hard work. management takes care of the team and they actively work towards a great culture. This is a fantastic place to work. everything nothing Highly don't recommend I was there for over 6 years and it's only gone down hill. Terrible management who only want to be bosses and not leaders. Higher ups are all power hungry and don't look out for the better of the employees. They say one thing, do another. They threaten write ups with lies because they know people can't say anything back without criticism or getting in trouble. If you are planning for your future, find somewhere else. If you care about doing the right thing, find somewhere else. You will lose your job doing the right thing. The whole system and all the higher ups need replaced, without a doubt. Free soda machine More than I can type Bad management The management show favoritism. Not a good place to work unless you like mess .the rules change everyday .It seems like your job get threatened everyday Money’s great, poor environment Most associates are cool and down to earth, all within a productive environment but leadership and communication is on a low spectrum and doesn’t seem to be easy to move up unless you’re a yes man. Boring but fast paced Very ease to get the ag of over time, you get a 60 day period to mess up before you have to hit numbers. 4 10 hour shifts is great in my opinion and opens up your weekend a lot. Would not recommend if you seek growth You are pretty much kept in one position unless you end up in the ""in"" crowd. Opportunity for growth is extremely lacking unless you are essentially a yes man. Leadership has no communication skills with their employees, and no one had the their best interest for the employees. They seem to only care about management and leadership. Non supportive management for upper level positions Best off staying at a base level position with this company. As long as you’re meeting your expectations and staying to yourself you will succeed. Moving up you will find yourself in a totally different work environment. Poor support from management on all levels, extreme criticism, nonproductive meetings, nearly impossible goals, etc. Fast-paced environment with LAZY management I learned and did everything I was supposed to do they had an excellent training program where they basically held your hand for an entire week before they threw you out there to the hyenas. however I wasn't welcomed with open arms. If you're not immediately welcomed into the clicks that are at this job you will be an outcast probably made fun of and they will do whatever they can to make you look bad so they can get rid of you no matter how hard you work. (Even by Force feeding you all the largest orders) And honestly having to listen to mariachi music at 7:00 a.m. is not the most pleasant sound being that I'm not a morning person. I also don't respect how the leads, supervisor and manager sit down all day and literally do nothing but brouse around on the computer and chit chat. They should be leading by example PERIOD but they all have grown comfortable and lazy with their positions. Which makes it a very unmotivating environment. The only decent thing was location and pay which can be obtained from another employer. Generally good Generally good place to work but one has to ensure they do what is necessary to fit into the culture. Culture is king and if you don’t work within those boundaries it can be difficult. Decent pay but high expectations I thought my manager was great, as well as all of my coworkers. My only gripe was that management had very high expectations for content production. It seemed excessive at times. However, i think it is a good company with good people. 1 Thank you for your feedback. We are glad to hear you enjoyed your manager and co-workers. Employees meet regularly with their managers and they are encouraged to discuss any concerns regarding workload and expectations. Your feedback has been shared with management for further review. Great place to work ! Great pay , culture is very important (meanings all around attitude at work) , lots of room to move up and many shifts with hours that work for everyone! No complaints 2 Thank you for your review! We value our culture and growth opportunities for employees. Good company to work for Training was awesome. Huge knowledge download and you continuously learn each day. Co Workers were great in the remote environment. Pay was amazing. Pay, Training Work load Absolutely love my job The best plays hands down I’ve ever worked for! I have the best management and the best team workers! Just do your job! I mean after all it is what your suppose to do! 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? The people What is the most stressful part about working at the company? The management What is the work environment and culture like at the company? If you aren't fiends with management you won't get far. People who are there for three months get promoted over people there for a year What is a typical day like for you at the company? Stressful. They ask for high goals and not enough people to do the work Job is enjoyable This company really takes the time to separate themselves from the rest. I've been here for a few months and I truly believe that the culture is what makes the place. If you truly embrace the culture and truly embrace what the managers here say to us for growth and listen to the feedback, then you can see that the intentions are good. I'm happy coming to work and so are most of the employees I interact with. I really feel valued here and have even mentioned to some coworkers that we all got improvements and working hard on improving those then we will be successful Employee appreciation. Pay. Management Some employees aren't receptive to feedback Not a good place Employees do what they want. There's no structure and so little respect. There's no organization. Management is the worst. We get a lot of complaints from customers because orders will sit in the floor without paperwork. The appreciation lunch a month you will think they feeding the homeless. Pay ok Terrible with the food choices a month Great place to work and make a honest living we're everyone treat's each other like family I enjoy coming to work with a group of people who have each other's best interest at heart from management to employees the wage is a good wage and it goes up depending on your work performance Enabling and Encouraging place to work Working at Webstaurantstore has been nothing but positive, it is a great company that has a lot of growth and opportunity for anyone coming into the company. Great place to work I love the team I work with, my supervisors are great, the culture is better than any place I have worked before. The pay is good for the area. 3 weeks paid vacation after your 1st 60 days. Our location is brand new and is doing amazing. Got fired on my birthday! Company preaches culture & does the complete opposite. Fired me on my 60 day review ON MY BDAY! They could care less & have zero empathy for you as a person & if you’re a hard worker. All the management are either married, in relationships with each other or family members. Absolute favoritism all around the board! Tries to divide hard workers if they are having too much fun & getting along too well WHILE working hard. Company is a total joke! A real waste of time working here. They are no better than any other warehouse in Aberdeen. 3 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Pay and benefits What is the most stressful part about working at the company? meeting quota & the stress that goes with it Nothing bad to say about working there I enjoy working there good environment to work in nice people they put you through training to help you with your job safe work environment and the pay is great More cons than pros They don’t care about their employees. Management sucks, a lot of favoritism and you will not grow. Everybody get paid the same no matter if you work 20 times harder than the next person. Your hard work gets looked completely over and their is absolutely no raise every six months that worth anything, they say 88 cents every six months, LIE. They feed you lies in orientation and it be the total opposite when you’re on the floor. I suggest looking for other options. I’m currently in transition someplace better. Pay well If you looking forward to growing with a company I strongly suggest seeking elsewhere. Horrible Management and uncomfortable work environment! Don't waste your time. You will get fired for nothing if you're deemed ""not a good culture fit"". Regardless of perfect attendance, great team work, and/or grea work ethic. You will get fired even if you have all of this. Great Employer Great job if you’re not afraid of active work. Great pay for the area, with good benefits. Culture, pay, and leadership are constantly improving. It’s nice to see employers that put forth the same effort they expect from you. Great employees to work with, fun job when its busy with actual work to do. Terrible management The job is actually very easy. You will unload trucks with Forklift or by hand, you will putaway the items into floor bins and racking, load trucks with forklifts and by hand, box and setup product to be shipped out. The benefits are pretty good, you will get 3 weeks paid vacation after your 60 days of being there and they have many health and other benefits too. The problem is they only promote friends not the best workers, they will make up any excuse to not promote you and will not give any reason to why they choose a friend to do a job they've never even done before. They will make you do work and than even if you tell them that's not the best way to do it they'll make you do that and than ask you to do it again the way you told them to do it at the start. Jobs amazing but management really keeps this job as a time kill to get paid. Worst Job Ever This job was a waste of time. All this company care about is there product. My son had doctors appointment and they tried to take a point from me because I chose to take my son. Management and co workers walk around looking down on you. Management shows favoritism to other workers. It’s hard to find good help without attitude. This job should pay more than $17 for the work packers do. Monday thru Thursday Short breaks, hard work for women Woke culture, cut-throat leadership. Here is what you can expect from this employer: Fast growth, lots of opportunity, and fair pay. What comes along with that? Woke culture that prefers youth over experience, so imagine that as your manager. Along with youth comes arrogance and ambition that means all the way up to executive leadership you can expect people who will destroy those under them to ensure their path to advancement stays secure. They talk constantly about culture, but it's more recruiting pitch than reality. Culture is used more as a tool to fire the people who they don't like than it is a standard that is upheld at all levels. Doing quality work and following policies is not enough. You'll hear a lot about hungry, humble, smart. Leadership loves to pretend humility (and integrity) but the further up you go the more scarce both become. It all comes down to hungry and smart. Executive leadership doesn't care about the reality on the ground, just the perception to the next level up. If you can play the game of skewing metrics to look good (hungry), and you're smart enough to spin that to those over you - you're going to do well here. If you care about integrity, run away from this place. Good pay, decent perks, lots of opportunities if you can keep up with the growth If you're not millennial and woke, I recommend shutting down all your social media if you want to work here. It’s cool Work and life balance is bad but i worked night shift where it was 5-330 , Most people mess up because of attendance which is insane but they will wear you out eventually . Pay can be increased every 6 months too pay work Generally good Generally good place to work but one has to ensure they do what is necessary to fit into the culture. Culture is king and if you don’t work within those boundaries it can be difficult. Productive and Repetition I worked night shift 5-330 so it was good just to work 4 days out the week . Should change to weekly pay but with raises every 6 months i think it’s good for the money. Wages Management Thank you for your feedback! We appreciate your review and have shared your feedback with management for further review. Great company! This company is hands down the best place to work! They care so much about their people and invest in their devlopment. They are inclusive and reward hard work over tenure at the job. Management is great and the culture is unlike any where else! 2 We are happy to hear that you are enjoying your time at the WebstaurantStore and appreciate you highlighting the culture and great management. Thank you for your review! I don't feel supported in my job by my boss I feel like I'm not fully supported by my boss And his boss. Other departments are not like mine. I enjoy my time at work most of the time. Grounds managers are wonderful and very supportive. Great place I have had a great time here. Sure the hours are long but you get used to it and the pay is good. I really don't have any complaints. The manager is great. Productive and fun place to work Always a great day when you get to work for such a fun and energetic group. An amazing understanding for real life issues and willing to work around employees faults to be able to allow the employee to succeed in the areas they are great at. People in the company don’t want to see other win. Some people that work in Baytown for this company is something to deal with. Especially the younger people. They too busy worried and having your name in that mouth putting you in the spot light. Regardless if you working or not. If they unhappy w your position(cause they want the position you have) so they dry hate on you. They’ll fire you if you take over 5 mins on your break when it was many other doing the same but it’s definitely favoritism going on and the building just open. Watch your back man! Terrible management with no growth or development Look elsewhere. This company preached growth and development, but was unwilling to help employees achieve it. Management is known for “sleeping” with each other and no one does anything about it. Unfair and unpleasant place to work. No job security. Benefits and pay good. BAD MANAGEMENT… Only friends of managers get promoted. New positions are created for they buddies, always with a substantial hourly rate. If your not in their click, you get treated unfairly. Mandatory overtime, Overall warehouse atmosphere is dismal. 70% of employees are working, and the other 30% are always wasting time. On cellphones, eating/drinking, talking, wandering around warehouse., with no repercussions. Insane employee turnover.. No job security. If a supervisor takes a dislike to you, they will get you terminated. Go to work in the morning, and they will fire you a half hour before you finish your shift. No one ever gets terminated in the morning. Employed for 5 years… It was a great place to work when management came from the company’s headquarters . Management is now all local, with disregard of company’s policies and procedures. Good pay and benefits, Employee discount, Annual raises Local management, No job security, Very high school atmosphere, Back stabbing fellow employees is a daily norm Productive environment but not a fun place. Really good development practices, good 401k match but people won't look around as most of them will be focused on their laptops, there's a game room but no one will spend time there as management count how many hours you've spent with your laptop open 401k Match, good development practices 10 PTO days, company culture Bad management of workers and work in general Working here is simple but due to how managers run things here it often makes the job hard much more difficult than it needs to be. Most people end up being confused or outright lost because new rules and regulations tend to crop up overnight leading people to being completely unsure to how handle tasks that they might have already been the ""correct "" way for weeks. Decent pay Management is bad Awesome company with a lot of growth potential WEB is an industry leader. It's tough for some to keep up with the pace of change sometimes, but there is no shortage of opportunity here. They promote a lot from within, so I've seen people start in front line roles and move into pretty high level leadership positions over time. Company really does care about and include employees Good training, management is involved with the employees so they do know what is going on outside their office doors. Concentration on coworkers dynamics so everyone is compatiable which makes a happier workplace. Play by their rules and you'll be fine. When I started with Webstaurant, it was unlike any place i'd worked before. it was exciting to see a place so invested in their employees. They make a great effort to find out what makes you tick as an individual. I really thought I had found my place. Many new employees start as merchandise packers. This is the most difficult position in the warehouse.You need to pack a target of 250 items (called lines) in a 10 hour period. Sounds easy right? Well many times there are multiples of certain items and you receive credit for one line. Example: 10/50 lbs. buckets of honey in the same order = 1 line. Items like these slow your productivity and strain your body. You can have several of the above examples during a shift and the goal never changes. This being said, if you can excel in this position, you can write your own ticket anywhere in the warehouse...as long as you are a cultural fit. Members of the management and lead positions are friends and/or have relationships outside of the workplace. Therefore, promotions and position movement happens often to the same people within a very short range of time. Other management slots may be filled from external postings with no experience working for Webstaurant causing more focus on productivity scores at the decline of the culture it has boasted for the past few years. There are four shifts available at our location. 1st shift 6:30 - 5:00 p.m./ 2nd shift 12:00 p.m. - 10:00 p.m./ 3rd shift: 7:00 a.m. - 5:30 a.m./ and a weekend shift. Most shifts boast a 4 day work week with one 20 minute break and one 30 minute lunch. Paid holidays, Four day work weeks, Good people, good pay, good benefits Attendance point system, very physical, difficulty meeting production/ quality goals fun place to work it was a great place to work it was my fault I was let go because of my attendance but I would recommend it to a friend. the staff and management are great people friendly and very helpful Great pay/people The people at Clarks webstaurant are awesome to work with, well the majority, and the pay and benefits are amazing. I stay busy which is great because it makes the time go by fast. We get breaks pretty much every 2hrs. All of my supervisors are really awesome and supportive. So far I love it there. They don't put up with nonsense and lazy people though. Which to me that is another plus side of it. If you want a job and are willing to come in and work, follow the rules then this is a great company. If you can't follow basic rules or like to slack you will not make it long. It is very physically demanding and a hard job but well worth the pay and benefits. Free drinks, pool tables, giant Jenga, corn hole, good people, great pay, great benefits, nice lunch area, Very safe, good management Very hard work, must be fast, lots of walking up and down stairs for breaks, hard to get in and out of building for start of shift and breaks, Some people love starting drama, 12hr shifts fast paced Very physical and fast paced workplace. Overall fun place to work.There are two very short breaks and one very short lunch. Everything is new every day. monthly perks very short breaks Don’t do it Absolutely the worst in terms of the culture- which they push as something they try to build with when employing new folks. That out the way, the work is very fast paced. If you are discouraged by being on your feet all day, this isn’t the place for you. If you do not intertwine yourself in the culture of gossip, this isn’t for you. However, if you can keep up with the pace, and don’t mind how loosely people speak to others, you’ll be fine. The 4 day stretch of days off at least from 4 shift Everything else Good place to work Just show up and do your job.respect people . a little crazy with new people but it's fast paced so the shift goes quick. Point system is whatever. Great pay and benefits consistent work Pay Point system N/a Free coffee and snacks. They want you to be glued to your computer to hit numbers. Stressful dealing with mad customers all day and can easily take it home with you. Great job Been here almost a year and love it your get up to 88cent raise every 6 months weekend shift tops out at 26.75 starts at 19.50 if you show up don’t call in and have a good work ethic you will move up Pay Non Generally good Generally good place to work but one has to ensure they do what is necessary to fit into the culture. Culture is king and if you don’t work within those boundaries it can be difficult. Horrible experience This place is all about fitting in. You can have a great work ethic, never be late and succeed at your position. If they do not like you which seems to be the majority of anyone over 30, they will tell you your not fitting in their culture. How this is legal and not considered discrimination is beyond me. I have never had issues with my personality and actually have always been very well liked at other jobs. 8 Thank you for taking the time to share about your experience. We do not condone any form of discrimination in any division of our company. Along with that, age is not something that we look at when we have applicants come in or when evaluating current employees. Your concerns have been shared with management for further review. Management nit picks and targets Places like this really need to review management skills because the people that run the show are the people actually working…. The management is overrun with children who have no idea how to treat people and will fire anyone who is an actual good worker for not being a culture fit Great people to work with Management 8 We work to train our management to provide their teams with both a safe and supportive environment. We encourage all employees to express their concerns and have constructive conversations with their managers. Your comments are concerning as we would not want any employee to feel that they are being treated unfairly. Your concerns have been shared with management for further review. Benefits and pay good The benefits are good but lacks training. The training is not set amount of time and was very short. Everyone trains differently and may need more than others. There should be a trainers for each department. Decent pay Managers are young early 20s and think they know everything and think they are better then everyone. Tried to apply to different functions was denied multiple times for bogus reasons. Cool place It's a nice place to work at with great employees and a pretty good management sometimes the standards can be set a little high but honestly not to bad. Great place to start your career Give credit to web, you have the opportunity to learn and grow as the company does, but they'll pay you like it. Best to take those skills once you get them and parlay that into a position at a company that will pay you Learning Compensation Hard work, Good Pay General good culture and very good pay. Could do a better job at hiring more qualified people to match up with the great starting pay. Too many people are hired that don't have the mindset, discipline or work ethic needed to meet the demands of the job. Informal and generally laid back environment. Company works hard to maintain a good culture. More transparency, recruiting better talent, equal accountability across the board. Worst management From district mgr down the worst, no experience, leadership, diversity or communication skills! Promoted by age, friendship, attraction, not ability! Pay is okay Management Fast paced work. If you can work in a high paced environment and handle a heavier workload you will thrive I have worked there for nearly 2 years and I have been impressed with the changes just in my time there. A good many people realize that they can't handle the pace but the expectations are not above normal capabilities. I have heard stories of negativity in the past but I feel times have changed at webstraunt. No compa y is perfect especially a still nearly new company.. I feel like leadership really does try to do their best not only for the company but for the emoyees. Paid vacation, nearly half a day for all shifts for employee solutions team to work on bettering the company, not only manditory OT but if someone wants or needs nore hours they are 75% of the time available, i could go on forever....... Alot of young people and different attitudes to deal with Overall good place to work Worked here for a little over 7 years. Management gets swapped out pretty frequently because upper management demands a lot of its managers. Pay was pretty good, not a lot of jobs starting out with that wage for someone with minimal to offer. Pretty fast paced. I wouldn't recommend working in the the grounds dept. Tons of drama and management is pretty bias and usually stands around by the computers talking and joking but destroy you if you stop and talk. no matter the reason. overall though, if you show up and do what they pay you to do you'll be happy. they pay good. After 7 years i had 4 weeks of pto and my 401k was at a reasonable number. My last manager was probably the better of all of them. she took interest in teaching me new things, and even was pretty patient with teaching me something i didn't get a full handle on instantly. The break room has a soda machine and they always do employee appreciation stuff. Decent Benefits Mandatory OT upset work life balance. Good pay, stressful environment Management doesn't care about you as an individual. You're a body and they're more than willing to replace you. Health insurance is expensive. Pay is good. The jobs pretty straight forward. Set schedule with mandated overtime during busy season. Fills you full of hope to rip it away Managers are immature and play favorites. Warehouse is falling apart and when you complain or speak up you are belittled and told its a job to get over it. Please keep looking for other jobs Great Job itself just schedule is rough on the home life. I would suggest this job to anyone. It is a great environment with great people. Personally, the scheduling sucks for me. The mandatory OT and the terrible time selections for shifts makes home life very hard. Great people, great job tasks Work life balance, job security Fast paced and friendly work environment Bloomsburg PA's distribution center has been open for a year now, it is so large and yet still has that brand-new clean feeling. The warehouse is almost fully staffed - keep in mind lots of new faces everyday, with plenty of friends to meet, or more hands to help you lift a box! It is great working here because the dress code is casual (jeans, sneakers, and a t-shirt). Plus, the snack racks in the break room are convenient when I forget my lunch. I find the days really fly by when i'm out on the floor driving a lift. Every job is different - Webstaurant has options and if you are unhappy in your position then let management know you want crossed trained to find your niche! For the quality of benefits (don't forget the company celebrations; you'll have to get used to being rewarded for your work), the pay scale (including bi-annual raises), and all the great people working here, it really makes it a team environment. Therefor it is challenging for many local workplaces to compete with the accepting environment Webstaurant has to offer. Company celebrations, good pay, nice benefits, clean work environment Indoors - if you have to work outside, this workplace may not be fit for you Bad culture There is a lot of favoritism if your an employee who can push high numbers, those people can get away with a lot. While others are reprimanded for their work or even fired. New people get treated like they are in boot camp from the QAs and veterans, they have to watch their backs while veterans can get away with things the new hires can't. It sort of feels like being bullied in high school. I dont think higher up management has the slightest clue what goes on and most people are scared to say anything because they dont know who to trust when it comes to certain people. The culture drastically needs some improvement from the bottom to the top. Free lunches, the money. Bad culture The Culture Honestly, when I first got hired I thought it was too good to be true. Covid derailed my career, so I had bounced from job to job trying to find a place that I felt was a good fit for my skills. But after months of working here, I can say that I don't have any intentions on leaving. I will say that in order to be a good fit for this company, you have to work hard. There is no slacking off here. So if you have a good work ethic, and like to be around awesome people, come on down and apply. Pay, benefits Managers are a joke. If you don't kiss up then you will be fired after a year or two. The turnover rate is high because they don't want you to make it to salary pay, so if you are close to 5 years be very careful. The money Everything else They work people like machines. Supervisors are not involved in production. Everything that goes wrong is your fault, no exception. It's a good place to get fired from. They will let you go before you reach the max pay rate, because it's cheaper to replace an experienced worker than it is to increase their pay. Steady work with maditory overtime yearly. Its Websteraunt. Great place to work with great pay and benefits. The pay is above average, the benefits are great, 401k match is decent. The people are wonderful to work with. Just do your work and don't create drama. They encourage you to think outside the box and ask for ideas. Doesn't always mean it will happen but it's nice they listen. It's a relatively new facility so it will take some to adjust. I think in time it will be an even better workplace environment. Free lunches, great pay, family oriented within reason, bad weather accommodating Sometimes mandatory overtime Great place to work I loved working here the environment was enjoyable and the work was consistent. Only down side is the long hours. Company overall though is very understanding and easy to work with Amazing work environment Long hours Generally good Generally good place to work but one has to ensure they do what is necessary to fit into the culture. Culture is king and if you don’t work within those boundaries it can be difficult. Trick to get you in the door They make the company sound great and through training they make you think training is solely for learning but if you don’t get it perfect they release you after training. Work life balance 6 Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. Training is designed to help you learn more about the company and our values. One of our core values is ""doing the right thing"" and we expect that across the board with all employees. Your concerns have been shared with management for further review. Repetitive but predictable It’s been an interesting journey, work is fine and easy to predict but management is pretty unpredictable and very clicky. There is no HR which is a little scary for big situations too Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback and we are glad to hear that you had an overall positive experience while working with us. Our management is trained to provide effective problem solving and support for their teams. The new Webstaurant is TOXIC When I first started, it was literally the best job ever. Great workout, fast paced job with the best peers as coworkers. And management was phenomenal! Truly cared for their workers. However, after I was promoted, management changed and the new managers and lead are TOXIC. Constantly put me down day after day, I was overworking myself to prove to them that I still belonged there. They belittled me, embarrassed me, and yet I still came to work everyday with a smile on my face ready to get work done. I was the only QA for about four months. I was doing both QA positions while also doing lead stuff due to only having one lead during that period. THREE positions and they tell me I'm not what the company needs? I didn't have to step up to the extra responsibilities, especially without extra pay, but I did. My receivers needed me and I wasn't going to let my team down. They're always putting down the receivers. They never help. They simply don't care. Toxic work environment and I would never suggest anyone to work there UNTIL they get an entirely new management team. Great Coworkers, Good Workout, Awesome Work and Learning Experiences Management Sweet gig Good pay for good work. Warehouse is temperature controlled which is very nice. People are pretty cool. I enjoy coming to work. The managers are respectful. One of the highest paying warehouses around, it’s a really good place to work. Sometimes free lunch Good work, bad people The work there is great. Much to do to keep you busy, however some of the managers there only care about what’s going on in people's personal lives and not what their job is at work. For some reason, the upper management preaches culture, and yet fires people based off rumors they hear without even giving people chances to defend themselves or present evidence against them. Would have been an awesome place to work and advance, but they seriously need to clear house and remove most of the managers and replace them with people who actually care about their employees. Busy work fair wages great benefits Poor management Fun, Fast-Paced, Friendly Great culture, benefits, training, and work life balance! High workload, but it makes the days go by quickly. Working from home is convenient too! I love the positive energy everyone has! Benefits, Culture, Advancement opportunities Work is like a cult Management pushes you to do more and more for the same pay. More experience but same pay. Job is not worth the time. If you make it passed 60 days, you won't make it passed 5 years. After you max out on your pay they fire you and hire someone else for less pay it's ok. It's not bad if you just need your first job, or if you're just looking for a way to eat. Beyond that it's not anything particularly special. There isn't much in the way of advancement or career growth, and the management, while not the worst I've experienced, doesn't seem to have your best interest in mind. Planning seems to be nonexistent. In short if you have no other option, sure, take it. If you do have options, I would advise looking elsewhere. Relaxed work environment No career growth Great place, Great People Throughout my time with WebstaurantStore I have had the opportunity to learn and grow as a person and as a professional. The individuals that I have the pleasure of working with throughout my day are encouraging, empathetic, and simply amazing. Couldn't ask for a better role. Culture, Benefits, Work-Life Balance Manager Experience If you're looking for and easy job this likely isn't for you. Upper Management creates a rigorous, metric-focused work environment and new managers are expected to immediately hold their team to the same standard. The 4-6 month Manager training program teaches you the hard and soft skills necessary to step into a leadership role. A huge emphasis is placed on company culture. Everyone from the director of operations to the janitor is expected to be a ""great employee."" Where most employees and managers fail is in the ability to give and receive feedback freely, adapt to the company culture, and deal with ambiguity of responsibilities. Successful managers/ employees hold their direct reports, peers, and managers accountable, can communicate clearly (with a high level of EQ), take ownership of their responsibilities, and think creatively. Warehouse department managers are responsible for teams as small as 3 or 4 employees, or as many as 50+ (depends on the department and warehouse size). Culture at any time can be slightly different from building to building, but the core values remain the same. Much of my time is spent working with assistant managers and team leads; making sure they're growing professionally and doing the right thing day to day. As long as my team is at or above expectation and I have reports, evaluations, and projects done on time I am free to manage my team how I think is best. Upper managers tend to not micromanage as long as work is being done well. Excellent manager development course, opportunities for growth, company ""swag"", generous profit sharing/ 401K match First year on health insurance is expensive, Unknown amount of time committed to working off shift hours, Can get very hot during the summer. Good values I enjoyed my time at the Web. They had strong values and a good belief system. I felt that they were fair and wanted to proved a safe work environment for everyone. If there were more opportunities, I would have stayed. I would return if I see an opportunity. Positive work environment Limited growth paths Qish I didn't have to leave. Would love to try and work for them in the future Always a great day when you get to work for such a fun and energetic group. An amazing understanding for real life issues and willing to work around employees faults to be able to allow the employee to succeed in the areas they are great at. Trying to hard You will not be treated like an adult. The majority of the company is hired straight out of college and your managers will be young with little life/work experience. Do not expect any legitimate support or advice from your manager. There is no HR department as the company expects everyone to be best friends. I would only recommend this company to someone straight out of college looking to build their resume and be compensated decently well for the job responsibilities. Remote work options, work/life balance. Inexperienced managers, job redundancy, no HR department. Terrible management The company says one thing and does another, they say they care about you when they really could care less. their culture fit program is a load of garbage. If you don't fit in or have a voice might as well leave because you will get fired over it A very hostile workplace Very poor management. And rude they don't care about you . While working there people contracted covid the company, never shut down for 24hrs to clean. Did not even want to follow the guidelines. Very toxic environment.for a workplace. And as far as brakes. I was told that that they didn't have to give me one. Just don't Petty management, no room for improvement, zero understanding on life situations. They expect you to be a machine and treat you as such. You're better off working somewhere else. Plays favorites If your not a favorite they will fire you over ANYTHING they will fire you because one of the favorites dont like you. You will get fried over not be scalable amd you will get fired for being to sociable. Your numbers can look good and your work performance can be out standing and if a favorite doesn't like you you will get fired You'll have a hard time finding a better employer My work is challenging, and the pace is relentless. This means I stay busy and focused, and the time passes quickly. The company cares about the employees, and there are a lot of opportunities for advancement. Good benefits, growing company Busy workplace, constant changes Job security is terrible Terrible management Growth only come to those that have personal relationships with management. And you will get fired without notice. This company cares little about you as a person as long as you can work your good but if something personal in your life that puts you down for a little while than your out. Pretty good pay Very little growth opportunities Stressful place to work with little positive feedback. This is a very fast paced place to work with many stressful situations all day. Management plays favorites and is unfair or oblivious to the people actually doing their job correctly. Some people are known to goof off everyday and get away with it but other people get coached for pulling their phone out just to check the time. In my specific job I got little to 0 positive feedback though a year and a half of being in my position even though I came in and gave 100% effort everyday. Most team leads are are poorly trained and unprofessional and pawn off their duties on workers below them. Management says to follow the chain of command when issues arise but even with doing that they do not get resolved. There are many genuine, good people that work here but management and the teams leads not doing their job correctly makes thing much more difficult for these people. I've had many people go behind my back to management and lie about me not doing my job properly which has always just been untrue. The company itself is a great place to work and you can tell they care about their workers but this wave of management did not cut it for me. They will soon swap the managers again soon which will then again cause issues. Breakroom with free soda Unfair treatment, Poorly trained team leads"
Tech Mahindra|" Disconnected, benefits mediocre High turnaround, large attrition, have had to fight to prevent performance firing for newer team members. Would not recommend - just another contract company willing to burn and churn. Productive and very interesting place to work. When I begin working at TechMahindra I learn so much about technology and the industry. Management always made sure you understood you job and your roll in what you are supposed to be doing. The workplace culture is one that is respectful of all cultures. The most enjoyable part of the job is when we begin training for new positions that can also be the hardest part of the job. Productive and fun Les connaissances approfondies de Tech Mahindra en matière d'ingénierie mécanique et électrique, son expérience des processus de vente et de service, et son exposition pratique à l'atelier de fabrication nous ont aidés à créer des offres numériques dans le domaine de l'activité principale. La fabrication chez Tech Mahindra est alignée sur la stratégie 3-4-3 de TechM, qui consiste à aligner 3 méga-tendances - 4 grands paris - pour atteindre 3 objectifs. Onsite Manager was great while upper management was cold The offsite managers did not care about the workers, was just about the money. they truly did not care about us the workers they only concerned with how much work they can get out of each indivual Onsite Manager Higher Up Management Good to be in Techmahindra Learnt so many things in Tech mahindra. However, based on my financial requirement, I am planning move out. Managemtn is very helpful to learn new things and very cooperative. Generally great I really liked the work and my team. They pay decently for the position, with good promotion potential relatively quickly. The only problem is that they fired me for a part of the client's security policy that no one had documented anywhere, nor had they covered in training. I understand that security is important, but it should also be clearly stated what is and isn't allowed. associate no hardest part of job . easy going and good work culture and fridays are the enjoyable part of job. many projects can jump between projects easily if there are requirements Only as good as your project If you have a good project that aligns with your personal goals, it may work for you. As a new graduate, we did not have any flexibility choosing the project or location. However, wlb is good. Productive and fun workplace No complaints. They are very helpful and attentive to employee needs. Good management team and always ready to assist you. Always check your email for meetings. Good people Nothing bad to say Learn and Grow Ive had the opportunity to learn so much as I find my gooting with this company. Sometimes remote work can be challenging , but I've found that current technology enables us to have opportunities to learn. Good Good company to work . New tech to learn. Insurance provided. Work from home is given. Onsite opportunity. Colleagues were friendly. And learned a lot in here Bad Management Only numbers are counted not the quality of the work. They micromanage constantly. I’ve seen 2 year olds with more freedom. They put a ban on taking PTO and constantly expect salary employees to work weekends. They do not care about the employees. I do not recommend this place. 0/10 Good place to work Good work life balance But no new technologies Depends on projects and team More onsite opportunities Work from home opportunity available. Varible parts comes with each and every month. Support Little internal support or team focus to achieve corporate goal. Frequent issue of goals without compilation required for complete understanding of time frame and competition. Wide selection of solutions Weak remote support Productive workplace Nice company to work for and very disorganized. Management needs to improve. Pay is pretty good. Work hard and continue to be productive. Good people ! Average place Good salary however it was always b2b and sometimes there was lack of supervisor support they were very strict with the schedule they definitely have to give you more time for lunch or break Excellent company Working with the latest technologies in IT. Great opportunity to learn if you are fresh out of college. Colleagues are very helpful. Good working environment. Management is good too. Call center like It was 100% remote at the start due to Covid, but then slowly bringing people back to the office. It's alot of applications and devices that we support for BJC Healthcare, so when you think you know must, you get something completely different. Training is good, but doesn't cover everything. Good work Culture Good work culture, but compensation can be better. Excellent work-life balance and very supportive colleagues. At times very conventional in approach Encouraging people and help you with anything I usually have to wait till I get assigned something to do. The job is straightforward and it can be time-consuming which I don't mind. Everyone is nice Get to work remote It's a part time job so not set hours great place to settled down Great place to work, good if you wanna grow up intoa company and you have plenty of experience and focus very competitive but as always yo can get promoted with proper numbers and also a good attitude of course Disconnected, benefits mediocre High turnaround, large attrition, have had to fight to prevent performance firing for newer team members. Would not recommend - just another contract company willing to burn and churn. Except compensation rest all fine Except compensation rest all fine Activities good. Enjoy good Fun food. Environment sweet Culture good Awesome office Rewards good Family gathering good at events Activities Compensation 1 Don't work here No one gives you a clear answer on what's going on. It's difficult to talk with managers cause they don't answer for days on end. It took a while to even start doing my job. 4 Low salary high work pressure Low salary high work pressure pressure Not satisfied working here no motivation not recommended work life balance is not good looking for change hope it help others No pros Only cons Good company Good company to work for. New laptops for employees Remote work. Good work/life balance Some there systems are a little inefficient compared to U.S. companies which I kind of understand since it's a huge organization. Overall good company On time salary. No work life balance. Teams with poor technical skills. Body shopping kind of work. No innovation. No salary hikes for existing employees. Leads needs to handle all the pressure as the members of the team are not competent enough to work. Ontime salary Work life balance EBIDTA Vs Employee Joined client location directly, the work and project from client end is good. But, dealing with TechM policies, HR, immigration and Management is a pain. Lack of transparency and clear hierarchy keeps you wonder who should you consult for things to move. Everything is employee's responsibility to take care. starting from understanding the job role at client location to creating a new project and persuading the offshore team to give their consent for feasibility. Everyone works with only thing is mind, whether it gives me billing or project. The most disappointing aspect is from HRs, I had a concern to discuss on my salary appraisal, the HR added my manager without even intimating me in the call. Finally I had to leave when I requested a salary raise, they tried to replace because EBIDTA doesn't match company requirements, even though I had new project in pipeline that will create revenue. Typical Indian bureaucracy, lying is common tool by employed by managers. Challenging client projects Management Fun place Fun place to work. Growth is not good. Appraisals is a joke. Managers can be tough at times. Fast paced environment. Very good for beginners and enter level associates. Not a very stable or secure place to work - constant layoffs - low hours - no time off - no benefits - extreme job instability, even macdonalds have more job security than this. - unpaid time off, you pay for your own flights to get to job location - extreme secrecy with the job , wont tell you anything . they expect a drone that will do the job without questions - if they can hire you for free they will. - they expect you to kiss a** since you work for the “client”. the client is a major douch*** low hours so youll have plenty of time not working and not getting paid you wont have a job for more than 5 months Trash The company is trash. It’s no room for growth at all. Stay away from it if you can, you will be doing yourself a big favor. You’re basically just a number Good Training and Learning opportunities but poor advancement and raise opportunities Not a bad company if you want comfortable routine and relatively good job security for a company that works on a contract services base. But do not expect meaningful pay or career advancement. Hours are good, my direct report is fantastic, good health benefits and lots of available upskilling opportunities below average pay, uncommunicative HR, disorganized upper management, few opportunities for advancement or pay raises. Not bad to work for, but can treat contractors better. Had a very rocky start, with loads of onboarding and pay problems for multiple employees, because they decided to use several payroll companies with little experience, for a big project. After about 2 months, things started coming together, but the horrendous start left a bad taste in many people's mouths. This is best place for beginners! but, not for long! Work-life balance conflicts. Won't pay as per location standard (N minus 30%) but pay more for the local hires. will need to have tough time dealing with the HR/Payroll department. (frustrating) depends on project, things will get decided. low salary, No GC filing! mostly the reason why employees leave.... Culture and language barriers Due to the culture and language barriers, it is often hard to complete assignments. They assign mandatory training assignments that have nothing to do with your position and are often spoken in bad English which makes it hard to understand. Good place to work Good place to work. I joined here as an associate and gone through different phases. I was dedicated to my work, applied for an IJP and succeeded to get to a Team leader role. Buenas prestaciones No es un trabajo seguro ya que de un día a otro te avisan que te sacan de la campaña sin dar motivos exactos ni derecho a réplica. Seguro médico privado, me lo dieron casi después de un año. No hay buena retroalimentacion de calidad. Difficult management but there is some flexibility on the work schedule The daily tasks weren't too difficult, but there is not much room to grow and learn. Sufficient training is not typically provided before the job, and the management made it always extremely difficult to raise complaints or ask to accommodate workers' needs. They valued family events and personal reasons to take some time off, so the work time was quite flexible. Run as fast as you can because they have the worst management ive seen so far. The las vegas site is currently run by site leads who has no experience in management industry so most of time they seem lost. If you are someone who has bills to pay then this job is not for you. your lucky if you even work 40 hours a week on this job. but if you are someone who don't mind working only 20 to 30 hours a week then this job is for you. but beware because alot of employees here were having alot of issues with their paycheck not getting paid on time or sometimes they wont be even pay at all with all the missing hours. None management, less hours of work really blessed to work here really blessed to work here, managers are very muxh friendly and there are constant recognision and awards, appraisal is an issue, but if you have good connections it will be great Lack of projects for testers I was working for a client during pandemic and the client work was really frustating.Pay given us also less.i would recommend to join a product based company Dont work for a Indian company Awful job and couldn't stand working for them and the training was trash and I would never recommend this company to anyone nor trust them i can't believe they are still a company None Everything Disconnected, benefits mediocre High turnaround, large attrition, have had to fight to prevent performance firing for newer team members. Would not recommend - just another contract company willing to burn and churn. Pass on by this company Poor management and lack of compassion and care for employees. Poor pay scale and expensove benefits. Hard to raise a family or even be a single parent on the wage offered. Heavy workload. Not many All 5 Great People Confusing Support I loved the people I worked with. They were engaging and professional. The frustrating part is working through all the web sites for HR or IT questions or support. The company is so large its hard to navigate where to go to get computer sign on or issue resolution help. A lot of opportunities Your on your own to figure out how to navigate the web of sites for help. 1 1 great eplace to work awesome place to work, loved working with everyone here, very great environment. the work was well cut out and the management was caring and presented their expectations clearly. Frustrating New Hire On Boarding I started with Tech Mahindra in April 2021 and my salary was good, my manager was great but the support for system set up, passwords, HR issues and timesheets was pretty frustrating. Vague instructions and very little person to person communication to resolve issues. Good Work LIfe Balance for Day to Day work Not enough PTO time and frustrating help desk and HR Help. Exciting workplace and new things to learn For someone who graduates from electrical engineering and are ready to stay in that sector amidst this IT dominated job market in US, this is a great place to start. Stressful Job- Over burden Manager supports and backs, But the Work schedule with the Client is stressful.Very hard to manage multiple projects at a time.In the process of this you will loose your family life and personal life. They need to Hire enough resources for the amount of work to make Customer/Client Happy The benefits- health insurance is good. Good Team, Management backs. Stressful, over load with work, Can’t manage the Work life balance. Avoid Provisioning takes weeks, unable to perform job duties after being there a month due to lack of security. Language barriers. Too many projects and no organization. Very high turn over. OVERWORKED! Steady pay check Too much work! Supportive team, good pay, no job security My department was very small, so might not reflect Tech Mahindra (TM) as a whole. But in my experience it was a good place to work. Pay was good, insurance was cheap (less than $$40/month for 80/20 medical, dental, and vision). My manager really had our backs, and was always there to support us. Our department relied on contracts so every year or two there was always a concern as to if we would have a job next year. Eventually my department was closed due to not getting the contract renewed. When TM initially absorbed my previous company, they cut out a lot of vacation time, but in my department that wasn't really an issue as time was extremely flexible. cheap insurance, good pay, supportive manager no long term job security very bad in terms of job security and tech stack Not a job company for long term just a pitstop company. No relocations , No project rotations , Job security is a rare thing , tech stacks are not latest as per market ,compensation is also not par and hikes are also less good campus with swimming pools and gyms no job security, old technologies, very bad HR management. Long story short - don't join this company Response time from HR after putting resignation ..oh ! wait that from 3-4 four days before my last working day (This response time showed me how valuable I was to the company ) . They give money on time (the irony is that we have to write this as an advantage , which is the least we can expect from any company ) . They have great incentive programs , if you have the capability of crossing the carefully knit web especially made so that if you work your a**off then only you can earn A ton of things . From the day I got recruited to the day I left , never-ending problem . They don't care about employees , they don't care what suggestion you are giving , what problem you are telling , same as most of the corporate offices . Pretending to listen to employees by creating some meetings and all the suggestions you give goes to gutter . It's like ""yeah we hear you and please don't speak next time because we are not listening "" . If you keep you head down , don't speak anything for all the wrong that is happening , work your a** off (and i mean literally , for example, incentives are kept for additional money making , now hypothetically speaking if an employee wants to work only for his CTC , then be prepared to be hunted by TL for worst performance . ) then this company is for you because hey it's an MNC !!!!! ok pay tons of Good company The company offers good opportunities, good management. Flexibility. Understanding, opportunities of equality for different races. Work as a team, good balance of work. Nice environment None ok Good service company to get experience various domains and technologies. onsite opportunities available. overall its good and benefits are ok. medical plan is expensive if you have family Great place for learning new edge technology Good place to work. Great place for learning new edge technology. Promotion/Hike never meets your expectation which demotivate you always. They don't care about increasing salary for existing employee rather they will hire outside. Great learning opportunity Nothing Just work work work. Stressful and not much help. Slow days 10 calls and upto 40+ calls a day on week days specially Mondays and Tuesdays, compensation is below market. good for first timers who want to learn and get into desktop support and learn basic IT. Not a bad place to work Not really a bad place to work. You get a sense of job security, except no room for advancement. There is a lot of micro management. No clear path of direction and the pay is poor. Better look at a different job than working for techm Worst management group. They treat employees like body shopper. This is a body shop company. No good benefits, no job security. As soon as client contracts ends, even for employees they suddenly issue 2 week notice and then try to place in another position or another client. None Bad management, bad benefits, no sense of inclusiveness, body shop company Great Company Good consulting company.. lot of opportunity to grow, mediocore pay, onsite opportunities are good... Technology focused, people and team is good. leadership miss longterm vision and struggle to keepup with the momentum of IT going thru Zero growth ""No Self Rise"" Typical service based firm where client is god. Most of the projects are maintenance and support of legacy code . No learning env. Some times it took 2 years for 1 single appraisal cycle .that too without salary hike. Worst part was the management/managers. health care plan Management, Old technology stack, no growth, no pay hike, zero support from anyone, non existing HR Complete nightmare Management doesnt know how to do their jobs, fellow employees are out for themselves and are rewarded for it. No direction or purpose. Instead of helping you succeed, they will fire you I dont work there anymore Mismanagement, no clear direction, lack of communication, underpaid Not the best company to start a career It really depends on the kind of team we are in, but in general, the company is not employee friendly. They would never bother about its employees, instead they only focus on clients appreciation without bothering whether the amount of burden that client puts on the employees is fair or not. average salary bad management Disconnected, benefits mediocre High turnaround, large attrition, have had to fight to prevent performance firing for newer team members. Would not recommend - just another contract company willing to burn and churn. Avoid Pay and benefits are not good. It flet like the company is trying to take advantage of their employees. I worked there for 3 years never got a raise. 1 work culture a typical day at work: Good what you learned : Technology management : Very good workplace culture: Good the hardest part of the job : Nothing the most enjoyable part of the job: Colleagues and supporting staff. work culture Compensation 1 2 Always waiting for the Axe to fall and your job to go to India Very stressful for onshore associates. You are expected to carry the workload for offshore teams who are hired straight from college with no real world experience. No work life balance in IT as you are expected to always be reachable. If someone off shore does learn your job well you can expect to be let go and that person will take over your job. It’s a job No 401k match. Only 2 weeks vacation. NO JOB SECURITY Decent company It depends on whether you are at the right place at the right time. I have seen this company work out for some people and not work out for others. There are lot of opportunities, it depends on our ability to grab them. Work life balance, good benefits Ridiculously low salaries, middle level management is not empowered to do anything. Unprofessional Management see you as disposable Management and HR are unprofessional and incompetent. They don't care and will just replace you if you question them. HR will plainly lie to your face and then deny a conversation even took place. They try to force out if contract working hours and just sack any one who questions it. Don't make any trouble if you are still in probation! Cute IT guy Inappropriate demands on staff, unsafe work environment. Bullying and harrassment Good work projects, less pay OVerall good work environment with decent work life balance which majorly depends on the client you are working with. The pay offered is less than market standards. Pay is weird, HR is a joke Pay is weird. They hire you as salary, but pay hourly. Any holiday/OT pay is supposed to be paid out 2 pay periods later, but more often than not, it's a battle with HR to try to get it paid out, and then sometimes, if they feel you weren't there (i.e clocked in, but having system issues) they will charge you on a future paycheck what they call ""salary arrears"" that they say is time/money you owe the company for not working while you're clocked in. Unethical management, no morals , mostly a lousy bodyshopping setup There are no proper HR policies. Management doest have ethics. doesnt believe in honoring commitments, Company doesnt have any major product or solution to offer. mostly a body shopping setup Decent compensation Just a body shop.no products, solutions or for that matter ethics not bad for beginner, mostly based on client project most of the projects are at client location only stress depends on client project but not much help from management over all good place to start and learn flexibility no 401k match, limited time off OK type Company, Low salary Management's top concern is to save money but employee doesnt get it. Work life balance is OK. On offshore favoritism exists a lot. Appreciation doesnt happens even though you might work a lot. Work time flexibility, Insurance low salary, bad management Good Company Good Company to work and they have good opportunities. Managers are always very supportive. Good supporting managers salary Good working environment The good point is you can have working flexibility. The cutting down the employee perspective benefits year by year. if you failed in any issue and reached to HR then don't expect that your problem will get resolved. I raised major concern 2 times but no use. Productive and fun work place We are constrantly improving and love to work with organization .Very good team with knowledge sharing and caring . Happy to be part of organizationm free lunch short break Outsourcing deal brought me into TM The original company I worked for outsourced their IT department to Tech Mahindra, and my job came over to TM with that deal. So I didn’t interview. Tech M is a horrible company. I’ve worked here for over a year. No 401k match, poor culture on the ground. Their image states they have good work life balance but they hire management that wants you to do everything at all costs to make the customer happy, it doesn’t matter how it impacts you personally. I am in management myself, as well. It’s hard for me to work with peers who are only concerned about how to extract more money from their clients. They also pay US employees poorly because they can get 2-3x people in India at the same price. Remote work Corporate offshore culture Company was a mess. Company had no idea what they were doing and had a 80% turnover rate. Training was lack luster and leadership was worse. No help was given to new people and everyone wanted to do whatever they wanted. None Everything you can imagine Fun at work, good team members Work wise it is good and depends on the Project and manager, .. only drawback is no flexibility of timings. Lack of Assistance and Training as well as Over the Top Expectations from Different Culture Typical day consists of signing into work around 08:00 CST and begin reviewing your case backlog in Salesforce. Following up with customers and to ensure that they get the customer services and expertise that they deserved. We each get an hour lunch break each weekday to ensure that we have time off to do errands. Benefits are ok, but there are no matches for 401K. Healthcare benefit is ok, but be prepare to pay copays as well. Benefits, paid on time, good peers, and work area is ok, it's mediocre. Training issues, too much pressure from top to bottom, and Typical MNC good place to learn as they do have world class training programs and a typical service based company where work life balance is lacking..Management should listen to employeees about their compensation /hike issues trainings, team work, supportive management compensation, work life balace great have been working at Microsoft full-time for more than a year Pros Excellent benefits, great support from leadership, mentorship, culture, smart people Cons Promotion timing and how they choose employees for promotion is completely unknown. Too much credit to talkers not actual performers. If you want to get a promotion, you have to be a talker and known Advice to Management Give credit to the actual performers. Minimize leadership/Org changes. Too many changes in a short period of time :( Productive and fun place to work a typical day at work: working for client, presales work of their products and services what you learned: communication with CXO level clients management: tricky, bureucratic lobby workplace culture: professional the hardest part of the job: to keep everyone happy and/or motivated the most enjoyable part of the job: praise from the clients good salary in hand long hours Disconnected, benefits mediocre High turnaround, large attrition, have had to fight to prevent performance firing for newer team members. Would not recommend - just another contract company willing to burn and churn. It's good company to work Tech mahindra is good company to work .time salary and lot benefits for employees .good working culture .growth learning is good .upskilling Good Need to improve salary part 1 No work life and people were dishonest Poor leadership and poor management. The other reviews have said enough already. Management likes to pick specific employees who are their favorites and they like to pick their least favorites as well. 1 Outsourced We were taken over from Jackson National. There were about 200 of us that were pushed over to TechM. They told us that our jobs were safe but that is not the truth. By the end of this year 75% of us will be gone. Most of our positions will be done from India. Their pay is above average but you may not be employed very long. Their benefits are ok. Health insurance is by far subpar. If you have the ability, I would look elsewhere but if you dont mind moving every 18 months, this maybe for you. Pay No job security. Total lack of direction. Management pulling from opposite directions. Lack of direction. hired to do something that was totally different than what I ended up doing. I was to create and lead a team of Architects to work with clients on the GE team and instead I ended up working on opening and closing work orders from another team. Flexible time and remote work. no help from resources Not so productive but feels happy to work here Overall great place to work but not worthy to the efforts you put in when you join there as a fresher and stay long working with them. The compensation are not that great. Less work pressure Bad hikes and compensation Very good company Work-life balance It's very good company you're worthless Overall Tech Mahindra is a very good company to work for and would still be working there if they do not lose the contract with Aetna. Very good management and very good benefits. Excellent Experience Excellent team members Apt direction from management Fun place to work Growth with learning Freedom of expression Opportunities extended from the company An abusive relationship Working at TechM was like being stuck in an abusive relationship and not being able to get out due to the financial factors. Constantly dealt with paycheck errors with simple arithmetic for my hourly wage and overtime. Emails and requests to resolve the issue always seemed to fall on deaf ears with HR. For a company that gets paid to take jobs from American workers and put them in the hands of India you would think they could handle themselves with a little more integrity. But no...communicating with HR and management was an absolute joke. This was a problem for dozens of people that got pushed into an outsourcing plan like sheep to the slaughter.... Good benefits Hr, Poor Communications, Horribly negligent management Good Workplace for Onsite opportunities and work life balance. Work-life balance Work-life balance at Tech Mahindra is pretty good. You're never overloaded with work. Pay & benefits My pay and benefits at Tech Mahindra are moderate. Job security and advancement In terms of job security at Tech Mahindra, I think it is a good company to work with. Management In general, managers at Tech Mahindra are average and personal development opportunities are limited. Culture Collaboration with my colleagues at Tech Mahindra is average. Generally, the employee satisfaction level is higher in India than at onsite. Overall My experience working at Tech Mahindra is good. GIS operator Took them forever to straighten out pay issues which means I was not paid for the first month until two months later. The HR rep was clueless and they kept asking for repeated copies of everything but the NDA. Had to do the drug test on a day off while traveling on the road. At least I did not have to share a room. Some hotels were literally roach motels while some were great. One person per room HR nightmare. Gr8 Company to work with Provides lots of oppty to grow within the organization if you show the zeal for it. Provides lots of trainings that helps employees keep up to date with the latest technologies. Gr8 workplace culture. Productive and good learning place Learned new things in every project which I worked. Overall it was good experience to work in an active environment and had good opportunities during my tenure. Tech Mahindra ● Overall The company has good management and the overall experience was nice. It helped me focus on what's important and where I can get better to make my skills stronger and better. Just to unlock reviews The only reason I'm writing this is to check out some reviews of other companies, tech Mahindra is an Indian company that works their employees to the bone Do not work here It’s a very bad company to work in. You will face discriminations , dirty politics if you are not a South Indian. Your hard work has no value and no raises in this company. Also it’s a manager driven company where manager will not even search for a project when you get released from 1 project. They will force you to resign. Just one- mobile and data bill reimbursement Racial discrimination, no raises in salary and career, manager driven, no projects in US Productive and platform for new learning with opportunities Nice working with Tech Mahindra. Provided platform to learn to test vigorously using many tools like Load Runner, JMeter, and also performance engineering concepts and tuning using Dynatrace and other tools. Management helped me always in my career growth and in learning experiences. Don't work here Little or no training. Pay checks were weeks late. Pulse project was a joke. No support. Management was non-existent. Cramped phone room sweatshop. Be prepared to be let go with no warning or reason. That is your ""Right to work"" in North Dakota. Got to work at home during the pandemic Everything Low Pay and Poor Treatment The pay for level one support is lower than I have seen in the past 15 years. Your experience and knowledge will not matter to the middle managers who treat the schedule and the IT Associates by there personal whims and favorites. better than starving or being homeless low pay, poor benefits Employee Friendly Good work environment.Learning and job rotation policy.Management is nice for career progression.Remote work flexibility.Diversity and inclusion.Many digital telecom projects fast paced call center tech support situation you will spend 8 hours on the phone(unless U get night shift) most of managers are cool. They invest in training U some of the job. Most of the job is reading knowledge base articles to solve customer issues... that can be challenging.. most of co workers are supportive"
City of Pittsburgh|" Fun to start but the stress wore me out. I had an enjoyable career in Pittsburgh. As a police officer your always dealing with other people’s problems. So, you learn to solve problems between family members and neighborhood disputes. I wears on you after a period of time. All of my bosses were great. As much overtime as you want Didn’t see family a great deal of the time 3 2 Not good benefits, but good direct supervisors I overall enjoyed my work here. Wouldn't want to stay here long term as the benefits package is subpar. I would hope for an improvement in the future, but don't count on it. Terrible Was forced out due to residency after 4 years I just feel as though they don't give two cares about their employees. Honestly the hardest part is going above and beyond for a company and then they terminate you. 1 1 Great place to work Great place to work. Plenty of opportunity for growth. Highly recommend. Great work schedule and work life balance. Enjoyable work community and great benefits. Great career place The City of Pittsburgh is a place you can ahave a career you get there and you can work to move up and retire from. The benefits are a great for families. Benefits are great Must live in city limits Horrible place to work Poor training, poor management, no motivation to work and do a good job. Management will reward poor workers by taking work off of them and penalize good workers by adding to their work load. The only way to advance is to ""know"" someone. Can't think of any Poor working enviroment Hectic internship The department was very understaffed and disorganized as a result. Staff was incredibly friendly and dedicated to their work, and always jumping between multiple projects in one day. Flexable with the schedule Great place to work. Fair and work with you when needing time off. Only problem was cost of living raise no merit raises. Enjoyed my time with the city. Willing to be flexible Pay was ok but no merit raises Neat and interesting job with occasional moments of danger Being a firefighter for the city of Pittsburgh was excellent at first. The excitement of actually being a public safety hero, and the entire experience of training school as well. Years later it was evident that there is major downtime. So be prepared for that, find ways to entertain yourself. Productive ways The reputation The downtime Good people to work with Get to do impactful work every day. Nice people to work with. Was stressful as an intern but would be better if in a full-time position. The department director was newer so might have improved government office work is standard office stuff, have decent equipment and good training lots of encouraging e mails and health related info given out. decent work hours for clericals generous time off pay is low good way to get to know the city Working as a public servant is a good way to get to know a city. I learned a lot about the area. Some coworkers were very motivated, others were not.. Job is goin downhill The job is goin downhill. Not enough employees/ men to handle the job as a whole. Mgmt seems to cant get it right niether. We have a union but our union is not really strong enough to deal with mgmt Get paid for 8 hrs regardless of what time you get done. Off on weekends Too many to name Simply sucks Don't waste your time. $15 an hour to put up with Bulls***. Has gotten worse over the year. And, expected to get more worse. Soon to be short staffed. Find another place. Trust me, this place isn't worth it. None Everything Long Time Ago I'm only filling this out to make the indeed notification go away. I haven't worked for the City in over ten years. Since then, a new mayor was elected who did not keep any of the managerial staff with whom I worked. I have no idea what it's like to presently work for the City. Look some place else Poor leadership, no good benefits low pay increases. Would not recommend the city of Pittsburgh to anyone looking for a police career. A lot of hard work for very little satisfaction. Nice Place and People • Created 6 KPIs to measure reporting hours, overtime rate and reporting fatigue; Decreased reporting time variations by 50% and saved the department $17,003 annually • Initiated Time Study and Reporting quality survey for both Policemen and Firefighters; Collected responses and analyzed to identify reporting wastes and largest variations; Created Tableau dashboards to present insights to stakeholders Great place to work Filled with people who love their job and want to contribute to the community. Very welcoming environment. I was only there for a short time but everyone was willing to work together to get the job done Nothing, it was law enforcement. No, I no longer work there. It changed every day. No two days were the same. I have nothing to add. If you watch tv, you can get an idea of what it is like to work. Pretty good Not a bad employer, other employees are somewhat territorial. Systematically, old school i processes. Experience solely based on department and supervisor structure. Best job ever enjoy working with the kids The enjoyable part of the job is safety of the children coming to school and getting home from school in a safely matter everyday and to see the smiles The experience working with the kids None Fun to start but the stress wore me out. I had an enjoyable career in Pittsburgh. As a police officer your always dealing with other people’s problems. So, you learn to solve problems between family members and neighborhood disputes. I wears on you after a period of time. All of my bosses were great. As much overtime as you want Didn’t see family a great deal of the time 3 2 Productive area If I wasn't working with graphic designing I was doing video editing, photo editing, recording, or photographing. The only down time was early in the day or during lunch Enjoyable place to work The City of Pittsburgh was an enjoyable place to work. I got to meet new people all the time. Experience the court system. Room for advancement and raises. 1 Parks department Maintain the parks landscape work worked on and maintained equipment. Worked on the trails throughout the park. And prepared for events in the park such as Marathon and so forth Good job magements sucks Good job magement needs to be more professional workers do wat they want and get away with it. Good workers gwt treated like bad workers. Other than that its a good laid back job. Great job The job is a great job the pay doesn’t fit my living expenses and my Desire to grow with the development of the city. I’m seeking a management position Loved it Completed a summer internship with the Department of Sustainability. We worked in a team of 5 women on a Bloomberg Mayor's Challenge grant. The team was very helpful and collaborative, as we moved towards an innovative solution for energy deduction in residential homes. Good! The city is a wonderful place to work for! They have very friendly people and wonderful catalog of job positions. They offer a wonderful benefit package as well! Terrific place to work the issues to troubleshoot are vast and a lot of fun A typical work day is troubleshooting computer and network problems or installing software. I learned a lot of SCCM installation procedures. The management was extremely talented, helpful and insightful. The hardest part of the job was learning things on my own with no training, however it was very intriguing and fun. The most enjoyable part of the job was troubleshooting and having a team with a vast amount of skills to help me grow and learn a set shift, benefits and great team No overtime great summer job this was a great summer job which allowed me to travel around the city and work with young adults. It was a great experience watching them develop as young men and women. Don't come to the city as a young person. I would not recommend this Job to a young person. Make your money on the outside first before coming to the city. Make your money on the outside first. Health insurance 1/2 of a pension to political Worst decision I made the WORST decision by starting this position! The pay is horrible. It’s the most toxic environment filled with bullying, nepotism and disrespect. I would never recommend working here to my worst enemy. Word of advice the benefits may look nice but it’s not worth the stress and anxiety you will endure. On top of the asbestos the place is a death trap. None None Ugh A Mess I was actually really excited to transition from my job where I was vested after 12 years of employment to venture to a new start and opportunity after receiving my Masters. BIG mistake! I would never recommend working for the city. The city county building is disgusting, they don’t clean, there’s never soap in the bathroom. I have constantly had a cold/cough since I started working in the dusty building. I wonder if the mayor actually walks around the building where his plush office is. Word of advice...don’t work here! You’ll regret it. None Everything Don't work here. Terrible pay and benefits. The city facilities are awful. Went a month at our location without toliet paper. That is not a joke. Filthy buildings. City does not provide medical to many people upon retirement. City will off set your pension with your social security if you rec any. Low morale. Everyone is looking for another job. Only bonus is unlimited overtime since everyone quits or calls off because they dislike it so much. unlimited OT too many too list Usually opportunity for advancement but limited for administrative roles Expectations of performance vary greatly depending on the direct supervisor. Pay is not usually commensurate with actual performance. Organization is experiencing growth in multiple areas, simultaneously, expanding some positions' responsibilities while other positions continue to perform minimally. Very generous benefits. Benefits Disparate Standards Great first job This is a great place to work to get your feet wet in the legal profession, especially if you are still exploring practice areas. However, there is just about zero room for advancement and the salaries are very low. Overall good place to work with glaring holes A Typical work day for me is putting out network, IT related fires. Not a lot of time for proactive troubleshooting. Upper management is lackluster at best, and due to their lack of technical knowledge, it is hard for them to grasp the scope of work. Upper management is appointed, where as everyone else is hired based on the proficiency of knowledge to their related field. Things get lost in translation. The culture is chaos, but being a troubleshooter at heart it leads to an interesting time for me. The most enjoyable part of the job is the ability to touch multiple platforms of technology. Benefits, flexible schedule, on cal rotation Lack of communication productive and helpful and nice people to work with. The duties that I performed were, collecting tax checks and knowing which taxes they were for, inputting the information for the checks into the correct spreadsheets, entering information for new employees, setting up parcel spreadsheets via porta spreadsheets, figuring out the tax value of certain parcels (city tax, state market or standard tax value), I was also asked to research the spending and usage of municipal bond money and I created a 2017 tax revenue spreadsheet to track quarterly tax payments. Throughout this internship, I have learned a lot, mostly about taxes and how they are spent, but also about the way our city uses them to create better infrastructure and improvements. I think the tax that sparked my interest most and really helped me learn about forecasting finance was the entertainment tax. That is one tax that really fluctuates and is difficult to predict. The city counts on their events to bring in revenue for the city. Some months they have many events while other times they have very few. In addition to taxes I also learned about municipal bonds, those bonds generate revenue for the city as well, however; if the government does not spend the money in time, they will be taxed twice as a penalty. One difficulty that I faced during the internship was the feeling of wasting my time. At the beginning of my internship, it was the start of the tax season. I was mostly in charge of data entry and that really started to make me feel as if this could potentially be the wrong choice for me. Thankfully, once the majority of the tax information was processed I was Seasonal Job as a Lifeguard I loved being a Lifeguard during my years working for the City of Pittsburgh. This was never intended to be a lifetime career. Great place to learn and develop crucial skills for your future endeavors. Work Outside Not enough work/life balance Relaxed atmosphere Typical day of work is working with youth. I learned how to teach various skills. Management was laid back. Workplace culture was a positive environment. The hardest part of the job was the paperwork. The most enjoyable part of the job was the appreciation from the kids. Being a positive influence to children No increase in salary Pittsburgh Not much to say, Pittsburgh is a great place to live if you have a good job. Lots of great educational options as well. It is a great place to raise a family. Fun to start but the stress wore me out. I had an enjoyable career in Pittsburgh. As a police officer your always dealing with other people’s problems. So, you learn to solve problems between family members and neighborhood disputes. I wears on you after a period of time. All of my bosses were great. As much overtime as you want Didn’t see family a great deal of the time 3 2 Not a place to have a career Hostile work environment. The city was not interested in having a professional recreation department. It was downsized considerably over the course of two years. 13 Great for experience only It's a great place to get free training and experience. The pay is way to low compared to other departments and the pension is so poor that it's honestly embarrassing. You can work as much and earn as much as you want. You are a number, when you die or are broken down and can't work, you are swept aside for the next body. 6 Collaborative, respectful environment Attorneys, Investigator, Legal Secretaries and Law Clerks all work very well together. Each individuals' opinion is respected and use to solve problems and explore new ideas and strategies. love working for the city work day was some times long got a chance to meet all kinds of people love the people that I worked with ,management was was just that keeping use on our toes over time vacantion times Great place to work Wonderful people and work environment. Ability for advancement is tangible. The benefits (health, dental, vision, life) are excellent! The Administrators are easy to talk to and kind. some of the chiefs and mayors were horrible enjoyed my fellow workers, enjoyed the daylight shift I had. The time spent away from family was tough,but, the compensation wasn't bad,but, you had to work 70- 80 hours a week. working for the city The City Of Pittsburgh Is agood place to start to get your feet in the door, its not to fast or slow its just right. Dealing with the community and public makes the job the best I enjoy my job All in all it is a good place to work. everyone works together to get the job done. As far as the work load ,some day are better than others. The work is hard but the pay is fair. work insentive the weather It's ok Working for the government is always stressful but the management isn't bad and the autonomy at work is a plus. Long hours and minimal time for a personal life Great! Great place to work with great benefits! Always a work/life balance, and management that is understanding to employees needs. Only con is the requirement to live in the city. Great experience Overall experience was great. The fact that the company has been a great place to work, I would go back there. A lot of walking, in which, gave exercise at not cost. Hours Smell City of Pittsburgh I have enjoyed my time with the City of Pittsburgh, especially the bureau of police. I have learned a lot about the PA and local justice systems in the last 3-4 years. The problem is that there is no room for advancement. Customer Service Processing permits from Utility workers, public, contractors, etc. I'm learning about property lines, addressing, and geographic. Management is precise and down to earth. Culture is diverse The job can get challenging with amount of permits being processed. The most enjoyable part of the day is making people smile. Safe job with ceiling I am by title a Network Analyst, but that translates to System Administrator. I also dual function as Scrum Master. My daily tasks include, but not limited to running backups, configuring switches and routers, creating vm's and maintaining them in VSphere, maintaining integrity of servers in virtual and physical environment. The benefits are great, and you get a ton of hands on experience especially in the IT department. The hardest part of the job is the lack of competitive pay, and lack of training because of pre-defined budget constraints. Freedom to work(Higher Tiered positions), hands-on experience, benefits limited training, not cross-functional, very clear ceiling, non-competitive wages Wonderful place to make a difference in the lives of the communities we serve. A typical day is fun and educational programming for youth and families. A flexible management is necessary to be successful at this position.My co-workers and staff have a friendly and welcoming attitude at all times. Working with children always has it's ups and downs, but our goal is to provide the best environment and experiences for our participants, young and old. Being able to be a positive influence in the lives of our members is the most enjoyable and fullfilling aspect of this position. It's a dismal place to work, morale has disspated greatly It's a government organization of which I'm not accustomed to. Coming from a corporate environment, I find that a lot is taken for granted. Customers (other employees) aren't valued the same as they are from a corporate perspective. Respect for fellow workers are a scarce commodity, especially when political favor happens to be how some folks got their job in the first place. good health care Working at I&P The Dept at the City of Pittsburgh Office of Innovation and Performance was a great learning experience for me. The daily work life at I&P was challenging, but also laid back. Deadlines need to be met, but there is room for creativity and self-expression which is nice. Business Casual, exciting environment No coffee Good Work/life balance, pay below average Good work life balance. Good paid time off/vacation time. Pay is below average and raises are rare besides cost of living increase. Overall a pretty good place to work. It is a pleasure working with the public, whether old or young. It has been a pleasure working with the public, I get to meet new people every day. I also enjoy working with public safety, keeping our children safe. My coworkers and I have the same goal in mind, to keep our children safe. The hard part of my job is fast moving traffic. The joy is seeing their smiles every morning. Enrichment education for low-income and at-risk youth This position offers direct engagement with challenged youth in direct community service and in after-school tutoring and counseling sessions. I also have worked directly with elderly citizens, conducting interviews and creating art projects at this position. The position is very challenging and emotionally demanding. The work is gratifying, but poorly organized, and there is no training and limited staff support. Communication and leadership are very strained throughout the division, and new projects often supersede ongoing concerns. The office is cross-generational, with a very specific hierarchy and ever-shifting expectations. There is also an above-average amount of physical labor that is divided specifically by gender. Compensation is well below average for the demanded skill-sets. Fun to start but the stress wore me out. I had an enjoyable career in Pittsburgh. As a police officer your always dealing with other people’s problems. So, you learn to solve problems between family members and neighborhood disputes. I wears on you after a period of time. All of my bosses were great. As much overtime as you want Didn’t see family a great deal of the time 3 2 Good place to work Enjoy working with all of the people there. I do one on one instruction to prepare students to get their GED. Everyone gets along and work toward help our residents. Enjoy my time there I enjoyed working with the clients that were referred by the Dept. of Public Welfare. Each case was different and you could become a productive and positive part of someone's life. Seeing the success that developed over the years gave me hope that I was doing the right thing and in the right job. My life now is being a servant. it was a hustle environment For the most part we got along pretty good, but you had to always be ready to speak up for yourself. A typical day was very hard work. You learned the city and the fast pace of the job made the time go quickly. For me, I love the outdoors and as for management we all did the best with what we had to work with. The hardest was the tonnage the easiest the driving. We cuold leave the work site when we finished We had to make up holidays on saturday Great place to work if you need to build experience and connections. A typical day of work consists of checking the help desk queue and looking for escalated tickets. After that, you pick tickets relevant to your expertise and you work those tickets. I have learned so much about network infrastructure and maintenance and it has helped me build my career immensely. I have also made powerful and influential connections since it is a government job. For the most part my co workers are exceptional. The hardest part of the job is the hours you have to work, and being on call on weekends. The most enjoyable part is having the ability to learn what you want to learn at your pace. Benefits, ability to work on all levels of IT, ease of schedule hours, low morale, short ceiling for advancement. Fun Place to Work Each day is a different day. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you get to work with a bunch of different types of people. Solid start to your career My experience is in the Refuse Department. The only plus to the department is that you have a chance to leave work early when your route is complete beside that there are no real perks to choosing this department to work for at all. We work on Saturdays after every holiday, so family time is cut short during the important times of the year. I would suggest to anyone to try other departments first but if you need to a job to earn a paycheck for the time being there's plenty of trash out there for everyone. Early start, some weekends advancement, pay This was my second attempt at court reporting, and I tried but just couldn't feel productive. This position was taking verbatim minutes at hearings of different levels and then transcribing them. I liked working in City Governement. Every day was the same thing. Best Summer Jobs Working outside doing manual labor. Seeing all your friends from school. Government I work with a highly educated and motivated staff, that are out to provides the best service for the residents of the City of Pittsburgh. productive and enjoyable place to work I learned a lot working with the city. I've gained a lot of experience interacting with the public .. Productive, accomplished workplace with passionate, dedicated coworkers As part of Mayor Ravenstahl’s communications team, I write and edit various types of publications – from press materials to community newsletters – manage social media and web content, conduct research, oversee production of marketing materials, assist with media outreach and event coordination, inform staff about relevant communications information and more. I work with both internal and external entities to complete tasks under firm deadlines – while ensuring quality, consistency and effectiveness – and understand the necessity to maintain a professional and respectful relationship to ensure the advancement of the message and material. Came from private sector back to public sector and it is a leap backwards technically Job is not technically challenging and due to a government IT installation very politically and bureaucratically oriented, Nice people that work there. How to retire due to health problems. Good place to work for, I had to retire due to health problems. good hours deadlines Great People Worked with really nice people. Appreciated the internship opportunity. Highest paying EMS job in the area Although there is the ability to make money by working overtime and special events, the schedule is not very family-friendly. Great experience gained from very busy service with a high call volume. Duties are physically demanding due to terrain and geographical area with many residences being difficult to access. Bargaining unit has failed to secure a contract 15 months after previous contract has expired. uniform quartermaster program, paid continuing education must live within the city limits Fun to start but the stress wore me out. I had an enjoyable career in Pittsburgh. As a police officer your always dealing with other people’s problems. So, you learn to solve problems between family members and neighborhood disputes. I wears on you after a period of time. All of my bosses were great. As much overtime as you want Didn’t see family a great deal of the time 3 2 Not good benefits, but good direct supervisors I overall enjoyed my work here. Wouldn't want to stay here long term as the benefits package is subpar. I would hope for an improvement in the future, but don't count on it. Terrible Was forced out due to residency after 4 years I just feel as though they don't give two cares about their employees. Honestly the hardest part is going above and beyond for a company and then they terminate you. 1 1 Great place to work Great place to work. Plenty of opportunity for growth. Highly recommend. Great work schedule and work life balance. Enjoyable work community and great benefits. Great career place The City of Pittsburgh is a place you can ahave a career you get there and you can work to move up and retire from. The benefits are a great for families. Benefits are great Must live in city limits Horrible place to work Poor training, poor management, no motivation to work and do a good job. Management will reward poor workers by taking work off of them and penalize good workers by adding to their work load. The only way to advance is to ""know"" someone. Can't think of any Poor working enviroment Hectic internship The department was very understaffed and disorganized as a result. Staff was incredibly friendly and dedicated to their work, and always jumping between multiple projects in one day. Flexable with the schedule Great place to work. Fair and work with you when needing time off. Only problem was cost of living raise no merit raises. Enjoyed my time with the city. Willing to be flexible Pay was ok but no merit raises Neat and interesting job with occasional moments of danger Being a firefighter for the city of Pittsburgh was excellent at first. The excitement of actually being a public safety hero, and the entire experience of training school as well. Years later it was evident that there is major downtime. So be prepared for that, find ways to entertain yourself. Productive ways The reputation The downtime Good people to work with Get to do impactful work every day. Nice people to work with. Was stressful as an intern but would be better if in a full-time position. The department director was newer so might have improved government office work is standard office stuff, have decent equipment and good training lots of encouraging e mails and health related info given out. decent work hours for clericals generous time off pay is low good way to get to know the city Working as a public servant is a good way to get to know a city. I learned a lot about the area. Some coworkers were very motivated, others were not.. Job is goin downhill The job is goin downhill. Not enough employees/ men to handle the job as a whole. Mgmt seems to cant get it right niether. We have a union but our union is not really strong enough to deal with mgmt Get paid for 8 hrs regardless of what time you get done. Off on weekends Too many to name Simply sucks Don't waste your time. $15 an hour to put up with Bulls***. Has gotten worse over the year. And, expected to get more worse. Soon to be short staffed. Find another place. Trust me, this place isn't worth it. None Everything Long Time Ago I'm only filling this out to make the indeed notification go away. I haven't worked for the City in over ten years. Since then, a new mayor was elected who did not keep any of the managerial staff with whom I worked. I have no idea what it's like to presently work for the City. Look some place else Poor leadership, no good benefits low pay increases. Would not recommend the city of Pittsburgh to anyone looking for a police career. A lot of hard work for very little satisfaction. Nice Place and People • Created 6 KPIs to measure reporting hours, overtime rate and reporting fatigue; Decreased reporting time variations by 50% and saved the department $17,003 annually • Initiated Time Study and Reporting quality survey for both Policemen and Firefighters; Collected responses and analyzed to identify reporting wastes and largest variations; Created Tableau dashboards to present insights to stakeholders Great place to work Filled with people who love their job and want to contribute to the community. Very welcoming environment. I was only there for a short time but everyone was willing to work together to get the job done Nothing, it was law enforcement. No, I no longer work there. It changed every day. No two days were the same. I have nothing to add. If you watch tv, you can get an idea of what it is like to work. Pretty good Not a bad employer, other employees are somewhat territorial. Systematically, old school i processes. Experience solely based on department and supervisor structure. Best job ever enjoy working with the kids The enjoyable part of the job is safety of the children coming to school and getting home from school in a safely matter everyday and to see the smiles The experience working with the kids None"
Texas Instruments|" High energy results driven environment for sales TI is a good company that values its employees and compensates them well. There is an overall team atmosphere and everyone is expected to know their roles and responsibilities and perform them accordingly. Losing its mojo TI used to be a great place to work with a great environment. They were slow to react to the high attrition which has snowballed to cause more attrition. The reaction of management has to gas light the remaining employees and nothing has changed. They are about to lose the culture that made TI a great place to work. Layback but horrible management I don't like the constant harassment from management. Not enough training that can potentially get you hurt. A lot of work everyday with people who don't like working there. The better you are at your job, the more responsibility without a pay increase. The better you are at your job, the more responsibility without a pay increase. If you are reliable, you get more work and negative reviews for not performing. Do the bare minimum and people are rewarded for not making mistakes. You do not receive positive marks for evaluations on performance, but negative marks can prevent raises. If you're good at your job, you will become a workhorse and burn out. Less work equals less mistakes. I've enjoyed my time I've liked my time at TI. The people there are easy to get along with and easy to move around the company if you want to experience different roles. . Great Great company to work for. Benefits for diabetic did not hold up. TI will train you do the job and safety is there number one priority. Morning meeting can run a little long for night shift working which is terrible for commuters. Good company One of the best jobs Ive had. Not the best pay but still pretty good,envuorment was mostly working parents responsible adults. If I had the opportunity to work there again I would in a second. 4 stars What is the best part of working at the company? its work environment, the improvements in the services, the deliveries on time and the quality of the products with which it works What is the most stressful part about working at the company?

Stability, nice people, just a pleasant place to work long term! What is the most stressful part about working at the company? There might have been stressful jobs but mine was never stressful. If you have a deadline on something you're working on...that could be stressful... What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Environment was always good...I worked there for 26 years. The reason I quit was because we moved out of state... What is a typical day like for you at the company? I worked 8-5pm. Rarely any overtime. A great place to work! Great pay Paid on time and okay schedule. Sometimes there was unprofessionalism amongst coworkers and bosses. But it still is a great job to work. Loved working for TI Best and brightest colleagues. Compensation for innovation. It was the best job of my career. Management was on top of all of the key business metrics and conducted thorough quarterly reviews with the engineering staff. Emphasis on continuous improvement made the job interesting every day. Productive Honestly it’s easy work for a good pay. Only thing is working 12 hours long, some days will be stressful depending on the partner you have, but other than that it’s very easy to learn. Great leadership that supports diversity The workplace culture at Texas Instruments was phenomenal. New ideas were well received by leadership. Employees were treated with respect and diversity was valued. Nice balance and interesting work TI is a great place to work. In my experience, the leadership does try to explain decisions, and help people do thier best. Compensation was good, maybe not awesome but good. It seemed that everyone had pretty good work life balance Good place to work, variety of opportunities This is a great place to work if you are intellectually curious. I've seen many people move across various functions and roles so you will never get bored. strong talent, smart people, good pay (with profit sharing) senior mgmt can be disconnected Stressful work environment and Lack of manpower *Good benefits and job security. *Micromanagement, politics, gossips everywhere. * Lack of manpower leading to burnout and loaded workloads. * Lack of mentorship Shuttle service, meal allowance, 13th and 14th month pay, profit sharing, loaded trainings 12hrs shift, no work-life balance, too much workload, exhausting work environment, limited socials Productive work place The company is good is good benefits. There is always opportunity for growth and development. Management support teams are also willing to extend help Great place to work Lots of great people and tech to work with. Relatively good lab support and clear direction. CEO has a good outlook on all aspects of the company. Pay is pretty good for Dallas. Bonuses are a big plus, but not guaranteed. Ethical and honest Great company to work for, but pay is a little low for my job title. While my organization allows a lot of flexibility in work location, TI as a company will never be 100% remote for my job role. Superb upper management, foresight and execution are world class TI has been an interesting place to work over the past 30 years. Going from a mass market Digital focused company to the Analog/Mixed signal Market leader with commensurate doubling of Gross Margins. The upper management is very good, able to see macro factors and to recognize there will be upturns after the down turns, and build for them. Positioning in Industrial and Automotive segments to capture long product tails stabilizes revenue and enhances profits. The investment in domestic 300mm Analog production on trailing nodes has been very successful, allowing others to invest in bleeding edge digital processes while harvesting the learnings to retain customers. In an era of vendor consolidation they are one that is hard to exclude, and which has the breadth to replace many of the competition. As an engineer, your value is recognized World wide sales, primarily domestic wafer manufacturing, enlightened management Dallas centric, but not to a fault Good place to work Good Place to work and balance work-life and good benefit. The management works to help employees to advance. The health benefit and Insurance are tailored to employees' needs. it has a Good Health care Insurance choice Profit Saring Stock purchase High energy results driven environment for sales TI is a good company that values its employees and compensates them well. There is an overall team atmosphere and everyone is expected to know their roles and responsibilities and perform them accordingly. Easy but monotonous You will be doing the same thing everyday all day long. Not much opportunity for growth, especially without a specific degree. Good benefits once you are hired permanently. Corporate America at its worst Honestly working here really tainted my view of the corporate world. They pretend to care about you but all they care about is production and efficiency. They are exclusive and if you don't get ""in"" with management early on you have no chance for success. 1 Fun but stressful It is fun but stressful. Expect night meetings with asia factories. The role can be good or bad depending on your team. Overall good place if you want to seek technical growth. It is a good place to work. There was no training, but you can just learn while working with your co-workers. Over all it is a very nice place to work. I have been in the semiconductor industry for over 30 years. Ti is also a good place like other semi. Industry. I'm vary happy working for ti. Texas Instruments If you've ever seen Willie Wonk a and the Chocolate factory (without the chocolate) it's somewhat like that, very massive inside and out with rooms for prayer, feeding and free food for newbies, working in the fab clean room you wear smock head to toe, no sitting no talking. Way too many check points and random searches as some floors require a special clearance for a 12 hrs shift being on your feet can be a lot even with specially provided shoes. TI seemed to care a lot about their employee, even gave out stock options to those we were full time, allowed time to attend college and seen that employee were heard by way of monthly health and wellness checks, massive break rooms, dont plan to leave for lunch unless you can go to subway come back make it through the gate find parking, again and make it through all the check points, its a trap. also theres a store within TI that worked on integrity, grab now pay later-ish Purpose but can lose yourself in the process Great place to start as an engineer in facilities. You have a purpose but your role may not be exactly what the job title states. I am doing a lot more project management of controls engineering versus doing actual controls engineering work. Due to the current chip shortage everyone is rushing so it can get really busy, and you can burn out it you don't take time off. 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Work life balance, OT after 8 hours, DT after 60. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? If you make a mistake you can cause a lot of downtime so it is stressful. Good environment Decent pay, Good benefits, good environment, nice co-workes my supervisor and managers are very flexible. Space for growth, it’s a good company to work for Needs Improvements 1. Slow career growth 2. Low salary increase, there is politics involved 3. Poor people management, managers are more concern of factory output 4. No retention program for employee If your not use to working 12hrs then may not be a good fit Overall they pay was pretty good but the people and there attitudes were not the greatest trying to learn something they kinda expect you to just know what to do right off some are better then others when it comes training you properly and others just don’t care to or they’ll get mad when you make a mistake Flexible There is a great deal of flexibility in certain positions. I had some great coworkers. Some supervisors and managers are great. Profit sharing is the greatest benefit the company offers & have not found any other like it. decent starting pay consitent shifts and a good place for coworker friendships decent starting pay shifts are allways the same lots of intresting coworkers learn to use complicated high tech factory tools cleanroom enviroment may be a hard adjustment for some people Great management great people to work with Great management team easy to work with Work is steady but not hard. multiple shifts and days can be done to meet your needs. Only left because I moved to another state. Low pay, micromanaging, ancient equipment, high turnover We are expected to keep a high pace and product turnout with ancient machines that are broken down as often as not (many 30-40 years old). Despite management knowing of mechanical failures, the blame is placed on employees consistently. Due to a lack of equipment technicians, age of equipment, and often a lack of parts, equipment can sit dormant for weeks to months, or break down multiple times a day. Supervisors frequently berate employees to the point of rage. On multiple occasions I have witnessed a shift supervisor berate an employee to the point where the employee lashed out and struck an object. Complaints have been filed through HR, but affected employees tend to quit before anything happens. Long term employees appear resigned that HR will do nothing about the toxic culture. There is no room for advancement. People stay in the same pay bracket for years at a time, waiting for one of the older employees to finally retire so a slot comes open. Pay raises cap out at around 4%, and are merit-based. Expect raises to be under the rate of inflation. Due to many job functions being locked off to higher pay grades, tasks become backlogged due to a lack of qualified employees. Again, management knows this but has made no moves to fix the problem aside from threatening mandatory overtime. High turnover has increased burnout among long-timer employees as they've had to frequently pick up the slack when positions go unfilled for months at a time. When asked how the company can better hire and keep employees, the topic of pay raises was broached. Management's response was Okay place to work Benefits can be great if you’re in a business-facing role, or average if not. Work-life balance is non-existent. Managers care about your growth in your career and will help you get to where you want to be. Political and enslaving At TI, advancement is mostly political. I was personally passed over for an internal position in favor of a candidate with much less experience, but who possessed the most important feature: XX chromosomes. TI requires engineers to work during the day, then they must log on and continue working when they go home. TI engineers must also work on weekends and holidays. TI will usually allow workers to take time off, but with a catch: you have to work while you're on time bank. TI also demands that employees take experimental drugs, which don't protect a person from any illness. The drugs are known to have many serious side effects including death. I can't think of any pros about working at TI. I had to work through lunch on most days, Managers are frequently abusive and demeaning, TI throws engineers into new areas and provides them with no training, They literally say ""now you own this process/equipment, so you're the expert"", and you're looking at the process and equipment for the first time. Very efficient, as a company very profitable year after year Great company to start career. Diverse product portfolio. Diverse customer base and end applications. Great opportunity to travel, learn, and contribute. do NOT work in Manufacturing at TI Negatives: Each building is run like a separate company. TI gets great reviews from those outside the manufacturing buildings (Fabs), this can be misleading. ""Make"", as they call it collectively, is a series of frantic sweatshops with competing priorities. Engineering and Manufacturing within each Fab are pitted against each other (by upper management). When goals aren't reached one group has to take the blame and the accompanying consequences. Stress remains extremely high every day. Positives: Tuition reimbursement allows you to progress in your career. Inclusion is outstanding, for all groups. Team approach work environment. People you work with participant in projects, etc. with a team attitude working all together. They have very good advancement opportunities across the company. Recognition of accomplishments. Long hours when troubleshooting problems. Great Love working there. Great company to work for. Great benefits and the managers are really nice. Working for the company for a while. Was able to work from home during covid. High energy results driven environment for sales TI is a good company that values its employees and compensates them well. There is an overall team atmosphere and everyone is expected to know their roles and responsibilities and perform them accordingly. Productive workplace, with a dynamic environment. Managers are really friendly, pretty decent benefits, and decent pay with good bonuses. There is a good sense of communication between the engineers 1 Avoid this place. Production workers expect to make 15hr for first shift and 15% increase for nights. They do offer profit sharing but must of it gets taken away with taxes. The maximum salary increase is about 1-2% ones a year. The health insurance is super expensive and is a terrible HSA high deductible plan. After taxes you can expect to bring home 1k every 2 weeks. 2 The job is pretty layed back, but with a steep learning curve Raises are annual and don't keep up with inflation. If you want to advance, you need a good reputation and to move from role to role. Decently easy as management or an engineer, but very difficult as a technician. Wokeness is becoming more of an issue. Extremely understaffed, No advancement opportunity, very poor management, 12 hour shifts This is about MFAB in particular, but there is horrible culture at this place. They have you cover for people who have quit with no intention of ever filling the position. You won't get credit for this, only complaints if you can't keep up. They offer promotions that never come, or, if they do, it's only after they make you work the promoted job for a year to ""prove you deserve it"". Pizza a couple times a year. Bonus based on company performance Short tightly monitored breaks, bad insurance plan, rough hours, terrible management Challenging and supportive work environment. I was working at Silicon Systems that got bought out by Texas Instruments. Was relocated to larger wafer fab facility to manage the EH&S operation. The transition was good and made the job more challenging. Good management support for running the EH&S operation. I would recommend this employer. Challenging, opportunity to develop professional experience and education in the EH&S field. 24/7 operation, long hours sometime. Dangerous technical workplace. Clean environment and comfortable environment. Supervisors can be pushy and unrelatable I just the atmosphere. Fun place to work and make friends for life. Supervisors think they are superior and know it all. Supervisors had no compassion. Fun at first, quickly limiting Good as a starter job, pay doesn't keep up with the market. You get moved around with no input. Not worth the hassle. Lots of good people, but they're all leaving Great internship opportunity Great internship program that gave me real work and clear goals. Hard to make real connections virtually, but everyone I reached out to was willing to help in any way they could. Challenging and gratifying work Enjoyed the challenging work and opportunities to expand your knowledge and experience, but could’ve been a much better place to work if not for the politics. Politics Good place to work. Too many layers of management Challenging work, 3 or 4 day work weeks were great. A lot of management turnover and too many layers of management led to micromanaging at times. A lot of walking in a clean room environment if that is an issue. Benefits are really good. Pay raises are low though. Slow and unorganized Unorganized and very quick to get you out the door after a mistake. willing to offer relocation at least but after initial training your expected to be completely familiar with the tools on your area. I work in DFAB. I am a very creative and collaborative individual. This job, a manufacturing specialist, is so-so. Beware DFAB day shift. (I would advise working night shift, very relaxed environment) If you want to meet people that care and want to do great things in life, often it’s not at jobs like these. Pretty boring job I worked here for a couple months and the work was pretty easy its just a boring job, very repetitive and they also don't respect your choice to be unvaccinated, that is why I no longer work there. Just a number at TI This is a stable company to work for. Good benefits and an annual bonus up to 20 %. But you'll get worked to the point if exhaustion. Retention is very poor,so those who remain get more and more work piled up on them. Management is concerned with metrics and goals more than a culture that values it's employees. Stable company to work for Overworked, under paid. Poor management culture More pay For the amount of work and tools you run per night the pay should be way more. If you don’t get assigned a trainer that’s actually still interested in their job then good luck. A lot of people quit due to poor training and being continuously overworked. Nice breaks, great campus Bad management, bad HR, too much work Casual work environment but management can be an obstacle I have been a contractor at Texas Instruments for a long time. Being a contractor is a lot different from being an employee. They treat the employees much better than the contractors. The corporate comms team, in my experience, has a lot of turnover and work can be inconsistent. Very conservative approach to creative. Hours and work environment is mostly casual and flexible, but overall the creative freedom is lacking. Work environment, flexibility, resources Conservative creative approach, Upper management is an obstacle A non-stressful work environment with great benefits TI was an ok company to work for. Pay was good, raises were not, benefits were good. The work was easy, in a clean room, temperature controlled environment. Most of the managers were decent and caring and kept the heat from rolling down hill so you could concentrate on the task at hand. Diffusion Engineering Technician The company pays well but the job is dangerous. Management doesn't listen to any suggestions to make things better or more efficient. You are left to learn the job on your own. There is good training on how the factory works, but next to no formal training on the job. Good pay, no boring days dangerous, inadequate PPE Depends on the team It matters more the team you work for as opposed to the company. The company does not care for its people very well, but an individual team is open to buck the company culture. Any young guy can do the job In general experienced people are excluded from promotions. Not a very friendly corporate culture for ages >40 Lots of talented and very experienced colleagues already left for that reason. Some of the were ""asked"" to reconsider their careers there. salary culture High energy results driven environment for sales TI is a good company that values its employees and compensates them well. There is an overall team atmosphere and everyone is expected to know their roles and responsibilities and perform them accordingly. Good place to work good Job, as a tech but must be willing to work weekends, off shift, holidays..etc. Basically got to work around engineers schedule. I worked mon thru Friday supporting BU engineering development activities. Flex schedule need b.s. Degree to advance Working with world wide teams Great company to work for this company. Management was great and people were great. Location was great and travel was to many countries and enjoyed the travel TI Germany, Italy, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark. Company provided great opportunity to advance. I started as as a design engineer and promoted to section manager, product engineering Manager, promoter to worldwide Product engineering and design manager with more tjan 100 people reporting to me across th world. None None 1 Great benefits, good pay, bonus is a plus! The days are long but working 3 or 4 days a week make it easier to get through. Working environment is safe and clean. The benefits are cheaper than most companies I've seen and the annual bonus is awesome! Benefits, pay, job security, short work week Long days (12 hours) Long Hours, Low Pay, No benefits for contractors. I was one of the lucky ones beginning through the staffing agency at at time where a permanent offer would be made to me in less than a year. I have had a difficult time working these long hours, overnights, for lets face it, mediocre pay. And I was doing all this work week after week, not thinking about how it will pay off when made permanent, but rather how could I possibly change this workplace enough for me + my coworkers to be living our best lives by remaining here. I am not sure it's possible. We are all repetitive-strain-injuring ourselves due to high demand in semiconductor industry right now paired with medieval tools and equipment our work area is outfitted with. But for every one of my coworkers I see working hard, hustling day-in-day-out like I thought unsustainable when I first started, I regularly see a corresponding employee nodding off with nothing to do, or abusing breaks + lunches for twice the allocated time away from work, because of the honor system. It's not even a seniority thing here, there are just as many experienced vets pulling 150% work ethic while newer younger folks move at their own pace. Upper management might as well be military, they will go though the motions of asking for ideas and input on how to improve processes in the fab. But true intentions are confusing and hard to pin down at all with upper management. My direct supervisor is as caring and effective a manager as any I have ever had, probably more so. Their positive energy is swamped by higher-level managerial ineptitude. It's hard for me to hear about our ideas getting stonewalled Best place to work. The training was so awesome. It was the best place that I have ever worked at. The job was awesome. It remains as the best place that I have worked at. The benefits were great. The products we made were incredible. It was a lot of fun and the culture was fantastic. There were alot of clubs a person could join and endless activities. The place was rich in culture and I recommend working there to everyone. Health club and club for hobbies. Hard to get promoted. Company mandated covid vaccines 3 weeks into employment management comes and tell me in the middle of my shift that all employees have to take covid vaccines in order to keep their job and they gave me a 2 week deadline to do so. I received the covid vaccine under duress in order to remain employed. The same week I received the vaccine I got ill due to the adverse effects of the vaccine. When I needed to call off because I was too ill to work management told me my job was at risk if I miss 2days in row. So I was made to take this vaccine and the company basically told me that I am on my own. I wouldn't have had to call off if I didn't submit to taking the vaccine anyway. Rotating schedule, good pay Company doesnt care about employees Fun and diverse work environment Lots of opportunities to move around laterally and find good mentors. Good support and resources available. Great training opportunities for new employees Ethical Good company, strong business sense, strong sense of ethics. Management has a clear view of what they want. Work life balance is emphasized, but only a reality depending on what role you are in. everyone worked together for the same goal the hardest part about working at Texas Instruments was finding something to do for a full 12 hours. The people at T I working with you are always willing to help very good insurance and benefits working compressed shift at night Stressful and unfulfilling The management is awful and the work culture is absolutely horrible. People are bullied and picked on with no help from supervisors or HR. You work VERY hard for little to no recognition. The hardest working employees get taken advantage of while the lazy ones can do absolutely nothing and get away with it. Being promoted is few and far between. Shifts start at 5:45 am or 5:45 pm. 12 hours, in a clean room in a bunny suit. They tell you its ok to sit and take breaks, but its not. You'll be ridiculed by everyone around you. It's like going back to high school, everyone is mean and you'll constantly be talked about behind your back no matter what you do. You're surrounded by older adults 35-60 years old is the average age. The hardest part of the job is by far dealing with the ineptitude of the upper management. The most enjoyable part of the job is the set schedule and consistent pay. Overtime comes and goes. Nights will make you the most money with the differential but you'll have no life and be absolutely miserable. I don't think I can stress enough how mean the employees are, not only to who your on shift with but the incoming and outgoing shifts as well. I worked there for 4 years and only stayed that long because of the schedule, pay and 401k matching. They just recently became competitive in their pay scale. I received an over 35% increase in pay in 3 years simply because the starting pay was so low they had to eventually increase everyone. They pride themselves on being SAFE, Right then Productive. Thats not the case. Your entire job is to be fast and productive. Set schedule, recently competitive pay, leave work at work See above review Positive work atmosphere A positive, challenging place to work with open communication. It can be stressful if you do don’t pace because you always have something to do. Really good benefits and the profit sharing is quite a perk. Good management, challenging, compensation Overly busy Relaxed professional environment T.I treats alot of the employees with respect and are accommodating to almost anything have two one hour breaks throughout the day. Only thing I can complain on is your going to walk miles and can get very monotonous over time doing the same thing everyday for 12 hours. No electronics and constant movement the entire day in a loud laboratory Two one hour breaks, great benefits and bonuses The monotonous can get to people. Very boring.. Productive and fun workplace with a gym. Though Texas Instruments is beginning to recognize the importance of diversifying its staff with English (Market Communications) and MBA (management) degrees, it is still very much a company of engineers run by engineers. There is good and bad to this, although since I'm an engineer, I mostly loved it. The company is filled with smart people. Everyone is expected to do their part, but not expected to work ridiculous hours (50 on average for salaried employees.) Pay is good. You will be comfortable, although you won't get rich unless you make it into upper management. It's a good place Originally my department was fantastic but like any Company people retire and normal relaxed department that always got the job down. Now the department has several people in middle management compared to the worker bees. Change is always hard but this change was beyond difficult Profit sharing Pay The place to cut corners Too dependent on rotators to get the job done. Some managers have lost their engineering touch and cannot take a single piece of data in the lab. That’s what rotators are for. Get ready to qualify subpar products, “automotive grade” them and wait for returns 2 years later. Oh but by that time, you’ll be gone! If you cut corners, you will get rewarded and promoted. By the time the ship sinks, you’ll be elsewhere. TI promotes a false sense of corporate stewardship. You’ll hear things like “pay for performance” and “ignore the background noise” when management reorganizes your team every quarter. They put on a really good show. The environment in the Fab is chaos. Temps don’t know anything. Full time employees don’t have the time or interest in making sure they do. Management is unorganized. The long time employees, with the help of management, cut corners, damage product, and blame temps to get them fired. If you are going to work in the Fab...Good luck. Work-life balance Stressful work environment, Manipulative employees Awful company!? Worst company I have ever worked for on 40 years of working!!! Don't ever work for this company, trust me. No one talks to you and the culture is soooo bad that you hate going to work everyday!!!!! Excellent employer I was an overnight shift supervisor. I thought TI was a great place to work. Very good benefits and employee work life balance. Gym and Game Center onsite. Excellent benefits None really Diverse work atmosphere with down-to-earth associates. Working in the cleanroom wasn’t bad at all. The people were very nice and I had no problems with coworkers. Working 12 hour shifts is not so bad when you get 3-4 days off a week. I would have stayed if I could. Yearly bonus, holiday bonus, 2 year advancement from contacted work Breaks could be longer Great Employees, difficult task Work was fun and challenging at times. My coworkers were very supportive and managers as well, but there were soo mnay moving pieces it's hard to keep up with all the task they required you to do Nice cafe, ability to work from home Challenging, draining High energy results driven environment for sales TI is a good company that values its employees and compensates them well. There is an overall team atmosphere and everyone is expected to know their roles and responsibilities and perform them accordingly. Productive Workplace TI is a great company to grow within. There is room for growth. The environment is very nice and professional. The company really take care of their employees. 1 Very innovation oriented company. Very innovation oriented company. Opportunity to grow your career early at the Texas instruments. Moving up to a general manager position does not take long, but may be filled with risk. That said, this happens in any job. The ability to quickly find out if you are capable of handling a GM job can be done for you at Texas instruments very early in your career. You don’t have to wait 20 years to get there. Lots of innovation Like any job expectations are high 1 Neat place to work. I appreciate that I could show up a little late or take a longer lunch break just so long as I attended all meetings and completed my tasks on time. Don’t expect this to be the case company-wide since there are so many different arms and branches within this large organization. My work was plentiful and I felt appreciated until my long-time boss quickly died of cancer. After that, I was shuttled off to a different division that wasn’t very well aligned with my skill set. That lasted a few years and then the company slowly removed their contract employees. I was one of the last to be let go. There was some flexibility within the work hours, as long as you were completing your tasks. There was little chance of advancement, but I blame that on the fact that I was a contractor and not a regular employee. Good Place if you need a job If you need somewhere to work this is a decent place but pay is poor. Supervisors are incompetent. Benefits however are good, shifts are good as well. Shifts, benefits Pay, Supervisors Great people, 20% profit sharing! TI has a strong culture of integrity, and as a result you will be surrounded by good people. People are willing to help each other out, and you don't have to always be watching your back. We have maxed out profit sharing for several years in a row, and that is a fantastic bonus! Profit sharing, people Cliques can exist at the upper management level. Leading edge technology If you are good in analog design semiconductors this company provides endless challenges. The management has many years of experience in customer satisfaction. Company has a long history of profit and many key customers are in China and Asia. Engineering design work is done in both US and India. profit sharing 60 hour work weeks Double standard regulation Double standard regulation for different employees especially when it comes to tech ladder. People do not get rewarded fairly. It is based on connection rather the work quality. They advertise about talent development but it is just a show not reality compressed shift work allows for more home life Job revolves around production efficiency, which can be a stressful environment when the company is trying to meet harsh deadlines for customers. Currently high turnover rate, putting existing employees in a constant state of training the new hire until they quit and then it's on to the next new hire. Could be a great company, but .... TI make management changes often. Getting away from innovation and now focus on cutting costs to return investment to share holders. Lots of people leaving the company. Just dont Probably the worst job ever, everything is your fault, managers and supervisors have nothing but attitudes, you miss 3 days of work ( even if you call ahead ) you are told you can’t take another day off in two months, worst place to work. They “ train “ you the most sh!tty way possible. And they do nothing but criticize you. So yea RUN AWAY! Everything Ineffective process to follow all the time As a developer, I feel extremely frustrated to implement my daily job here at TI because of the ineffective and lousy ""process"" that you have to follow. Anything easy and straightforward needs to go through a lengthy process. Nothing Bad management, red tape, low benefit good pay and benefits. work/balance not so good. No issues with CEO or mgmt. Pay and benefits are pretty good. Work/life balance is not good. I have for the most part had good bosses over the years and there are lots of folks to reach out to within TI if you have questions. Very ethical which I like. Pay + Benefits work/life imbalance Great culture, opportunity to move Bright talent and strong values makes for a good work culture. Rotation programs for new college graduates, and a great summer intern program. Good health benefits, a gym, and even a concierge. Good benefits, culture, and opportunities to do new work. Typical stress related to doing more without additional resources. Everything is life or death there is no room for error or mistakes Everything is always an urgency when something happens , it's always rush rush rush to get something corrected, or it gets put on the back burner for years until the equipment is run to failure. Definitely a culture change from what I'm used to. Everyone seems depressed all the time and I now see why. Compressed pay Horrible way of operating their systems Boring and no where to grow Definitely not the place it was when I started. They've continued to strip back roles and remove responsibility. If you like working within a very narrow box, this is your place. Profit sharing, good base No upward mobility, company culture Co workers Management was very poor and never gave you a chance to prove yourself and never communicated with his employees and was very bad at his job and would take up for his lazy employees that were always late Benefits Poor management Great place to develop technical skills. A good place for entry-level programmers to develop their skills, leading to other job opportunities within and outside of TI. They provide substantial course work in many areas allowing you to develop your skills. Good training. Bland environment. Excellent pay Excellent benefits package and pay. Overtime is after 8 hours everyday, so on a 11.5 hour compressed work day, 3.5 hours is at time and a half. Shifts are 3 days one week and 4 days the next. No rotation, shifts stay the same. Also 15% for night shift premium. Good benefits and ability to move around in a big company Benefits and compensation are good. And since it is a big company it is easier to move around if you want something new within the company. You get some certainty and stability with such a big company. But there is a constant ""do more with less"" attitude where management wants ""10% more productivity, growth, product throughout"" but doesnt want to hire more people to the team,give more resources, or raises. You just have to work harder to meet these arbitrary goals with the same of everything and it leads to a toxic environment. Sweat shop It's a large company with a large company attitude. It's a sweat shop. Management is unfocused and provides little direction, especially for new hires. They do have excellent resources for getting the job done."
CommScope|" Pays extremely well The pay is almost unbeatable for the skill set required. Other than that, it’s an ok place to work. Management isn’t that good, but it could be worse. If you don’t mind working 12 hours on a 4 on 4 off schedule, it’s decent The pay Management 1 Thank you for taking the time to leave us your review. At CommScope, our goal is to be competitive and offer the best compensation packages for our employees. We appreciate your honest feedback and know that your review helps us improve the company. Great Pay. Work Life Balance. Management needs improvement It is a very clean and rewarding place to work when everything runs smoothly, however, when things go wrong, or lines are down, it can be rough. Unless you’re a helper, you’re going to be running around trying to fix everything, but if you can’t fix it call maintenance!!! There’s no communication between management and employees until the Supervisor is walking close to your line, so if you’re down for an hour they’re going to want to know why you’re down and they might chastise you for the lack of production. As far as the job and the people it’s a great place to work as well as start a career. There is favoritism, and there is a good ole boys club, but if you get blessed with a good supervisor as 75% of employees do, you’ll be just fine. I learned a lot about the fiber optic cable manufacturing process, as well as many leadership principles while working here. The hardest part of the job for me was staying awake and engaged as the shifts are 12 hours, 4 days on 4 days off (The best schedule I’ve ever worked). You will not regret working here. Great people poor leadership Data driven decisions really only happen if the data agrees with the upper management's opinion. Notice I used upper management and not leadership? There is no leadership in this company. You are given 10 projects and told all are the number one priority so everyone just does their favorite part of any of the projects. The result is it takes a long time to get anything done. That is probably the best example of a lack of leadership. Other than that, I really enjoy working with all the people at the lower levels. The people at the lower levels working hard No leadership. No decisions to clarify vision. Thank you for your honest feedback. We aim to foster an environment where each person is heard. Hearing the pros and cons of working at CommScope will help us become better moving forward. We know that all jobs aren't right for all people. We are aware of the comments and are working to address those issues. 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Machine operator What is the most stressful part about working at the company? When somebody make you mad What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Very clean and everybody is respectful What is a typical day like for you at the company? Respect one another Great and fun place to work with opportunities to advance in work experience. I enjoyed working for Commscope because I was given the opportunity to learn and advance in different work roles. What I enjoyed the best was learning the importance of practicing safety towards oneself and towards our fellow work partners in the warehouse facility. Productive and fun place to work. Commscope is a great place to work with great benefits and pay. You feel as if you are part of the company. Upper management and HR listen to employees. Good Products but poor execution Had a terrible onboarding experience. They misclassified me as a contractor. Setup my account with a shortened version of my name. It took me months to get this resolved. Peers were a joy to work with. Very professional and knowledgeable. Products are not industry leading. Not certified to run on primary Government networks. A tough sell when you have to lead with price. No raise in the 18+ months I worked there. Commissions were delayed as they pay on shipping not booking. With the supply chain issues, you have to wait months to get payment. Good sales professionals have left due to the payment issues and no available product. The see better opportunities with competitors that have certified products with a much larger market to sell into. Manager was nice but hands off. No training product training offered. Soft skill training for new hires out of college. No advanced technical training at all. It's a big company with people holding on until retirement. I'm glad they cut me loose. The stress level wasn't worth the lower pay. Good people to work with. WIFI products work well. Low compensation, high attrition rate, poor employee morale. valoran mas a los conosidos y a los que les hacen la barba k a los k hacen el trabajo si eres conosido de los jefes te dan la preferencia y tu ya puedes dar ordenes y aunque seas el mejor trabajador si no les haces la barba no te toman en cuenta asi pue ahi es mas de conosidos y barberos que trabajadores la vdd no lo recomiendo A bad apple in every barrel For the most part I enjoy my job. I like my current supervisor. Not so much my prior supervisor Quarterly bonuses are helpful I like running a machine. If you stay busy the shift goes by quick. Cafeteria food is ok. Getting expensive. Laid back Great pay and great place to work. Management is fair and willing to listen. Schedule is a 12 hr. 4 days on 4 days off. The way schedule falls you get a month of weekends off with a four day check and a 3 day check and have to work weekends the next month A very good place to work. They always treated me well The good far outweighs the bad. I would highly recommend CommScope to someone looking for a good place to work. The only reason I left was I wanted to grow in another line of work. Great Great place to work great training pretty layed back jobs not hard they treat everyone really good they dont yell at you everyone will help you at a drop of a hat Different schedules is different departments. Pay is pretty good and a flexible schedule if you don’t mind working 12 hour shifts It’s a job. The 4x4 schedule is a plus if you can stay on it. I’ve had 3 supervisors in a year and a half so it’s hard to believe anybody knows what they’re doing. 4x4 schedule Management is always changing. Productive and good workplace Busy busy busy! Dynamic and always working on a new plan. Hardest part of the job is getting transportation to ship and have goods arrive on time. Always racing against the clock but that makes it challenging and enjoyable too when fulfilled. Colleagues; Remuneration; Results Losing little of Company Culture; not always Pro-Active The job was good while it lasted I started the first part of February 2020. Six weeks later we were sent home to work for two weeks to ""flatten the curve"" like the rest of the world. Well, I was work from home until I recieved my RIF email and Zoom meeting in November. I did receive a very fair separation package, so I couldn't complain. Heck, I was pleasantly surprised when I received a bonus in 2021 for 2020. Free coffee Work slowed due to COVID-19 Great Company Great company but needs to train managers better. Most managers are friends of someone else at the company. No real management experience is needed for the position. Laid back place to work Great coworkers. Everyone works well together. Most supervisors are fair and supportive. Don't sense the same feelings from upper management. Overall a good place to work Great place to work I love working here pay is great and work is enjoyable. The people are very helpful and the supervisor leave you alone. Just made a career move and it's been one of the better moves I've made. Pay, benefits They make you use all of your personal time for covid Sales development program is amazing and I would highly recommend!!! I love CommScope. This is my first job in sales and I was scared I was going to hate it. Don’t get me wrong, no one loves cold calling. And while I think some things in training can be improved, management actually asks and listens to what we have to say about it. Our VP of Sales operations actually took the time to talk to each of us individually and genuinely seems to care. I’ve never worked at a place as supportive as CommScope. I’m in the sales development program, which I know is different than just starting off as an SDR and new, and if you get the opportunity to join a future class I HIGHLY recommend it. The management in the Charlotte office are great and the whole vibe is the best I’ve had in a work place. Put in the work and you won’t be disappointed. Positive work place Management listens Great to get your foot in the door Training could use some revamp A LOT of information to learn in a short amount of time Very good work culture. Very good work culture. Ample opportunities to learn and grow. Very supportive colleagues. I feel happy to be working here and be part if this amazing team. Terrible Got shafted from “moving up” like a lot of other people, left for something better. Held off on bonuses, almost all of the upper leadership left after a very poor acquisition of Arris. They were doing well before that. They successfully scared away most of their most senior internal technical people to save a dollar, and look at their long term stock outlook now. Do not join this company. Pays extremely well The pay is almost unbeatable for the skill set required. Other than that, it’s an ok place to work. Management isn’t that good, but it could be worse. If you don’t mind working 12 hours on a 4 on 4 off schedule, it’s decent The pay Management 1 Thank you for taking the time to leave us your review. At CommScope, our goal is to be competitive and offer the best compensation packages for our employees. We appreciate your honest feedback and know that your review helps us improve the company. Good company Best place to work . With good people to work with , good place to learn and grow. I wish I should still be working here. I will apply when ever I will get suitable job there. Good pay No 1 Thank you so much for the kudos -- we're thrilled and humbled that your experience has earned us five stars! Having the support to make you successful and able to voice my opinion. Your able to learn as much as your willingly accept work in your role. I have a great supportive team whom strive for excellence and have a world of knowledge across the board. Able to learn as much as you want Job security We appreciate the five star review! On behalf of all CommScope employees, we thank you for your dedication to our customers and our business. We sincerely hope you continue to share your #CommScopeLife with others. Culture Employers at CommScope are looking for animated individuals who are problem-solvers and who can thrive in a fast-paced environment. In addition, they want workers who put customers' needs first and who will contribute to the excellent guest experience. Specifically, this company builds its team with ""unique, caring and fun people."" Lax work environment No one in upper management has any idea as to the real work being done on the production floor. Communication between shifts is non existant, so if you show up for an overtime day, no one is going to know what you're there for. They pay is nice, but they treat you like you're easily replaced, and to them, you are. Mangment Bad manger bad lead treat workers poor change schedule with no time for you to adjust they don’t are about there employees it’s there way or your gone turn over rate is crazy because they don’t care about the worker Awesome place to work great pay I love working at comscope, it's easy, liad back and a worderful place to work...nothing hard about job.. awesome pay....Good people, love it,..❤ 😍 3 30 minute breaks, liad back easy work, awesome pay... 4 day checks one month 3 day checks next....but great place to work 3 day paychecks hurt, some supervisors lie. With 4x4 schedule you will have one month with 4 day paychecks and next month you will have 3 day paychecks. You are told promotions to day shift are based on seniority but I have had 8+ people hired straight to days that started after me. Now suddenly we are on a job bidding freeze. They will lie to keep you on night shift. Also the low level management is hit or miss. The buddy and good Ole boy system is in effect on certain shifts. Pay is decent if you didn't have to worry about 3 day checks every other month. Insurance is cheap. Good work to life balance and insurance. 4x4 pay schedule, some supervisors. They lie about job bidding and seniority. 12 hour night shift can be rough if you are not used to it, is the only thing bad I can say The opportunity to advance and do more if you are willing is there. The training is there but you just have to be persistent and a bit of a self motivating person. I have learned many skills at CommScope that I can take with me to advance in other jobs for instance I learned to operate a forklift safely. I learned how to operate an extruder line independently and make quality fiber optic cable. The management team was great for the most part and understanding of situations and circumstances that people encounter in life. Overall my experience at CommScope was great and I have learned so much and appreciate my experience and time there. The weekly pay. 12 hour work shifts good place to work, with excellent pay and benefits. good place to work, with excellent pay and benefits. It was the best place i ever worked with good people and manager. I learnt a lot there. Very clean environment. good people Plenty of work but not enough resources Too many odd jobs crammed into major projects. People asking to squeeze in their projects into the weekend. If you are high or middle in the pyramid, you are still expected to work as hard as the workers. Plenty of work No teamwork A good place to work as a SW engineer I enjoyed my time with CommScope working as a SW engineer developing code for STB's in Horsham, Pa. I got laid off in late April of 2020 and miss all the good times and work challenges from 20+ years of working there. Good compensation and work / life balance Lack of vision on part of management Terrible The company just split into 2. There have been mass layoffs for months, now. The company has no clear motivation. The HR department is absolutely terrible. I would not recommend this place to anyone. Coffee in the break rooms. poor healthcare plan, poor severance policy, minimal annual increase The company has lost its culture, and it’s way forward. There is zero chance of advancement. CommScope is bleeding employees with more than 20 years experience. People are terminated for no reason, jobs are moving to India, and senior management publicly acknowledges more jobs will be lost, Middle management is inexperienced and generally useless. The company has more Vice Presidents than managers or supervisors. Right now, everyone is updating their resumes and looking for a way out. Salaries are not competitive, and the insurance is horrific. International company with options for remote work No job security, poor management No clear career path Individual contributors do not get the credit they deserve. Contractors seeking permanent employment don't have a snowball's chance on a hot sidewalk of getting hired. Other than the awesome team I worked with directly, upper management completely ignored our team and didn't have our backs. Good location, great peers No chance for advancement, zero support from upper management Only thing good is the pay ..... Only thing good here is the pay ..... unless you kiss someone’s rear end ...or are a pushover .... you’ll never advance to management.....and then the management that is there in Catawba ,NC ...they’ve forgotten where they came from, meaning that they let their position go to their heads...they want to hold writing people up over their heads. ..if you breathe the wrong way you get wrote up ! And you happen to fall asleep on NIGHT SHIFT .... threats auto termination there ! Would definitely not recommend going to work here! They get the younger generation in and pay them decent money and get them stuck so they think they can’t leave because of how much they’re making. Definitely not worth the hassle and heartache of trying to work here. Glad I’m gone Pay Everything else It was fun I really enjoyed this internship. I worked on a project that actually impacted the company. We had game nights. My managers were really supportive. I learned a lot. Not a fun job. All in all this company doesn’t care about anyone your replaceable if the company is slow they will fire you to keep payroll up to par Commscope lucky I gave them 1 star if it was up to me I wouldn’t give any Good Place to work Fast paced Product launches , Good learning opportunities , good team collaboration. Experienced coworkers and must wear multiple hats in the company. Good resources Job security It used to be a good place to work with great pay The newer management there are going to run the place into the ground because they are clueless as to how things should operate to be successful. They refuse to listen to the employees that have been there for years and have to do the actual work, and know what is best. The management team is constantly changing things for the worse. Good pay No space to do the job correctly because of poor management decisions A complicated and slightly dysfunctional environment You have to make this place work for you as employees are not appreciated despite all the fine words. If you know how to maneuver through the politics you can carve out a decent career but you are on your own and have to rely on your own colleagues and your wits Pays extremely well The pay is almost unbeatable for the skill set required. Other than that, it’s an ok place to work. Management isn’t that good, but it could be worse. If you don’t mind working 12 hours on a 4 on 4 off schedule, it’s decent The pay Management 1 Thank you for taking the time to leave us your review. At CommScope, our goal is to be competitive and offer the best compensation packages for our employees. We appreciate your honest feedback and know that your review helps us improve the company. Good pay bad management Management is slowly getting worse, pay is good as are benefits 4x4 schedule is nice as well .................................. Pay Management 3 We are sorry to hear you are not as happy with the management in your location. We take employee feedback seriously and encourage you to address any future concerns with your manager or HR partner. We want to know what is working well and what could be improved. Providing more details through dedicated channels will allow us to investigate these concerns and celebrate successes. No vision where you are heading while doing your job at all Poor corporate culture and team spirit is at zero level. People just disappear from the office without farewell or any other notices. Culture is stuck somewhere in 1980s... Compensation and benefits are good No leadership at all. No cooperation b/ w different structures. 2 Sadly dysfunctional and technologically lacking 1960s manufacturing environment. I was hired to develop a manufacturing execution system (MES) application, based on an existing MS Access application in operation at 5 locations in Mexico. The application was written and documented in Spanish. I was given one employee to assist with rewriting the MES system, but this employee was busy beyond full time just supporting the existing Mexico MES locations. Management significantly underestimated the software application requirements and the labor and resources required to make the application reality and distribute it to all sites worldwide. The management ideology was non-technical, mid 1960s manufacturing with little automation and no desire to improve or implement new technology. I'm glad I was only there 10 months. International manufacturing, lots of room for improvement Mid 1960s manufacturing mindset, minimal technology, no desire to automate, improve There are worse companies After CommScope acquired the company I worked for, things went downhill. I would only characterize it now as ""ok."" Less PTO, higher deductible on health insurance, and fewer opportunities for career growth through outside webinars, seminars, etc (because they don't want to pay for them), all contribute to a less-than-stellar experience. Still, it could be worse, and I have a great manager, so I'll stick around for now. We have a new CEO now, so perhaps the overall culture will improve, we'll see. Good 401(k) match Not much vacation time Ooogly Don’t like it and don’t want to work there suck Suck suck Not good place to work No good Don’t work there Asking too much Unbelievable Annoying Bad bad bad Great Place to Work I personally had no complaints as I worked with a good group of people who looked out for each other. The company does have some older values such as a business casual dress code but they seem to have some modern ones as well such as work from home days for IT. The benefits are pretty standard as far as 401k matching, healthcare, and 3 weeks vacation. It was acutally good. My supervisor really helped us out and didnt mind teaching us. I learned the basics and then got the opportunity to learn new stuff from different departments. Family like atmosphere Good place to work, until the management decided not to care anymore which resulted in a shut down. Moving it to Mexico. Before that, it was a great place to work! Family like atmosphere Management ran it into the ground Good workplace Great people to work with my hin was clear and my assignments picking orders was always on paper not much room for error although yet mistakes can be made if not careful Don’t hang around If you start here, don’t hang around to long. Good place to learn what you can and move on. The pay is average at best, the bonuses are minimal if at all, and the healthcare benefits are terrible. Short term learning opportunity Long term career killer No room for movement They often hire from outside the company instead of promoting qualified employees that already know the job. It’s tough to stay motivated when you know there is no room to move forward in your career. Don’t Good pay short breaks and long hours to stand on your feet. Would recommend people to give it try. If you don’t get laid off it will be a miracle. Paid time off I’d lacking Productive fun place to work It was a good company to work for, the compensation and management was good. There was not a lot of opportunity to grow in Human resources department. Quarterly bonuses Unable to work from home Good work environment good work environment, the leader is attentive to the needs of employees, good communication, the company cares about the welfare of its employees A lot of overtime N/a Not a work friendly environment I found the company to be top down oriented, management was very rigid and dictatorial. While the company spoke of inclusion and fostering of ideas, it was more lip service than anything else. Highly stressful environment, very little work/life balance. Due to management's poor strategic plans, the company was floundering, people were being laid off, bonuses cut substantially, yet executives got stock options and large pay increases. Unattractive healthcare benefits, culture, work/life balance Nothing special, just average or lower Anyone rating this place 5 stars falls into one of 2 categories, honeymoon phase of employment or brownnoser and hardly works. The place has an abundance of the latter, and they tend to get the promotions and the worker bees are over loaded. If your starting out your career, it’s a good place to learn. If not, don’t waste your time unless it’s just a stopping pt to better things. The pay is good, benefits are below average, and bonuses are terrible. You can do you own research and see how much debt they carry in relationship to their revenue, and they continue to overpay the c-suite for poor results. They continue to purchase market share or non related product lines at a premium. Those with VP title are way over rated. C-suite is running this place into the ground and it amazes me the board and the shareholders have not kindly pushed them out the door. They preach good ethics and morals, but you have to practice what you preach. I could write a book, but all I can say is, don’t trust anyone and always be looking over your shoulder. Salary and learning experience Everything else Company moving to Mexico They dropped this bomb on us aug.15. That the company is closing for good. We all have different exit dates. Made us work through corona and lied and said business was booming. Now 3 months later shutting down. Fun people poor culture They close plants without any Rhyme or reason. There are supervisors and managers in positions they were unqualified for so they would never advance which does not leave any opportunity for advancement. None Terrible insurance Great Place to work Great Place to Work. Great Location. Great Pay/Benefits. The people at Commscope are very friendly and helpful. The location is close to where i live. The building has a very nice gym, a very nice cafeteria. Decent pay Job has decent pay and benefits. The management is sorry. Bad attitudes and disgruntled management that plays favoritism and disrespects most everybody else. Toxic environment. Pays extremely well The pay is almost unbeatable for the skill set required. Other than that, it’s an ok place to work. Management isn’t that good, but it could be worse. If you don’t mind working 12 hours on a 4 on 4 off schedule, it’s decent The pay Management 1 Thank you for taking the time to leave us your review. At CommScope, our goal is to be competitive and offer the best compensation packages for our employees. We appreciate your honest feedback and know that your review helps us improve the company. Unstable company The work culture is very orthodox. Management is not clear with the goal and the direction. The work is very random. You need to be super proactive to actually perform. Productive place with lots of great people While working at Commscope, I worked mainly with one Linux-based BSP SDK and was able to use that gained knowledge and apply it to a second Linux-based BSP SDK. Thank you so much for your review! We hope the knowledge and experience you gained will continue to help your career! Productivity and some fun with pool table I hope there are more internal projects instead of ODM and JDM because that way you can learn more new things everyday and keep up with new technology to improve your skiils and update your knowlegde. Nice Place to work Pleasant work environment with challanging work that is not too stressful. Nice place to work. Most enjoyable part of my job was working along side my co-workers. At work experience Very good place to work I've been there for a year and a few months. Very close to my home so the commute is convenient. Shifts are very good , career advancements could be better but other than that awesome place to work. none Are you seriously expecting me to do this to every company I worked for? This is the dumbest thing I have ever seen.If i have to do this I think I will use another company to search for jobs Ok place to work Okay place to work the culture is not as expected. Management could use some training. Older workers that have been there over 10+ years are set in their ways and are not willing to change with the times. Acceptable place to work There is a good variety of tasks and people here. Benefits are decent and work location and time off policies are excellent and flexible. There is good communication within the management team and good opportunities for movement within the company. Worse benefits ever! Cut everyones pay and unachievable goals are set. Medical benefits are ridiculously expensive unless you opt for the high deductible plans. No employee stock purchase plan or stock grants ever. Just say NO! Low pay, dubious coworkers, I'd pass on any job at CommScope Just what the review summary indicates - RUN, don't walk away from this place. If you're hired as a contract project coordinator, it will never turn into a full-time job, pay is too low, and I could not trust anyone. You're making money Low pay, unappreciated, coworkers untrustworthy, unfriendly culture Pay. It is a good place to work to provide for your family. Commscope also provides get health benefits for employees and family. Commscope allows you the opportunity to change jobs by posting them on the board. Good place to work. mainly at plant in Claremont Made mistake and walked out many years ago because of personal reason at home.. not a good choice at all... haven't found another place to work that comes close to pay and benefits yet. Shipping manager sucks !! Shipping supervisor and lead suck big time . No respect for a person well being, (literally) !! Nhihduhouovuhouvwovjvouvhoowosvbowohpihgpdivonwuhdhh Weiser Security not given us a raise Weiser Security is not giving us a raise only making $10 an hour I have been working for Weiser Security for over seven years at Commscope for almost just as long My opinion the only thing good about this place is the pay for the work Good pay pretty good work crew horrible management and leads and supervision vary poo hr management. Hard to get days off with out getting in trouble even with approval and advance warning even with pto Good workplace, terrible policies Good workplace, good pay, terribly easily to get in trouble for needing to call in and such..even with having personal time, you're still punished for needing to use it. Good site to work It’s an excellent place to work but I need more hours. I would recommend this place to anyone great employees and my ex boss was excellent. I’m looking for something similar but with more than 40 hours per week POOR benefits. Poor benefits. Sub par IT support staff. Good pay. Lack of communication. Difficult to evolve. Removed loads of benefits. Management changes often. Passive-Aggressive Behavior Permeates Management Individuals in the management team consistently set their own career interests over the interests of the company or the interests of fellow employees. This behavior takes many forms with the most common being a consistent use of passive-aggressive behavior - managers feign agreement and cooperation in face-to-face meetings when they have absolutely no intent to be cooperative in reality. Free coffee, tea, hot chocolate. Mismanagement by company leaders. N/a You work really hard but there is not much room for advancement. You see other people in the department advance within a couple of months of their start date. Pays extremely well The pay is almost unbeatable for the skill set required. Other than that, it’s an ok place to work. Management isn’t that good, but it could be worse. If you don’t mind working 12 hours on a 4 on 4 off schedule, it’s decent The pay Management 1 Thank you for taking the time to leave us your review. At CommScope, our goal is to be competitive and offer the best compensation packages for our employees. We appreciate your honest feedback and know that your review helps us improve the company. I loved my job. The biggest thing I liked about my job at Commscope was once you were trained at whatever you would be doing, they cut you loose and let you do it on your own. For the most part the management trusted the employees to get the job done. 2 Internship I completed a summer internship with CommScope, Inc in their Hickory Office. I learned a ton about the communications field. The culture was inclusive and laid back. 1 Commscope Inc. An overview of my employment with commscope would be; they're a great company to grow within to establish yourself in a working environment that pride themselves on safety, quality, and productivity. I would refer or recommend this company to anyone with intent to further themselves within the maintenance/construction field. It's a alright place to work,not a career job The job is not bad and there really is not a hard job there to do.they would do well in the area of training people completely before leaving them on their own.the place as a whole would be better if all Managers that have been there for more than a year were replaced because of showings favoritism towards people they have known for a long time that are not the best worker's Productive and good company but not enough advancement. The company has good benefits and is a company that will advance in wireless communications for the future. There in the process now of beginning there 5g experience in the next few years. cafe gratis No trabajan en equipo, el supervisor de mantenimiento no esta capacitado para ese puesto buen sueldo No existe el trabajo en equipo. Good place to work I had various jobs and traied people. They were constantly adding more responsibility and didnt want to increase pay. But overall I enjoyed my experience working their. Really nice and not stressful place to work at. The work environment was very relaxed. They prefer quality over quantity. For them, safety was priority. No one should leave the facility injured, that was what they said every day during safety meetings. Old employee No time at home with family. Job security is good. Benefits pretty good. Still high in cost for families. After been there that long just not worth it to me. Structured environment Work is fast-paced at times but overall depends on some days. Working through the agency was not a great idea and they take two years to make you permanent but most of the time they just let you go. Good Work environment Agency (Aeroteck) Great place to work Atmosphere is great, some days you work harder than others but you're never over worked. Pay is excellent with raises every 8 weeks. Management could use a little more communication but is overall great. Fun work place I enjoyed working at Commscope. I would still be there if I wasn't in group that was laid off due to the lack of work. My supervisor went out if her way to help me in all my concerns with my job. Great work atmosphere None Constant Change - never able to settle in and enjoy. The work environment is fine. Most positions can work from home except for those in roles really requiring face-to-face. We are all grown up with this subject so those that are against it are typically ignorant of the work ethics of majority. If abused, it will clearly be noticeable. Truly enjoyed Teams but moving around in company is difficult and more needs to be done with HR (in person) to help folks move around. To much ""self help"" wastes employee's time. I was not in a great position for last 1 1/2 year performing work that was not truly leveraging my background. In general, you can make decent salary at management level. Mentor ship programs are in place mainly for women which is great, not so much for men. Some mentors are not mentors. You may have better experience but need to push and prod. Hardly productive Never in my wildest dreams had I expected to be harrassed because I had to use the restroom. Unbelieveable, !! What I had to endure !! Bullied. Stared down on Job is not hard Bad supervisor Good pay. The environment is inspiring and pay is good. The educational assistance program is amazing and support from co-workers was great. The option to relocate is good. Great company to work for I've worked for the company for 20 years and saw many changes with the business. Great company to work for who rewarded your hard work. Many opportunities within the company for job growth. Worked there for twenty years. Enjoyed the work I loved working at commsxipe. I Really was wanting to change my hours and that is one thing that is hard to to. I was working second shift when I retired. Great place to work Never had any problems there. I got normal hours and great pay for only a summer temp. Any question I had was answered and I was trained to do the job in a fast and effective way. Good hours, pay and really good supervisor. Exelente ambiente de trab El trabajo muy especial bien organizado exelente instalaciones muy bien capacitado maquinaria y equipo muy actualizado Gastos medicos Ninguno great place to work It is a great place to work. The work is not hard but there is some heavy lifting. Great work schedule. Management needs to be on the same page. Management aslo needs to be equal with all employees."
ESRI, Inc.|" Good people with some challenges to sort through Great product and vision but many processes are over-engineered, and job performance isn't often clearly defined. Some departments seem like they are changing every year. Ups and Downs Working as a support analyst can be a little rough sometimes and it doesn't help that support services has such a large turnover rate. With the amount of work we do, pay isn't competitive. Benefits, banked hours, remote Lower pay, high turnover Okay Starting Job Initially seemed like a good company, but as time has gone on has become stagnant. It is very tough to advance and is a slow process. Requires several approvals and numerous interviews to possibly not be selected. Pay is low and was brought to management’s attention and nothing has been done. As an enterprise analyst, you’re required to have large skill set compared to desktop or online teams, but aren’t compensated. Good benefits but it doesn’t make up for pay. It is a good way to start your career but wouldn’t suggest as a long term career move 1 Bad Management The company is great but there is no transparency in the salary, hiring process, and management. They should spend more time and money on keeping the current workers. Esri: buyer beware After working with Esri 4+ years, it’s clear to me that they prioritize people who work more than 40 hrs/week and would be very Esri loyal. There is little sense of structure in terms of when a person is up for advancement, even though they have defined career lattices for each arena within the division. Comparative pay is lower for the industry although benefits are generally good overall. Previous employees were silenced or pushed out for wanting to make serious and needed change to the way corporate handles housing and pay. Too much of the decisions on direction are decided at the top executive level. Good option for work/life balance, but falls short in career advancement and pay Offers great work/life balance with ample opportunities for learning and personal development. In product development, you can shape the direction of your career to an extent; however, career advancement can be slow given the flat company structure. Coworkers are great for the most part, although known troublemakers are tolerated without consequences, or simply shuffled from team to team. Middle management is pulled mostly from long-time employees, regardless of leadership qualities. Company culture has declined over the past few years, with complacency setting in. This, along with below-industry pay seems to drive talented and motivated people elsewhere. Despite this, it's a good place to start your career and offers good work/life balance. Work/life balance; flexibility; learning opportunities Leadership; career development; below industry pay 4 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Overall, a very good company for people who want a stable income and are not ambitious in their career path. Good job security and no layoff because Jack is a kind guy; good medical and dental package; yearly pre-tax bonus deposited to 401K; work/life balance; inexpensive living cost in the cheap surrounding cities What is the most stressful part about working at the company? An Esri employee is paid by hours. So how to get hours from manager is critical. You can get more and easy hours if you are manager's favorite. Otherwise, your work will be miserable What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Very rare opportunity for career growth so peers' competition is low; as result, the relation among co-workers is friendly What is a typical day like for you at the company? Depending which department you are in. You are very relaxed and can spend most of your day walking around on the company's campus if you are in the core product (ArcGIS) department; you feel anxious most time to look for approved hours from your manager if you are in the professional services department. Adaptive and Harmony The management is willing to listen to staff request and make the adjustment accordingly. If you looking to learn more things, this is a good place to go with and expecting brain cracking process in this company as the product is a bit complicated (this is science). Overall, working in this company can be stressful, but a lot exposure given for you. Blessed to be part of Esri Malaysia team! Great relationships Would work there anytime. Esri has a great people who are committed to making Esri better everyday and helping its customers succeed in what they do. starting this job remotely is difficult Succeeding in this company as a support analyst is dependent on work collaboration or having prior knowledge of GIS systems. Not enough constructive criticism Great job security, although at a cost. Esri provides amazing job security. It's well known that the company doesn't do layoffs. This speaks volumes about their business model. First of all, they do well. They have secured many government contracts and worked their data into many large companies. Secondly, they advertise their stability to attract candidates. That's what brought me in there. I mean, no layoffs and a steady job until retirement for many sounds amazing. And at first, it sounded amazing to me too. With no layoffs, the company never trims the dead weight. The dead weight the company has acquired over the years sits in middle management for the most part. As a whole, the company is very behind the curve. They are the premiere GIS company, although there are many players now in their space really impacting their business. While people are passionate about GIS, they aren't very innovative when it comes to technology outside of the GIS space. So if you're a GIS person, then Esri is probably a great place to hang things up, boast about how great ArcGIS is, and count the hours until you retire. Although if you aspire to work in cutting edge technology and surround yourself with people that are looking to do innovative things, then I'd think twice before signing up there. They move very very slow. Like a snail. Lots of meetings, then more meetings, then missing deadlines. If you're lazy, then it's a great place for you. I personally found this environment torture, and after a few years, I couldn't wait to get away and start doing some good work again. Anyhow - the Esri mission is Stability. They don't lay people off. Out of touch upper management, lazy people, lots of incompetence, and generally a very slow pace, and Redlands. Poor Communication/HR/Modernization Esri is a very successful company, that offers a lot of job stability. However, healthcare benefits should not justify the low pay to most of the employees. Esri seems to be stuck in the 80's and justifies its compensation based on benefits. Additionally, if the company needs to look to restructure and work on one department they truly need help in HR. Esri HR is not ethical, helpful, communicative, and truly is a huge underlying cause for employees leaving and not wanting to transfer internally. Good place to learn Esri is a good place to start your career in IT. There are respectful employees so you get treated well. It is easy to move to other teams and you get opportunities to do that. Not equal opportunity employer This company from ownership down think poorly of non college educated staff. It is known that non exempt staff are not valued. Have given exempt staff FULL FLEXIBLE SCHEDULES and communicated for 2yrs this would be for everyone until recently. They are not giving and flexibility or hybrid schedules to non exempt staff and are having a mass exodus over it but hasnt even given them pause to reconsider. Hundreds of employees that have been with company for 10+ years are being treated so poorly and extremely under paid. Do not recommend this company. Not what you think. The benefits are great but they hold it over you once you relocate to area and pay extremely low. People openly talk politics and HR does not protect people of different opinions. Enjoyable work Discrimination, not progressive in improving processes Great place to work - amazing culture truly embodying work / life harmony, diversity and inclusion - developing incredible cutting edge technology software products - amazing company to work for Great place to learn twch skills Awesome place to work and learn tech skills for new grads. There is a lot to learn and everyone is helpful. If you enjoy helping others and troubleshooting this is for you Tech skills, work atmosphere Too many cases, training too short A very inclusive environment that encourages innovation It's a great company. Innovative, creative, and inclusive. The campus also has an aesthetic that encourages one to find new solutions, to create new ideas, and think outside of the box. Great cafe on campus No advancement if you don't have a degree Overall, a good place If you value stability over change and security over frequent advancement, then Esri is a great place to work. If you are looking for a fast-paced, agile work environment, you may be disappointed. With a very conservative financial approach and slow-moving decision making processes, Esri is great for employees looking to onboard and spend considerable time in their hired positions. Workplace culture is nicely middle-of-the-road, neither dogmatic nor ignored. Most staff are friendly and helpful. Good healthcare plan with no monthly employee premium. May be too slow moving for those looking to advance quickly. Collaboration Esri prides itself on teams working together to achieve their goals. Like with any company, once you become accustomed to the way things work, it becomes easier to communicate with other departments and build up your professional and personal skills. A great place to work A great place to work if you land the role you want. You can learn to your heart's content. Salary is ok and benefits are good. You can develop your career in different direction. Great working atmosphere; access to latest GIS knowledge; Career advancement; Good benefits Salary is industry standard (not really a con) Amazing people making a difference together! Esri is the best place I have ever worked and I have been in the Geospatial industry for a very long time. I have never worked anywhere that had so many intelligent people with great senses of humor in one place. The Pacific Northwest team is the best! Good people with some challenges to sort through Great product and vision but many processes are over-engineered, and job performance isn't often clearly defined. Some departments seem like they are changing every year. Great place for a career This is absolutely a fantastic organization for the rest of my career. This company takes care of its employees providing fair pay and adequate time off. Pay, vacation Amazinging superior environment with many v. smart people - supportive colleagues - great management I spent an interval of time at this extraordinary company - learned so much every day - was given opportunity for advancements tremendously sound leadership ability to hone skills in an exceptionally positive environment - Esri is a suburb corporate citizen Best place I’ve ever worked! Esri is by far one of the best places I’ve ever worked. Management is extremely supportive and clearly wants to see their employees succeed. Esri has a clear mission to help change the world through advancing spatial science, and they are doing a great job of it. Paid hourly, but still exempt. Earning potential is larger then 40 hours. None so far Controlling senior management It’s difficult to get things done effectively and efficiently. There were inept senior leaders who did not create processes that made it clear how to get things done. Zero creativity. All about repeating what had been done before — no matter how ineffective it was. Ten approvals just to buy a customer lunch. Incredible lack of trust in the people they hire. The micromanagement was intense. High Turnover My experience here was unfortunately bad and felt obligated to share my experience as it is all too common. During my time at ESRI, I had no support from management as my supervisor intimidated and belittled me everyday. I was told I disposable daily, it got so bad I didn't know if Id get paid for a full day work. I was told from HR & management to either take it or leave. Management doesn't care about your career aspirations and there is little to any movement/promotions. There is high turn over, don't expect to work here and for things to be fair. Interns are paid more than those with more experience. Non-exempt employees are treated as second class. Working hard isn't good enough here to make it. The company has a reputation for ""spitting out"" those who don't quite fit. I've spoken to many people around the community who have had similar negative experiences. Most people do not end up making it long term, so don't be fooled by the fact that people have worked there for years. If you end up working here know that you are taking a risk, it could possibly and will most likely NOT work. I would consider this company to be more of a bridge job rather than a career. The job itself was easy but the culture was one of complaints, gossip, and unfriendly colleagues. It sucked the life out of many people and it affected their performance/moral. Inconsistent and malicious management/supervisors doesn't allow you to focus on your craft. Leaving this company was the best decision I could of made. Avoid this company due to the fact that it has HIGH turnover, malicious management, low pay, Poor experience Worked in one of ""Support Centres"". Had to leave it much earlier. Key points: 1. All management is mostly of one race and mentality, there is no diversity whatsoever 2. Roads are not open to smart, but to loyal people with no backbone 3. So called ""leads"" are in fact mini-directors, they lead nothing apart from tucking people back in the line 4. Caste society. Double-speaking, double and triple-dealing mass, which covers up for one another and never progresses because of that. Very narrow-minded people. 5. Rude and often incompetent ""leaders"", ""trainers"". 6. Misleading and even threatening management which has no idea what GIS is. 7. Terrible treatment in overall. Place is soaked in lies, manipulations and gossips. Tons of politics. Everyone who is upper is never accountable. 8. Management does not care about anything as long as workers are loyal and useful. One can drink beer and play Fortnite at work, second would be fired in 24 hours if dares to ask for days off to take care of their child. 9. Meaningless to say, but all the rules are applied selectively. It depends on how much one can lick. free lunches management Worked at ESRI for 24 years from 1984. I would not recommend this company other than to use it as a jump start to somewhere better. Believe, there are way better places to forward your career. Everyone thinks that Jack Dangermonds company is the best. In the 1980's and 90's it was a great place to work. But as soon as they had TWO HR departments monitoring your email calling you in to HR because it too more than 15 minutes to respond while you were at lunch or in the bathroom. That is when I left after 24 years. I Have my own business now and love it. I have to say it has been very tough since March 2020. But we are all suffering from the same thing. no not really Productive Productive and efficient work environment. A typical day at work was repetitive and balanced. The workplace culture was sufficient. The hardest part of the job was finding coverage for the front desk. Friendly work environment both demands and rewards adaptability. The hardest part of the job was simply settling into the environment and learning the new tools. After that, I was set to work. I would experience problems and difficulties with the projects, but I always had someone else's expertise to rely on. After a while, others would even come to me for help on their project. I was always learning new things (even an entirely new programming language on the spot), so there wasn't any shortage of challenge, but even during my rougher patches where I struggled more than I'd liked, I still felt like an appreciated part of the team. The only complaint about the job was the commute time (40 mins there, 50 mins back), but that was primarily a personal problem. Good culture, wide variety of challenges Commute time Great products and people. Esri is a leader in the industry not only because it started so long ago, but because as a privately owned company, it reinvests profits back into it's people, products and services. There is always a clear mission to help people understand their world with the technology. Opportunity for Professional Growth Esri provides many opportunities for personal and professional growth. You are given ample training opportunities to define your own direction and contribution to the the team / organization. You are free to do what you want Worked at Esri ~3 years. A typical day is really dependent on you. I spend a lot of time researching and learning in addition to normal job responsibilities. Management is very hands off. Very open culture. Most frustrating part are difficult employees who have been here forever and are just coasting. loved this environment. I was allowed to plan multiple extra curriculum activities that brought the team closer. A typical day at Esri would be exciting as i got the chance to make my day whatever it needed to be above and beyond my normal work duties. Be it a candy bar station, fresh flowers or a birthday celebration it was always something to bring a lighter part of these heavy hitters day. Management was great towards these activities, but unfortunately, not towards promoting us. Management was like our friend but was not secure enough in their position to make things happen for their staff. This would be the hardest part of the job. As I watched so many educated and skilled young people stay on the same level for so long. But what I will remember most of Esri is the awesome support I received from Everyone when my husband got sick and during his last 2 1/2 years of life Esri was there for me like no other. I never was made to feel bad about time off and my team did everything they would to ensure my work continued in my absence. I will never forget... Enjoyed my time with ESRI The ESRI culture is a strong one of individual accountability and success. One big thing to note for sales positions is that this is a non-commission sales organization. They pay fairly, but the big upside swings are not available. Company stuck in the past Lot of old school programmers who bog down the company. They keep hearkening back to past and show little respect for new employees. I see a lot of toxic shouting matches and hazing which new employees have to endure. Also a lot of rules such as vacation hours and remote work are applied selectively. Old employees are on vacation but dont use their hours, because selective bias+magic. Being an industry leader does not guarantee the same forever. Drive long time toxic employees out. Challenging Culture Esri software is by far the best GIS software on the market unfortunately it is a very difficult culture to work in. The organization is flat and advancement is only provided to a select few of inner circle of managers. Partnering with Esri is also very difficult. The Partners often complain about the length of time it takes to achieve closure on issues and opportunities due to the bureaucracy at the corporate level Good work-life balance Beatiful working environments and lots of independent office cells. Employees can trade extra working time for vacations. I guess that’s why the salary is not that high. I don't recommend to people I care about I didn't feel respected, or valued after working there for a long time. Career advancement was impossible, no help by managers or HR. I could never trust my direct managers. Esri has this, ""need to have a degree to work here"" mentality so this place is filled with, new grads, or old experienced professionals. Because of that, you have a whole lot of spoon fed arrogant people with no creativity, lack of social skills, vision, life experience, passion or care about what they really want to do with their lives. If you are creative, fun, have true passion for what you do, got your degree by really working for it, go somewhere fun like NBC Universal, Disney, Google, places like that. Fair warned. It was fine I would rather not comment on my time there but to be honest I think the company is growing every day and it's still being run with a small business mentality. That can be good socially, but also make's it very hard to grow professionally. What I learned As a Jr. Systems admin, I got to learn a lot of new things from my Colleagues. I also learned some better ways of performing tasks that I had existing knowledge of in a much quicker way Good people with some challenges to sort through Great product and vision but many processes are over-engineered, and job performance isn't often clearly defined. Some departments seem like they are changing every year. Winds of change are blowing at Esri Average pay, terrific benefits package. Sales organization can be stressful despite non-commissioned sales force; experiences vary considerably by manager. Markedly different experiences and work-life balance across divisions. Little to no promotional opportunities in the remote offices. Management bottlenecks make it hard to get business done. Work is underway to modernize much of Esri in IT and Bus Dev for example, more needs to be done as other Bus units seem stuck decades behind. Company culture shifting with growth; businesslike climate is being replaced with a more social atmosphere - can be frustrating to observe some enjoy the levity while seasoned staff carry the load. 3 1 Great place to work Esri cares about its employees and its customers. Everyone is passionate and mission focused. The CEO and founder has integrity and is a good organizational leader. 1 Great job with amazing benefits Great people, amazing support team in place and the benefits that are provided are so amazing. The work environment is very team oriented...great place to work. Great Place but Management is a bit too stuck in the past Great place to work hours are not bad, the pay is okay, and benefits are great, however (I can't speak entirely for Esri) I guess I just got unlucky to be placed in a really strict management and work environment. Some people you may run across are a tad bit passive but that just how they are. They are definitely experiencing a HUGE age gap (not a lot of young folks) and I just feel like it's because of management. They are really stuck in the past and things like ""warming the seat"" are somethings you have to get use to. Although it's a tech company just beware of how traditional management is. On my way out I have spent many hours learning new skills, made myself clear to management and HR about what my passions are, and what I want to do in the future. I certified myself in the new skill, and continued educating myself by attending school and made sure I was learning skills to help my current department and future position. This all went nowhere. I felt management and HR turned the other way, never encouraged and applauded my non-stop drive to learn and advance. I felt esri would rather hire peon interns and outsiders instead of focusing on the people that have dedicated themselves long term. I WAS happy go lucky, excited to advance and impress my colleagues, and be awesome for esri. Instead, with the constant cold shoulders of my leaders that enjoys the focus on minute failings, my goals were to learn what I need to learn, educate myself, and hash out of esri and never turn back. I am very keen, educated, fun, and drive to succeed. The company that knows how to recognize this will be extremely, and pleasantly happy. Great place to work with great benefits Being a worldwide company, it was an exciting place to work. I was able to see parts of world I never would visited and work with great people. Great accessibility to different cultures. A Typical Day at Work Clerical work with review of the paperwork. Additional review followed by clerical work. Seldom any interaction with the outside world. This is a government contractor. Flexible Hours Inexperienced Management Fun work environment and great to learn new skills I enjoyed my time at Esri. I got to learn many new GIS skills that I would not have anywhere else. The people are great to work with and will always help you. Do not recommend Esri My experience at Esri was very negative. I often had very little work during the week to do and when I brought this to the attention of my supervisor, he retaliated. When I took a medical leave of absence, he tanked my review and took away my work. When I returned after months of working with HR to resolve the differences between myself and my supervisor, I was asked to resign. When I refused to resign, they came back with a very small severance package to entice me to walk away amicably. Opportunity to travel and learn GIS software Poor management and HR practices. laidback environment for most roles. Job security Very low pay in the industry. New hires even fresh grad got paid more than expirenced employees. No room for career advancements too. They are very good in sponsoring H1b visa and green card for international employees. If you have other job offers, do not take this one. My team is famous to grow algorithm programmers for other big tech companies which is sad. Flexible hours Low pay Fun workplace and unique work At the icon and design division, we were given unique projects to design for different clients within Esri and also develop products to better the company in general. I learned how to utilize Illustrator to its full potential and tested my limits in problem-solving while learning it. The culture is overall welcoming and encouraging, getting help and critique from other departments and creators are encouraged, which was the most enjoyable aspect of the internship. The most difficult part was working without tools that full-time employees had access to, but in the end, the challenge helped me learn even more. The schedule is very customizable to work with commuting and other events later or earlier in the day. Throughout a work day, I'd work on my assigned project and do check-ins regularly with my project leaders to make sure my designs were on schedule and within the guidelines. Coworkers, projects, scheduling Frequent project changes Team work atmosphere One of the hardest most demanding projects that i have worked but the experience was priceless. During a flood like harvey caused the entire region was in chaos and the people treated us like heroes Paid for food and lodging Some workers and staff were in experienced Sales associate A typical day involves fielding telephone calls, producing quotes, and providing information to clients about business-to-business software. Workplace culture is relaxed and the management hierarchy is perceived to be flat (no org charts). The company hires former government employees to build their sales contacts and offers no compensation for increased software sales. Esri Experience Overall Esri is a great company to work for that encourages all employees to learn and use their products to better serve their customer base and find innovative solutions. Travel reimbursement, banked hours, great benefits Great company with a horrible sales channel Great company with a solid mission to be a source for good in the world. However the internal conflicts between product leaders, and a long history or bad marketing left them struggling to be accessible to a larger audience. The company has much much much smaller footprint than they deserve. Great mission, Great people too self-centered, lateral moves almost impossible Avoid this Company Very negative experience with this company. Non-exempt staff are treated poorly and work/life balance is only for exempt employees. Two classes of employees here. Management do not trust staff and over-control minutia. They are out-of-touch with modern work practices and make it difficult to get simple things done. Dead-end company. Free coffee Management Great place to work I really enjoy my work here at Esri. There is a lot that the employees do to create a wonderful culture in and out of the office. The campus is beautiful and makes coming to work in the morning that much more enjoyable. Exellent workplace with challenging projects Open workspace Plenty of meeting spaces Top of the line equipment Multiple monitors Management cares about personal development Paid hourly Generous Vacation time Bank Hours Awesome collegues, challenging projects, dev growth Cant think of any Good Benefits & Job Security Low advancement opportunity and poor overall management by senior staff (some nepotism). Support team is OK but benefits are good especially healthcare. Great place to work Great place to work Great co-workers and management Great Life-work balance Great Benefit Great Campus Surrounded by smart people Great workplace culture Less young people Good people with some challenges to sort through Great product and vision but many processes are over-engineered, and job performance isn't often clearly defined. Some departments seem like they are changing every year. Cool place to work I was an intern during the summer. I had the best time in my career where I was able to meet new people from varied backgrounds, learn about what they do and also know if I have a career in their team(most important). Awesome colleagues who motivates you to suceed HR decisions take time 1 Excellent work environment but low salary and challenges to advancement The work environment could not be better at ESRI. However, I began working for them as an intern and, while hired on full-time, was always considered to be the intern and had to fight extra hard to receive adequate salary. 4 Place to settle in at for a career and grow Esri is still privately held by the husband/wife team who started the company in 1969. To really grow it to the level of Google/Microsoft,/Amazon, etc...., they need to share the wealth in some way other than what they are doing now, to retain their employees better. Need more company (paid) food places a la Google None Poor Mgmt, Low Pay, Great Colleagues I enjoyed most of my time at Esri. It was my first job out of tech school and I couldn't have been more excited to be working for the industry leader in GIS. In support, there a couple of different shifts to choose from, which meant I could opt to work from 7, so I could leave earlier in the afternoon. I learned way more in my 2 years as a support analyst there than I would have with any other organization. Dealing with clients in all states of mind was fantastic, I learned soft skills, like patience and compassion, which I have been able to take with me and use throughout my career. Technically, I became very resourceful and technically savvy, learning to think and talk on my feet, digging up answers without losing the client's confidence. The biggest issue I had was the way the advancement worked. In order to apply for an internal position, be it within your current department or in another department, you need to have your managers permission. This leaves a lot up to subjectivity - if you are great at your job, they might want to impede your professional progress, so as not to lose you, if they like someone else better, they might sign off on their application, and not yours. These types of things happened often and made the environment less than pleasant for those affected. Managers were often promoted by way cronyism or nepotism, and not always leadership qualities and skills. As an entry level position, the pay was OK, but not really good. Increases are based on ""merit,"" which is determined by your manager. Sick, Bereavement and Vacation time available On-site cafe, benefits, great entry-level position Poor advancement structure, compensation packages not great, Management not properly trained Good benefits, good compensation but stressful environment Benefits to working at Esri, on site cafeteria with great daily selections and specials. No cost health insurance for not only employee but dependents as well. On site workout facilities and casual dress work environment. Cons, no direction from management, extremely stressful work environment. Good Opportunity for Work Experience Overall, a great software company with amazing vision, brilliant staff, excellent benefits, discounts for local businesses, and opportunities to network with various industries. The company culture and attire at Esri Redlands headquarters is business casual. The hardest part of the job was maintaining a healthy work-life balance when management is determined to continually obtain the best results from staff, with little to no reward of any verbal or written recognition, acknowledgement, advancement opportunities, title or financial promotions, etc. On-site company gourmet cafe, fitness center & business casual culture Management reluctant to internally invest in & develop their staff in a clear career path Laid back workplace Great company to work if you are interested in making money, but don't care much about moving up in the organization. No discernible way that decisions are made, so you can't have an impact on what you are going to do next. Extremely inefficient internal communication between functional groups, no career growth-paths, but you can learn on your own a lot. flexible work hours, benefits boring and repetitive work Benefits good, poor management Esri is a small company that is suffering from growing pains. It wants to be large, but does not have sufficient infrastructure to move to the next level. Technology and market leadership are important, but they do not invest in their people or promotion opportunities. Plan to stay in the SAME role even if you are ready for more challenges. free coffee, flexible schedule, some working from home No advancement, Good old boy mentality, nepotism Great place to work I've learned to build on my communication and collaboration skills in a world class company. A typical day in my position is high volume of customer requests via phone, chat and email for many departments in the company, including but not limited to corporate reception, customer service, and technical support services. Esri Reception receives tens of thousands of calls per month and has been recognized for ensuring customer satisfaction, speed and accuracy in the routing of technical support calls. great benefits highly competitive cororate culture Friendly and productive environment, encourages learning new things. Got to learn a lot about Coded UI and MVVM automated tests, and about different standards or procedures followed during a SDLC. A typical day at work would start off with a scrum meeting where each member discusses what his/her plan of action for the day is or if they are having any roadblocks other teammates would suggest possible solutions. It is a great place to work at. Everyone is passionate about their work and is always ready to help. The overall environment is one that nurtures learning. Excellent Company, fun work environment, great opportunity to make a difference I interned at Esri and one thing I can say for certain, you will fall in love with the work they do and how they do it. I got the chance to work on my own ideas during my internships and mentor/managers will go a step further to help/teach you. I can't think of any cons Overall great place The best place for a geographer to work! Sometimes a little workload heavy, but that is to be expected with any company. Everyone loves coming to work. They treat employees wonderfully. Productive, yet laid-back workplace Esri is a tight-knit company, known the world over for its geographic information system (GIS) development and applications. The CEO is very active at Esri's Redlands HQ, and is very involved with the staff. The atmosphere is ""professional casual"", at least in the information technology building where I worked. Break and lunch times were fairly lax, and a typical day would usually involve mixing meetings, busywork alone, and breaks. Despite the laid-back atmosphere, tasks and projects are still generally completed on time and according to specifications. Management was particularly excellent at Esri. Since it's a relatively small company, managers know each other very well even between departments on different sides of the campus. Generally, everyone will make time to accommodate you if there are any questions you need answered. Management in my group was excellent, and made very good progress on scheduling between team members and allocating enough workforce to complete projects. However, there is still overtime expected of staff here, which I believe is a fair trade for the relaxed atmosphere this workplace gives. If you are looking just to reduce your work hours, this company may not be for you. Redlands is only accessible using the I-10 freeway, which means that it shares a lot of commute space with people going to and from Los Angeles. Because of this, the commute tends to be pretty bad. Cafe on campus, relaxed atmosphere Bad commute Awesome Great company, I've enjoyed my time here. My co-workers are very professional and make working here a pleasure. I would highly recommend this organization. Aministrative Assistant Assisted Contract managers with their work. Created files and kept them updated. Not very challenging, I like to grow in a position. Great company Not enough work Good work-life balance Good work-life balance, Loyal employees, management been around for ever. Small town luxuries, away from the big city traffic. Highly productive campus like environment that encourages innovation Everyday is like a new day with different challenges and reason to live the day to its fullest. A place with a pool of supportive associates, mentors ever willing to help and encouraging you for success in your projects and assignments. Good training Great place to work. Tons of very intelligent and helpful colleagues. A typical day at work is either me teaching a class, researching new technology, or ramping on a new course to teach in the future. Free healthcare Unable to work from home Great company and work experience but poor work environment I worked for Esri a little over 8 years and loved the work that I performed which covered a broad range of job duties and special projects so I was never bored. There were multiple learning opportunities with the companies continued grow in the international market. The hours were always long and stressful; there was no such thing as a 40 hour work week as our department was always short staffed. Depending on the department and/or the supervisor you work for, there may be flexible schedules which helps ease burnout in the short term. Unfortunately there are no common rules for how each department is ran throughout the company which makes it feel like each department is its own unit and not a part of a team. The inconsistences in management style, lack of follow up (communication), teamwork, equipment and software needs being met and limited technical support leads to moral issues and a stressful work environment overall. Management is given to individuals based upon who you are friends with rather than skills. Many of the managers have not been trained and it shows. Its not uncommon to have employee's seek assistance with work related issues including hostile work environment, stress and ergonomics issues. Instead of receiving assistance you are either ignored or find yourself under scrutiny by the Human Resource Department as if you did something wrong. HR does not protect you from retaliation when you do seek help so most people end up leaving the company rather than continue working under such conditions which is too bad because the company and the work itself Great work experience and learning opportunities Hostile work enviornment Amazing 20 years of my life! Very busy with phones, emails, and chats. Interactions with customers was about 100 per day. Learned several new CRM's. Management was decent. Co-workers were the best of the best Hardest part of my job was dealing with upset customers which was on a daily basis. Best part of my job was feeling like I was part of a family. Good people with some challenges to sort through Great product and vision but many processes are over-engineered, and job performance isn't often clearly defined. Some departments seem like they are changing every year. IT company in a small town This is the only IT company Redlands which is a quite town. There is no competition and the only other large employer is Loma Linda Hospital. Ability to learn new technologies to accomplish work. Flat management structure and little advancement. 15 2 World leader in GIS I have loved working for Esri. There is great room for professional and person growth here. The work is fun and challenging. Great environment to work and learn in. Lack of flexibility in work locations. 3 12 Nice place to work, not sold on the compensation It would not be fair of me to provide a review of this business because each department is run independently and there are many pros and cons to each. Overall, its a great place to work. They have a tendency to pay on the lower end of the market. Lots to Learn Challenging Culture I had challenges with the company culture. Senior Management has been at this company forever. What Esri needs is a dose of external Senior Management and less centralized decision making. Overall a very good company. Great place to learn. Nice people. Relaxed atmosphere. Beautiful campus. Never gone through layoffs. People stay there for ever. Horrible management Before being hired was unaware it was a temp to hire position until offered the job. Management dragged me along telling to do things so I can get hired on permanently. Did everything I was told to do by management and more. When time came around my temp position was extended. Then when it came around again I was let go and management didn't have the guts to tell me themselves. I was called and told by the temp agency. I was always on time and worked any overtime needed. Did everything and more that was asked of me. Management is a joke Good owner horrible management. low compensation Great workplace for meaningful work that is highly technical in nature Esri is a great company for those seeking to do meaningful things that affect society and the environment using technology. The company has a relaxed, collegial atmosphere and treats it employees well. Highly interesting work, social impact, technology and job security Flat management hierarchy so advancement is slow A very structured workplace The benefits far outweighed the negatives with Esri. As a User Conference Clerk, I learned a great deal about what it takes to plan an event. And while I had an integral part at making sure this conference went off without a hitch, it hardly felt as stressful as I initially imagined. My meticulous organizational skills helped keep my plate from seeming full and enabled me to learn a great deal about trade shows and events I shouldn't have had any part of. Overall, while management did very little to help me succeed once my duties were finished, I still value the structure and diligence the events department relies upon in order to be successful. Desk job Amazing business plan While Esri provides an amazing buisness plan the execution of it all leaves a bit to be desired. Great on campus cafe, good benefits, annual pay increase minimal advancement from within the company esri esri is the leader in gis. It is a good company if gis and spatial tech are your calling. Otherwise, you might be better served to come here for an internship and find a company with domain expertise and/or specialty. growing growing Stable company to work with 1. stable 2. Friendly working environment 3. Flat structure, few promotion oppotunities Great Company Volunteer Work, working with coaching people with different need, and office work Helping People Volunteer work Good Flexible hours less compensation good benefits and laidback environment good pretty good company. good environment, culture, coworkers. Best company to work for Great people, pretty laid back for a company of several thousand people. Really loved my time there. Mostly positive environment, encouraging team building, and requires strong employee workmanship In management here for nearly 7 years, I enjoyed the interaction I had with my team. We were a very strong team, meeting weekly to review our goals and expectations, discuss any challenges, and address any issues at hand. The work was difficult but we got through every challenge presented to us. We worked with international distributors so we needed to be aware of cultural differences and often times language barriers. I held my team to high standards and they were always aware of my expectations - and they were such a great team, they made my job so easy. I was very proud to say I was their manager, and one HR representative told me I did more for my team as a team builder than any other manager on campus. I just wanted to encourage them to be the best they could be so they could move on and be more than account managers. So many of them were superstars! very flexible hours, employee centric, strong employee moral, 2000 employees on campus and many knew each other advancement was slow for those wanting to move up and salaries could have been better. ESRI is a great concept company but.... ESRI does a lot for the community, state, country and world. But they are way off target with base salaries and there is very limited room for advancement. They do support education and have a great benefits package but salary for the non management positions are about 45% below industry. I have been working in my industry for over 10 years and this is the first time in an hourly position. It is difficult to be effective when bound by the time clock. good benefits. owners are generous and down to earth. no advancement. ESRI is a weak company that suffers from exceptionally poor leadership at the corporate level. ESRI was once the crown jewel of the inland empire. Unfortunately, an influx of 'horrible bosses' over the course of the last few years has effectively ruined a once great company. Since it is a privately held company, corporate can spew whatever stories they want to the industry media outlets. The company seems to hire only senior-level positions. All other positions are filled with temporary staff or contractors. This allows ESRI to avoid having to provide benefits to these folks. Also, after about 6-months on the job, an HR representative will either smile and kick you out the door, or tell you what your new job title is so they can reset the clock for another 6-months of work with no benefits. I've worked very hard for almost 17-years at this company. I've seen good times and bad times - but it has now become unbearable. Worked there too long ago to review fairly Worked there too long ago to review comprehensively, can say the culture is good, but has a reputation for not paying well Great company and people ESRI is a wonderful place to work. I often wonder why I left. Their idealistic culture isn't just a front; the company is full of people who really seem to care about the problems people are working on with GIS. Even though they are not that hard-nosed in a business sense, they are the market leader in GIS products. The only thing is that the pay seems to be just fair. I doubt you'll get your biggest salary offer from ESRI, you'll work here for the intangibles."
North Atlantic Industries, Inc| Small company feel, good people Small company feel, good people, lots of potential. Big internship program, company runs lean, new building, average benefits. Flexible hours/work from home. Not fun Very cheap to pay its workers but brag of exeptional financial goals met everyday ,managment overworks employees but they do buy you icecream occasionally None All you can think of Management is horrible All I have to say is the company overall is a great company but management isn’t. they have obvious favorites. If they don’t like you they will treat you disrespectfully. And specifically the SMT Area management. Do not recommend you to work in this side of the company. My manager was a bully. Not a good environment for me. Productive workplace with a great staff As an intern, expect to regularly check in with your supervisor and collaborate on meaningful projects. Software interns work close in proximity which allowed for us to collaborate and help on each others projects as well. Free intern events 15/hr pay Innovative and growing high-tech company North Atlantic is a cutting-edge technology company. There is rarely a day that is the same and their is never a day you can say is boring. There are new products coming out constantly and the associated efforts to test and integrate these products are quite challenging. The culture is very team oriented and everyone works well together to meet the program commitments. There is ample opportunities to learn new technologies and skills. A person is really only limited by their desire to grow. Great company, great people North Atlantic Industries is a great private company with a tremendous potential. Technology oriented, manufacturing innovative products, offering really good opportunities for design and manufacturing engineers. This company is a Long Island manufacturer with state of the art manufacturing facilities. I felt appreciated from the first to the last day, people are great and I was happy to be part of the team. I've worked a lot and I've learned a lot. Thank you NAI! Job security, Company picnic, Christmas party, yearly bonus, Christmas company paid break. Only 6 varieties of free coffee. Really fast paced company I really liked working here. If you really want to see electrical engineering in action with digital circuits and all...here's where it's at. extremely talented people. Productive and relaxed work environment - My boss was great. He assigned projects that aligned with my interests yet contributed value to the company - Also there were a few fun free food events Interesting projects, free food events Burnt electronics smell in office Very disorganized and dishonest 1st off North Atlantic claims to sell ROHS compliant products. If a customer did a little digging into their products they will quickly realize many units are actually not ROHS compliant. No real HR department and so if an employee has an issue there is no opportunities to discuss the situation. Constant disagreements between managers makes an uncomfortable work environment and leaves employees guessing about tasks and direction. close to home No real HR department. Mangers are allowed to be disrespectful to employees. Good work environment Collaborative work environment. Open to hiring many interns to help students gain experience, which is awesome. Plenty of room to learn and gain valued experience as an intern. Interesting place to work The main project worked on at North Atlantic was a teleprinter being developed for the US Navy. This led to interesting field trips and meetings in Washington and West Virginia Exciting Company That in a Fast Paced and Growing Industry I have learned a wide range of skills from design to manufacturing, product procurement, inventory management, customer support, quality control, and project management. Multiple Projects Working Remotely and Lack of Advancement It was an average place to work, with a CEO who cared about his employees It was family oriented,I was able to cross train in other areas,management was typical, management came in occasionally to see how we were progressing on each of our jobs.workplace was nice,there really were no hard parts of the job.We were capable of moving around to get some exercise so we were not uncomfortable. We had good 48 hours of sick time and 2 weeks plus vacation time. I learned more about the potting part of the job along with why things were potted and not.WE also were able to work together on certain jobs.The company had picnics and Christmas parties The reviews and raises were ok. 45 minute breaks Healthcare was expensive Good company to work for I've been working there for a little bit over 15 years and I really enjoyed working there. As long as you're comfortable at what you're working on, they really let you work at your own pace. I also enjoyed the experience of working with the test engineers. Overall I would recommend this company to anybody. Christmas party, summer picnic... The GM Very friendly environment As a testing intern my typical day consists of watching a testing senior test various modules or assisting in some way. Only on occasion I will actually get to test something on my own. NAI uses it's own software to test their tech, and at first it is very intimidating and it will take quite some time to become familiar with it. The lab is very clean. The staff is friendly. clean lab, friendly staff the snack machine ate my dollar People don't waste your time I hate this company and any departments any supervisor they don't have any education poor management and descriminatio Close home Poor management and no HR President of the company is a very down to earth man that seems to care for his employees. The president of this company is a very down to earth person and seems to care for his workers. However he has put to much faith in others to run a company that he took years to build. There is no job security if you don't agree with the politics of management. The manufacturing family from the office workers to the manufacturing floor is made up of many good people that as of late, agree with my feelings but in order to keep their positions remain silent. The medical, ins., benefits here are one of the many perks along with the Christmas shut down, summer hours and thanksgiving shopping cards. Christmas shut down, summer hours and thanksgiving shopping cards TheThere is no job security if you don't agree with the politics of management.

Giving a lot of opportunity for growth. good benefits, good pay, good people Head of production Poorly Managed Company There is in-fighting between partners and middle management. Eventually two operations people ended up running an engineering company. Many people have walked out from frustration and harassment. Close to home Management in-fighting.

Great learning experience Good place to learn about embedded systems, manager is helpful and workers are great 1 5 Engineering company run by CM/SMT operators When the CEO was sold on two yo-yos that know nothing about business, and have a reputation for destroying companies, the paranoia and backstabbing between upper management began. You can read other reviews about this place, management there has no respect for it's employees. Another company taking advantage of a poor job market. This place would loose ALL of it's talent in a different economy! Although my immediate supervisor was technically inclined, he provides no support to his staff, he feared for his job. If you do have a reason to interview there, know in advance that the long-time HR Generalist is incompetent, ask a lot of questions. Close to home for me No advancement, no support from immeadiate supervisor. 6 3 Serious work, rewarding, good benefits Serious work, rewarding, good benefits. Casual dress environment. Growing company. Great work environment I really enjoyed working for this company. As long as you did your work and put 100% effort into it than their would be no stress Challenging and rewarding Pay was not great, but I learned a lot; this being my first job out of school.

CNH Industrial|" Quality company to work for Would definitely recommend working for this company. Training is on point, equipment is provided, and tasks are not unreasonable. Given ample opportunity to meet metrics goals. Equipment provided Repetitive work 4 6 Was good at first Enjoyed working there when it was Miller St. Nazianz. As soon as CNH took over they had a large layoff. The Plant Manager at the time was great. Not sure if he is still there. Quality employees Paid reasonably, but lied to about various things in interview. Expected to work unsafely. People on the floor are good to work with but management and human resources does nothing for the employees. 2 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Coworkers were great. The pressure of the environment tends to aid in supporting each other. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Every salary person is working with a workload of atlease 2 people, if not more. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? High pressure and high stress. This may of changed with a change in WCM focus but the demand of continuous improvement in addition with regular job. The audits are every 6 mouths and there seemed to be no standard with the auditors, so it was difficult to prep and try to gear to an individual's preference instead of set rules. What is a typical day like for you at the company? 50 hour work week at a minimum to keep up with the work required. CNH showed no interest in work-life balance. Also no support in professional development unless it was free or cheap. Company seemed to has a 2 to 3 year turnover rate for salary factory employees but little was done to improve that during my time there. It’s not bad except all the bull you have to deal with Every day I come in here I hate myself a little more and proceed to sue inside the management is terrible and the coworkers for the most part are worse 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? No comment What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Being treated like a carpet you get walked on by co workers. And your always overworked,over looked for a position you know your qualified for. and under paid. And it leaves a guy wondering why What is the work environment and culture like at the company? The work environment is a hostile one. What is a typical day like for you at the company? No comment Not good You have to be related to upper management to have any chance advancement. Hopefully a relative sucked its way to the top before. Sad but true! Upper management doesn’t even know how parts are made!!! Insurance Not sucking to reach goals Poor employee relations Poor work/life balance, high expectations to be available at all times, even on your personal vacations, on call 24/7. Company is adding in salaried personnel but do not hold employees accountable so more salaried heads does not fix the issues. Fair compensation No work/life balance Poor management If you don’t go with the flow of what management wants from u and speak against what there doing they will work on eliminating you being in your position or with the Company. Productive and fast paced Fast paced but shift goes by quick. A solid company to work for that is going to close the doors on you. Pay is fair with advancements every 6 months until you cap out. They give you bonuses quarterly based on attendance and other factors. I would recommend CNH to a friend or family member who is looking for a new career. They offer a great sign on bonus. If you show up on time, strive to do your best, stay out of drama and politics that go with a factory job, you will do well. I do not regret my choice to work for CNH. Very laid back , positive factory setting I loved my time working there , wish I never left , just gotta make sure ur pay attention cuz some ppl are pretty slick and n try pawning there their cut corners on the new guy Great pay great benefits laid back environment and ample opportunities Stressful Didn’t mind the work but always ran out of parts, lack of communication to much favoritism and ran without parts a lot lack of training a lot of bad parts Pay is good Pay and insurance is good. They do not offer sick days and you only get paid sick time off if it is 3 or more days. It is hard to contact Hr if you work an off shift. Lots of turnover and inconsistent expectations. Not a good employer What HR tells you is not the case, your 4-ten hour days will be 5-6 days a week and 60-70 hours; shop supervisor did not provide adequate training; co workers were rough people who swore a lot; pay was great but you will have no life. Great tax team The tax group really worked together as a unit and the atmosphere was good. This is a decent place to work - you will be busy They are in Canada & the US so a good understanding of both markets is key You will need to wear a lot of hats and understand systems and how tax is applicable Culture is decent and they have added new employee training/intro classes which are very helpful Touring the plant is very helpful as well Liked working there, managers were awesome, but the ""hire and fire"" is the problem If Case could somehow refrain from the huge lay-offs I think they would have more people. I enjoyed working there, great pay and benefits. The main drawback is the lack of vacation, if you want a couple days off, you have to hope they will approve your whole vacation request. The other huge drawback is all the lay-offs. I thought about going back, but can not afford to be laid off and try to find another good paying job. Loved it wanna come back Loved it wanna come back very professional people are great pay is great they care and are helpful room to grow great breaks learning experience great management great hours great location take it seriously if you can Pay was decent; no growth potential The pay was decent after years of service. However, upper management did not value tenured employees and even after applying for multiple internal positions with a good record, I was denied. Productive, fun space to work Typical day starts at 7am until 4pm with an hour lunch. I have worked here for 5 years and everyone is accepting and welcoming. Management is not overbearing and the hybrid work environment has been adapted. Not the worst place but not the best. They don't care about quality. Until they do. Not the worst place to work. Management makes the job way harder than it needs to be. Again not the worst place but stressful. 3 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Co-workers What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Communication is lacking, management isn't the best, not a very organized company, and people are burned out working 50 to 60 hrs a week. If you're posted it's mandatory to work it. Quality company to work for Would definitely recommend working for this company. Training is on point, equipment is provided, and tasks are not unreasonable. Given ample opportunity to meet metrics goals. Equipment provided Repetitive work 4 6 Management chips in where needed, listen to suggestions The company is a large world wide cooperation but if you are a motivated good employee you don't get lost in the size. They pay attention and reward hard work and initiative 1 2 The place is full of cancer. In my 15 yrs at cnh,I was shown love and kindness,beyond belief.Management is friendly,caring and as honest as a southern vacuum cleaner salesman.The union has your back at all times and always treat everyone the same,true blue solidarity.Trust me when I say uaw local 807 has your back,same as the company,exactly the same as a matter of fact.The work is super easy and fun.All your coworkers are your union brothers,so everyone has your best interest in mind.The only bad thing is the CANCER!!!! Management Cancer 2 Great group of people working real hard to get the job done Great group of people working really hard to get the job done despite the never-ending changes in schedules. Told one thing and within a day or two (after you've made plans) they change the schedule and if you don't work you receive a point.... even though they just told you you had the time off. very frustrating for the hourly staff. 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? Pride in craftsmanship What is the most stressful part about working at the company? No parts to complete task What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Unfair to as during a strike but seems nobody cares. What is a typical day like for you at the company? 12 hour standing at station wishing you had parts to weld or someone who could answer a question. It’s a toxic work environment. It’s a place that chooses favorite workers and use to get them more benefits during the work time, such as bringing the best jobs to who they like more and bothering for production while they just get you the dirty job. You can leave any time. Short breaks, toxic environment, favoritism, racism, over pushing. Fun environment, easy job duties It was a fun environment, coworkers were great, management was great. supply chain issues caused some inconsistency with plans, but that is to be expected. Overall, really enjoyed working there. Just a place to work Place to work for a pay check , management don’t care about the blue collar workers … don’t work there if you want to be happy … don’t have anything good to say Its ok The work is easy. They’re kind if strict though. 8 point attendance system and people get written up easily. There’s an “us vs them” type of environment between the union and the company. Easy work Short breaks, strict policies, bad culture Great company Great company to work for. Have been here for 14 years and have not had any issues. Management at times seems to lose touch with reality but there is a constant shift. Management is horrible No heat Management is horrible Snakes and Raccoons Only one or two works makes Production because they have personal issue come into our work. No Circular flow work ethic just freestyle. They only ship 2000 parts the rest is Depo to Depo Pay is great but the work-life balance is terrible The pay was good and the schedule was great for me when I first started there. Monday-Thursday 10 hour shift and a 3 day weekend. Things started to turn when production went up which called for mandatory overtime and we had to work 6 days a week every week non-stop for months. And they have a point system in which you accrue points towards termination any time you are late or absent, which is an inconvenience to majority of people who have children or other responsibilities who can’t call off work without the fear of losing their job. Some team leads are cool and some clearly don’t care about the job. Same with supervisors and they also pick favorites. My coworkers were awesome but management and the lack of sympathy in the workplace is what did it for me. Great people and time flies Good job good benefits. Family like environment. Overall good company morale. Time goes fast because there is always something to keep you busy and engaged for the whole shift, overtime when ever you want Just a place to stack your money Overall this is just a place you work at to save up your money. This is a company that pays very well and has great benefits but will only see you as a number. This is a place that preaches quality over quantity but really doesn't care about that or safety for that matter. NOBODY in management has your back as an employee and will rarely fight against any injustice or mistreatment done to you. This was once a company where people stayed and had longevity. It's no longer such. We're overworked and underappreciated. Money, Great for the resume Short Breaks, Terrible Management, Alot of overtime All about the numbers. LOA to request time off. Good luck. LOA denied for family funeral even. Losing people that have worked there 10+ years because it's falling apart. Supervisors are horrible and don't have any care for employees. Get ready to work 6 days a week even if you sign up for 4-10's. Rework, missing parts, welders not being tested, anyone off the street with no experience hired, double standards. 12 minute breaks.. Union was week and attendance point system was horrible and very unfair. Due to Unuin contract pay was great and insurance....at least for another 2 years till renewal. I'll miss some of the people and definitely the pay but I can have my life back and sanity again. From day one I knew this company was messed up. wage, insurance, people Hours, leave, vacation only when shutdown, management, double standards terrible 5S. Poor management Supervisors don't care. You are just a number. They preach team work but in actuality it's only when it benefits 1 shift. Pay was good Supervisors Productive and fun workplace Hard working company Easy to follow Always busy Get paid every Friday very convenient Great staff flexible hours The site is around fast food and QuikTrip and the highway 45 min break Good ""Ol Boys Club, Poor Management If you're a hard worker, you will pick up the slack from lazy employees. Quality employees are not a priority with Grand Island plant, you are only a number. Decent benefits Poor management and HR Very Toxic!!! If offered a job, run for the hills!!!!!! No training, feel as you have been thrown to the wolves, never was felt appreciated for the contribution that one gave. The people are fun and very helpful Great place to work. Great pay. Easy job. Wonderful benefits. People are very friendly and eager to help. I really enjoyed working there. Would definitely recommend. Good pay and benefits. Great place to work. Financial services is the place to be. Professional atmosphere and everyone is like family. Plenty of room for advancement and moving around within 1-2 years. If you have the desire to work, achieve, and be successful, you can have a long career. Quality company to work for Would definitely recommend working for this company. Training is on point, equipment is provided, and tasks are not unreasonable. Given ample opportunity to meet metrics goals. Equipment provided Repetitive work 4 6 Terrible Atmosphere The pay and the benefits are great if you can handle management treating you like hot garbage. Lots of mandatory overtime so you will have almost no life outside of work 4 Stay FAR Away from Here. If you enjoy being treated like a human being, don't work here. First, they sucker you in with one of the highest salaries in town and a solid benefits package. Then they bring you in for orientation, where they don't hardly explain anything, including their policy for if you have COVID, so that you'll get pointed later on. After that, you're told you're gonna be properly trained. Instead, you get thrown to the wolves to figure it out for yourself. Next, they say they're all about family. Yet I was FIRED because I left work early to see my dying grandfather. All in all, no one is ever fully honest with you. You're only in Management's good graces if you're hitting the numbers they want. I wouldn't work here again if my life depended on it. Good pay and benefits package TOXIC work environment 4 CNHI Fargo, ND does not respect their employees. I saw a guy retire after working here 35 years and no one from management even said good bye to him. Worst company I have ever worked for. They treat you like you are not human. The Union is a spineless group or a click. The pay is so unfair. As a welder I should be making way more compared to a fork lift driver. No pros Inadequate pay. Hard to get time off. Way too much mandatory OT. Say goodbye to summer, because you woek every weekend. Unhealthy work environment. They can't even provide a fan. Morale is low The morale at CNH Wichita is very low and it is driven mostly by management. They make poor decisions on a regular basis and because of company brown nosing it makes it tough to succeed. Work is easy. Company don’t care about your your life. Only care if youre at work. You are to live life for the job. I’d recommend working here if you are ok with being treated like a number for the company. The pay is great job is easy. But your life doesn’t matter to them. You are simply a number. Great pay Easy work Good benefits You are to live for the job. Nothing else matters for the company. Your life, your problems (health, mental or financial) they don’t matter. Your a number. Productive and very busy! Never really felt like I for in but my job kept me busy so I felt the need to be at work everyday. I love it and would go back. But Day to Day you didn’t know if the company was gonna move you or lay you off. Solid company with clear objectives and expectations. Not many opportunities to advance career/no clear advancement plan for employees Solid company to work for if you’re looking to coast by while collecting a decent pay check for your work. Employee morale is good, sometimes politics take over especially when trying to move into other roles. No advancement plan for employees, forced to bounce around lateral jobs to get raises, HR doesn’t help you get into the roles you aspire for. Flexible hybrid work, good pay, good coworkers No career advancement plan, some processes and software need an upgrade from the 90’s Never ending 11 hour shifts Always working five 11 hour shifts. Hard to have a home life. Training is pretty much non existent. They expect too much out of new operators without training them. Pay Long shifts, no home life. They expect you to live for the company Sad No sense of direction or organization Incompetent Under managed Completely unreliable, can’t keep hours, constantly run out of parts They blame workers when they have no work Poor management Minimal yearly raises. No prospect for promotions. Incompetent management from outside hires that have no technical knowledge of the product or processes. It is a job You go in. You have a meeting. You do your job. And then you get paid. Has to be done. Easily done and you can easily lose track of time. The environment can be rough at times but worth while. It's a job Qoutas can be a pain. Nothing Not a bad company to work for not a good company to work management is the worst to with that dumping ground they need to treat there workforce better Its Cnh No direction theres no system of checks and balances Struggling to produce product New management has not affected a course change in a numbers only environment. Quality works for management. It's sad. everything is geared towards pushing tractors out regardless of their quality. Toxic environment Good pay Good Pay and decent benefits. Long hours when harvest season starts. Not much family / social life during that time, but nice big checks. Get trained on equipment pretty quickly Money and overtime Work more than being home Parts making total chaos Worked 16yrs and when started had great management. But as time went on older ones Retired and the good ole boys and girls club Stepped in. Managers are a joke. They will write You up for stuff beyond your control. And don’t think about having a life. Be prepared to work 3 Saturdays a month. Not impressed Benefits pay Horrible management no work life balance Excellent working environment Excellent working environment , Respectful environment, I feel happy at work most of the times, departments are organized and roles are well defined, Recommended ! Overall a Good Company Supply Chain issues has brought things down a bit but overall a great company. This leads to a lot of rework, stress, and time away from family which you would normally have. Best job ever Only problem is no matter how hard you work if you have a serious medical condition don't apply I found out I had one while I was there and got pointed out for leaving in an ambulance Amazing people Management Work can be fulfilling, but not what I anticipated I walked into the first day not really knowing what i was going to be doing, the first few years was a very toxic environment and was extremely unhappy but was going to stay to fulfill my vesting requirements of 3 years (the matching is good ) around the 2.5 year mark things got better and now we have had almost 2 years of COVID im well past my vesting period. Working from home has truly been a positive direction. I feel when the pressure is on it is on. I think as a company the culture and excitement can move up a few notches would keep people more happy. I think the company is going in the right direction and the products are becoming much more competitive it just takes WAY too long to produce and after many rounds of development the products coming out are dated. with covid working from home toxic environment Operations Supervisor The compensation with overtime on top of salary is ideal. Otherwise hours and culture were a bit lacking for the work life balance needed to raise a family. Overall I recommend the experience Compensation Mandatory Overtime Quality company to work for Would definitely recommend working for this company. Training is on point, equipment is provided, and tasks are not unreasonable. Given ample opportunity to meet metrics goals. Equipment provided Repetitive work 4 6 Not a good company but not the worst either. Work is hard for what they pay you for, no vacation time until 1 year in the company. Too long of a probationary period which is 120 days , and union is terrible!!! Not enough breaks one 10 and a 30 min lunch and we work 9-10hr days and 2 Saturdays and one off which sucks. Health benefits, you can leave for lunch Short breaks, no vacation time, terrible union 3 Worried everyday that we will not have enough parts to work a full week. Suggest working somewhere else due to the off the street work staff with little to no experience and no supervisor support for these situations. Work staff that have been their longer than five years do not have any incentive to stay but new hires get a hire on bonus throughout a one year time line. Company does not care about long term employees and their needs and wellbeing and financial situation. Extremely hot in the summer and cold in the winter. Pizza and donuts sometimes. 2 awesome place I absolutely love working here. THE company has some many mixed cultures. as a woman and a manager I feel like i am respected and there are other women on the same position. cafeteria on site heat on the floor No room for advancement They tell you the shift is Monday through Thursday with occasional overtime , but that they REALLY mean is Monday through Saturday. Communication with management is terrible, and the union is spineless. Pay is ok, everyother company in Fargo is creeping up to their pay though. No home life, unless you dont have a life then its perfect for you. No raise unless your job title changes. At least when I worked there, CNH offered no raises to its' Engineers unless your job title somehow changes. Also, if there is ANY conflict between Engineering and Purchasing, Purchasing overrules. Should you be an Engineer that runs afoul of Purchasing, you probably won't be working there much longer. There are many interesting products to work on at CNH, but the ""no raises"" policy wears your morale down pretty quickly. Many interesting products to work on. No raises. Purchasing dominates over Engineering. Company only wants numbers I wouldn’t recommend this product to my worst enemy. Company only cares about moving a product and fast not your well-being, safety or mental health. Good pay No Air conditioning, very fast paced, mandatory overtime, 11 hour work days on your feet, hot in the summer, people pass out from heat exhaustion, don’t care about safety. basically like walking into a cage in the morning 1. you will realize the excessive expectations the first day.... 2. you life will be consumed by this place vacations will be denied, Leave of absenses for normal stuff doctor, ect, will be denied regularily, the tractor is the only thing in this building, the quality of people they have brought hired the last year is at an all time low, if you can walk and talk, sign your name you got a chance to be hired.... 3 there is no quality in the building anymore... 4 management is about one thing money...... 5 STAY AWAY In the summer the heat index in the building will be over 100 For 10 hours a day they own you... Good company high turn over It is a very good company nice employees and management the work is t too hard and it's rewarding. However they do fire rather easily in your first 120 days if you miss once you'll be gone. I believe in being able to come in to work and that your best ability is your availability but sometimes people really need to take off and they should be able to look past that exspecially if you are hard working and don't have a habit of calling off. Besides that it's a great company Gossip favoritism Decent pay, you can keep your phone and listen to music, steel toes and safety glasses and gloves required, which can be annoying. People who have been there for years are bitter and set in their ways. Not a lot of people, so everybody knows everyone by name. Everybody tells somebody your business, the supervisors gets together and talked about you like the entertainment for the week. You don’t advance unless your kissing butt. Decent pay, plenty of overtime if you want it Supervisors treat you like children, gossip and favoritism It is what you make it Opportunity to be hands on. Good chance to work with and design large machines. Some of the work can be complex. However, you need to be in the right clique, play the politic game, and work hard to avoid becoming the go-to scapegoat (as finger pointing is rampant). I have seen it several times, where one person takes the blame for everything wrong in the world (practically set up to fail), then they are let go, then it is roulette for a while until a new go-to prize winner is selected. Clean Friendly place to work. Management was mostly fair an impartial. Kept everyone very well informed about all events and schedule. Helps all employees with questions in a timely manner Good guys, good place to work. Honestly a decent place to work. Good guys to with work. So what your supposed to and everything goes easily. They work with you to get what you need. Good place, good people Dynamic finance environment, declining morale PROS: The work in the finance area is very dynamic, always a new situation to learn from, in general the job tasks are interesting and come with a rewarding sense of ownership. Co-workers are good people. Benefits are good. CONS: Morale has been on a steady decline for several years. Constant head count reductions put increased expectations on remaining employees with little acknowledgement resulting in high turnover. Constant turn over means a lot of underskilled staff. Some of the upper managememt are disrespectful and boreline abusive in the way they talk to employees. No annual cost of living/merit raises, only way to get pay increase is to switch positions (options are often limited) or wait for a small pay bump that usually only comes every few years (new employees/contractors make more than employees with years of service). Challenging work, benefits Bad morale, understaffed, toxic management Lots of overtime! Work here as a temp. After 3 months you get hired if you do your job, easy job with lots of overtime. Company does good promoting within. Overall if you are willing to work overtime this is for you. Overtime, breaks, easy-going. Favoritism, management. Mediocre There is absolutely no work/life balance. The job really isn't hard, very boring and mind numbing but not hard. The pay isn't horrible either. However they require 10 hour days, 5 days a week then your also required to come in on one of your days off. They also give you absolutely no notice if O.T will be required. They'll tell you on the way out the door on Friday that you have to be back for a 10 hour shift on Saturday. You can't get trained on anything because the managers are simply too lazy. The hands on training was 2 hours long , then we were off by ourselves the next day. We were confused and didn't know what to do. I went to my managers for help and they straight up told me they couldn't help me and to find someone who could. They hide from the associates. (This is the training I received for any station in the building I worked in) HR is an absolute mess. Its like they don't even know how to do their job. Very condescending and demeaning when/if they talk to you. The break rooms suck. Theres so many employees that the vending machines are always out of everything. Its hot and humid in the warehouse In overall its very easy money. Just be prepared to work your life away. The pay is good considering the area the job is located, however the management is absolutely horrific. The job duties at CNH are very easy, all thing considered. The difficult part of this job is finding an appropriate way to handle the exorbitant volume of BS that comes from the management staff within and beyond this warehouse. The supervisors will grill you constantly about their unreasonably high quotas, the upper management within the warehouse will constantly change their ideas of how a job should be performed and impose/change rules to make your job more difficult with little to no benefit for the end result, and beyond the warehouse the corporate management cannot decide on a work schedule more than 2 days in advance, so say goodbye to any weekend plans you thought you were going to make. Paid Breaks (but not Lunch), Good Pay for the Area Too Stressful, Not Appreciated for the Work You Accomplish, Too much BS It’s a job Have to work mandatory overtime. Didn’t get a raise or any extra compensation for working through the pandemic. Management is always lying and the equipment is outdated. Good place to work CNH has been a great place to work and is full of great people. The benefits are some of the best I have seen out there. There does seem to be differences in priority between departments. Good people and benefits Ups and downs like all places!! Started out as a packer when the place first opened up(worked there from 04-06)!! Then I was seeing what utility techs do and became interested in that because the job had more perks then being a plain ole packer!!! At first it was a fun easy job....all we did is take the trash hoppers at the end of each packer line or at each area in the plant and dump them at the trash compacter!!! And various other little jobs!! As time went on though when the place got three shifts running lots of harder things got added to the area...weird stuff like hand building skids or repairing broken skids in addition to all the other things we did!! On most days we would come in and there would be loadsss and loads of trash left over from day shift!! Nothing was ever done for a long time then I decided to switch shifts... then that didn't work because then there would be lots of trash left over from seconds!! This was mostly because no one but me wanted to do the work!! Then eventually I went back to packing where I was fired for some made-up reason!! They make you sign a at will employment thing when you get full time..so they do not have to have a reason anyways!! That's OK though because all of the places I've worked at in my life was for play money anyways..never needed to work in the first place ...so...the joke was on them before I walked in the door!! They did give me my 6 months of unemployment (back when ui was normal)!! I give them a good review because ALL places have ups and downs anyways and nobody's perfect!! Steady work, long breaks Play favorites Not horrible, not good Everyone has a title. Decent co-workers, but some will knife you in the back to get their way. The environment is bad, very poor ventilation. This was the main reason I quit. If you've worked shift work you know there's always a competition between shifts, this go a bit extreme and you will be left with the worst work. You must suck up to avoid being screwed over. If you don't you have a bad attitude, so feign a smile and enjoy the abuse. If you're young, this is a good starting job to use as a stepping stone to a better career. Ability to walk out without questioning your decision 20 supervisors & being left a mess Quality company to work for Would definitely recommend working for this company. Training is on point, equipment is provided, and tasks are not unreasonable. Given ample opportunity to meet metrics goals. Equipment provided Repetitive work 4 6 Great Coworkers but No Advancement and Bad Management CNHi offers an unheard of 401(k) matching plan and good healthcare benefits. Most of the people I've worked with are friendly and supportive. That's about as far as positives go. The company as a whole is entirely too bureaucratic. Processes and approvals that should take days end up taking weeks or months. There are too many managers, and a large portion of them don't know the actual workflows they're supposed to be leading. This is partly because the only way to advance your career within CNHi is to job hop within. There is a lot of talk about developing talent, but no real actions. Also, there are no regular raises, and competitive alignments are few and far between. Bonuses are given out based on a ""calculation"" from individual and company performance but are entirely discretionary (i.e. similar positions with similar salaries with similar performance reviews getting different bonuses). Promotions are practically unheard of, but in rare cases, unqualified individuals can find themselves with a higher position and raise just by getting an outside job offer. To top it all off, CNHi and the brands under it don't even like to give freebies to CNHi employees - you have to buy the stuff yourself. Good people, 401(k) match Bad management, Little career growth 4 Terrible Management, some good people The company offers good benefits and pay, but that's about it. New Holland Product Managers do not care about their people, they will retaliate against their employees and tear them down to advance their own career. NH Managers have no accountability and will throw employees under the bus, pushing the blame onto field employees for anything that goes wrong, but take all the credit when things are going right. You can't trust the managers. Good Benefits Managers will tear you down to advance their own career 2 Good benefits, horrendous management If you want good benefits and pay it's not bad, but the management in the New Holland brand is horrible, and change direction constantly making it hard to develop a clear direction for employees. No sense of appreciation for the boots on the ground people, all their management is worried about is the next promotion. Benefits, pay, most of the co-workers are great. Horrible management, lack of direction, constant changes in plans. Not a great place Did all the work they asked me to do and still felt unappreciated and no encouragement at all. Mangers don't care about employees and do not address their issues. Good pay. The Co-workers are nice Overall an okay place to work, management has major communication problems and the overtime is draining. The co-workers are the best part of the job. Co-workers and benefits Communication form higher ups needs work Some people love it some people hate it Hours are unpredictable. Vacation is unpredictable. Projects are unpredictable. Management is unpredictable. Shutdowns are unpredictable. They can change anything at the drop of a hat. Lots of fairly nice people but lots of really awful people as well. Decent pay Hours are never set, long shutdowns, what they say about literally anything can be taken with a grain of salt Not very family friendly Horrible management, micromanaging, super busy, understaffed in Contact Management and Collections, overworked, under paid. NO RAISES EVER. No room for advancement. Good benefits No raises, micromanaging, lack of management support, understaffed It's a good ol'boys club This place don't care about your experience or skill they only care about who you know. Been here 13 years practically know every weld station. It's a big good ol'boys club Decent money They don't care about you Productive Worked there for 12 years and I would go back in a heartbeat. Work is hard but you get used to it and the supervisors are there to help. You can learn just about anything they have there they will train you and teach you if you put in for it Good people co-workers I've been in the same department for many years. Friends and family move up quickly. Pay has gotten better. Management's has gotten better which is making the company a better place to work Good benefits, place is getting rid of a lot of bad apples so it's improving. Could get stuck in mandatory overtime if in production Too many chiefs, not enough Indians Forced ranking, constantly thinning herd and losing experience. No raises. Good place to start. Huge company. Large variety of jobs. Many best practices of industry. Way too many levels of mgmt on site. Meetings just to inform next level of mgmt. Mostly good people Mostly bad mgt Fun Great place to work fun team to be around busy with a lot of new work and new product changing all the time a lot of leadership change over the years Really just not the job for me. Honestly I was good at what they had me doing. Of course a trained monkey could do it. I think it was the monotony plus all those Fluorescent lights. Walking on cement up and down the same isles with hardly any interaction with another human being. Some people love picking parts. It just wasn’t for me. Short seasonal shifts Only go through temp agency. Hard to get full time job security. No communication Nobody listen to anything you say and job training is not adequate. They act like they know what they are talking about but actually don't know anything. Good pay Mandatory overtime productive , easy and fast paced Very easy job however management and favoritism occurs . I worked there for a year. Until I pointed out due to my new born and my weekend shift schedule. weekly pay, vacation work atmosphere Not good for long term The capital side of the company struggles a lot with work life balance. There are many managers who don't understand that not everyone constantly wants to work overtime year-round. It’s a job. It’s not that bad. Lot’s of favoritism. Never felt like employment was very stable. Pay is good but always mandatory overtime. Overly dramatic climate. Overtime Overtime Productive place to work Really laid back atmosphere love the people I work with and wouldn't wanna work anywhere else I am happy where I am at. No complaints here. Management is nice Standard yet relaxed office job As an intern, I worked 40 hours a week over the summer and 20 hours a week during the school year. Hours were very flexible, and as long as your manager knows when you are available, they are able to work around your schedule. The office has a full cafeteria, and is close to many stores in walking or driving distance. Coworkers and management are all friendly and make you feel like you're part of a team instead of just working in the same area. CNH Industrial is part of FIAT Chrysler Industrial I was under contract, not direct hire. Good company, excellent, almost indestructible products (tilling equipment) trusted by farmers worldwide. Good management, smart and experienced workers. Low turnaround. Some co-workers had 25-30 years experience, even 2nd generation employees. Work ethics, Lean manufacturing. None"

Occasional catered lunch, they are care about placing you in a department that fits your personality No room for promotion, people are slow to make changes when needed Very productive and dry place to work. The legal department was a well-oiled machine that provided little by way of amusement. It was a little too stuffy for my personal taste, but we were also very productive as a result.

Its great Easy to talk to. Understanding with time off and demands on your time. Know if you're being overworked and let you finish on your own time when ready. Great for Learning Need to think more of the rep and the dealer group. They need to stand up for the F&I rep and listen to what is happening around them. Best in the world Excellent company to work for. Exceptional training classes Great group of professional people Good culture Nothing but upside moving forward Compensation None Great place to work if you enjoy the ins and outs of the Automotive Industry The company is great in that they care about their employees and want to make sure you are in a place that suits you. The people I work with are really nice and management is fair. The hardest part of the job is having employees of two completely different generations trying to move the company forward. The ones of the older generation like to keep things the old way while the younger generation is trying to come up with innovative ways to do things. Occasional catered lunch, they are care about placing you in a department that fits your personality No room for promotion, people are slow to make changes when needed Very productive and dry place to work. The legal department was a well-oiled machine that provided little by way of amusement. It was a little too stuffy for my personal taste, but we were also very productive as a result. I just don't think that type of environment is conducive to team cohesiveness. A typical day included extensive research via Westlaw and several short meetings with my supervising attorney regarding the research I conducted. I really enjoyed compiling inter-office memos used to determine the viability of the company's products given the laws and regulations in place. Great Wonderful work environment.

The environment was relaxed, with a lot of teamwork and lunches provided by the company. The work I did was engaging, with minimal time spent on upkeep of old technology. The upper management of the company is somewhat disconnected from the rest of the company, with the CEO being very ignorant of what the developers did and would often pull us all into a full day meeting just to try to tell us to work harder.

MIM Software| Great place to work at MIM Software is a nice place to work at. People are nice and have neat hobbies. They have an arcade room. Employees get their own office shared by few others. free breakfast 4 2 Do Not Fall For It Top level management is inexperienced and they often aren't connected to anyone within their department. They also promote poor leadership based on tenure and not skill. The company has been around for 15+ years but they are still pretending they are a start-up. People wear too many hats and the system is poorly organized. Executive leadership does not trust their top or mid level managers. The company micromanages every single thing in the company from the janitor to their Vice Presidents.

NOKIA|" I feel proud as Nokia employee Nokia is one the best companies to work. It encourages learning and growing opportunities for employees. It also compensates well. Work environment is very work friendly. 1 1 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? at the forefront of telco related technologies in 5G, AI / ML and more What is the most stressful part about working at the company? maintaining/supporting legacy solutions and at the same time needful investment/effort towards realizing the future vision. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? is good. one of the most ethical companies in US and abroad. Relaxed working from home mandate. Opportunities and new technical career path Some departments are mired in bureaucracy and others are more pragmatic. Different business divisions may as well be a distinct company. However, it's a large organization with opportunities to seek out the work you want to do with people and missions that excite you. Most roles can be hybrid or remote with strong work-life balance. Generous PTO from day one, ""unlimited"" sick days (2 weeks before short term disability), more generous parental leave benefits introduced in 2022 for US employees. Good place to work Great infrastructure, friendly colleagues, good learning curve, good benefits. It's possible to be exposed to different teams and have more visibility, which for instance helps getting a full time position Overall a great experience Recommended Challenging Place To Work Very difficult to complete projects given the complex organizational structure and approval process. Constant changes with very poor implementation. Hard to work Interesting but not beneficial, availability for 24 hours, Monitoring three shifts of 8 hours, hard field work, No extra bonus and medical support, No learning environment Ok Nokia is big company, and it all depends on department that you are in. There are huge differences between departments. The biggest disadvantage is middle management that does not follow the values and vision stated by top management. Strong work options Strong work at home capabilities, exposure to Matplotlib and Robot Framework, leadership and management clear about work directives, strong internship program Fun place to work with lots of opportunities for young people. I have worked at Nokia for 22 years. I started out in Mobile Phone design 1996-2006, then Nokia closed our facility, and I was forced to find employment elsewhere. I came back to work for Nokia Networks in 2010 and have been there ever since. My job has fast periods and slow periods, which takes getting used to. I believe most positions have more steady, even overwhelming workflows. Pay is reasonable, but when factoring in benefits, they are impossible to beat. Work culture is fantastic. You get to work with interesting people from all over the world. Flexible schedules, unbeatable benefits, fun culture, respect for the individual Sometimes too much bureaucracy and bad planning Technicien Dynamique et dévoué, un esprit de partage de connaissances, très déterminé et disposé à servir. Dans un esprit d'équipe et toujours aller au-delà de la volonté. good place I've been here for a long time; it's a great company to work. The benefits were better in the past, but they are still outstanding. Management and organization need to improve. Bonus no time to weekends, vacations, family Ok Company Laxk supports from upper management. Good benefits and salary. Work life balance needs improvement. If you want a career in tech there are better pastures. Terrible place to work Couldnt care less about any employees and pay the lowest in the industry. If you work your fingers to the bone, they want to know why you still have bone. You have 14 bosses Your work or time is never valued Good WLB In general WLB is good but you may be placed in certain organization with tight schedule which screw your WLB. Pay is suck compare to market. Lot opportunity for training, technical development and mentoring. People generally like to share their experience. In a short, you come to this company because of WLB and technical development. its interesting because each day tasks opens up your mind even more but no time to rest and your phone is always suppose to be close to you Working as a field operations engineer on a normal day at work was very interesting interacting with colleagues and at times customers you get to learn about there views pertaining the network performance quiet interesting. each day would came with its own challenge especially in rain season the road network to sites become very bad same times you get stuck and sleep in the vehicle and time you sleep on site if the fault you trying to resolve requires more troubleshooting or if the spares are not available. answering to calls from GDC is 24/7 in short you always have to be alert Cool place if you are not for working Absolute hole. A niche for aged and passive. Stay away. They like to speak long. Lots of meetings. Nothing is really moving. Lots of legacy. Hundreds of people just spend their lives there Fair company to work for This is a fair company to work for. There was reasonable work life balance. Decent paid. Good benefit. The industry has been going through so much change over the years and it was a challenge for the company to stay on the top. Excellent company with EXTREMELY intelligent employees I loved working there. It may be too challenging for some. There is some large corporation bureaucracy, but that should be expected in an organization of that size. I have only very positive things to say about Nokia, and I wish them the best. They were very fair to me, and they treat all employees with great respect. Great company for middle management roles Decent pay, excellent work life balance, true job flexibility, value driven company, however there isn't much in way of coaching, mentorship, leadership skills and abilities of managers are limited. Don't expect to be patted on your back, hope that the comp, benefits and job satisfaction is enough, which it is. work life balance, work from home, job empowerment & independence advancement, leadership development Senior Internal Auditor This is one of the most toxic places that I ever worked for. You will work at timezone difference of more than 12 hours. The workplace culture is filled with toxic competition, hostility, and bullying. The management does not care about how you are treated and most of them are just trying to protect themselves and climb the ladder. Pay is substandard in the U.S., with low job security. Environment is good though. From a work environment perspective, Nokia is quite good, and generally is a decent work environment. Everyone that leaves for another company reports that Nokia underpays however. I've gone 4 years with no pay increase, which may come to a head soon with rampant inflation reducing my income - forcing me to move. I'm lucky that my job continuously changes, so there are always interesting new things to find, even after 12 years in this role. The one big positive is that I can keep my work life balance in a very good place, as they are very flexible in work arrangements and hours (at least in my role). However some people report working 60 hours per week, but I think they might be doing it to themselves. I feel proud as Nokia employee Nokia is one the best companies to work. It encourages learning and growing opportunities for employees. It also compensates well. Work environment is very work friendly. 1 1 Exciting Place to work if you like to work on cutting edge Telecom Infrastructure Technologies Many opportunities to grow. Great work life balance. Really enjoy the ability to learn and grow. Lots of travel opportunities with customer facing job and great learning options available to all employees annually. Work from home is qualified (Experienced Employees primarily) Average Annual Incentives Good in general Good life and work balance, the salary is not bad at all and the management is considerate. workplace culture is relaxed and enthusiastic. I learned a lot from working there. Productive and fun workplace Exposure to all latest technology stacks. Good for keeping up with the ongoing trends. Leadership is also kind and supportive, easily approachable. No cons as such. Overall a good company; depends on your position/division/manager This can be a GREAT company or just a really average one. I've had some of the best teams/managers I could possibly ask for... and I've also had some really micro-managing & clueless managers. Good Great place to work I like my team and my manager. Good instruments and easy timeline. Woek life balance is encouraged. The campus in dallas is pretty Ask question when interviewing with Hiring Manager Unorganized doesn't have SOP in place for certain departments. No time to ramp up and get comfortable with your role and duties- task are given within first few weeks like you've been working with the org for years. Basically sink or swim. Very Innovative. Excellent company with excellent people. Opportunity to learn new things and experience cross functional training in different departments. Good leadership. Good benefits. None Good company to work for. Despite having been laid off with remaining Wireless R&D in N.A. - has always been a good place to work. Great work/home life balance, good pay, great benefits. Great people to work with and always learn from each other. Supportive work environment Good compensation and benefits. Excellent work/life balance. Supportive management and colleagues. Ability to work remote. Opportunity for advancement. Able to work remotely. Lots of downsizing in US. Buen ambiente lanoral Durante el tiempo que trabaje en la empresa, me senti muy a gusto con las tareas asignadas y siempre tuve apoyo profesional Obra social y premio anual. No se paga hora extra Good Good experience to work with.good people all around happy to be part of it .dmm.good go proud of the organization. Recommended for a fresher but not for experience friday lunch good place to work with. lot of fun activities than work. good learning center and advancement in learning. people are friendly and good when teaching young engineers betterment benefits salary Best Management Ever! I worked for Alcatel for almost 10 years and enjoyed every position I held. There were often re-structuring which led to having many different managers. However, I can honestly say that every single manager was supportive, professional, kind, and encouraging. I only left to become a full time mom. Excellent managers Long work hours Very modern and well-equipped office in Budapest Lots of opportunities and events. The Budapest office is very modern and the environment is multinational. I felt the Finnish mentality, there was always silence in the hallways but this may help working in the open office free coffee Place to explore your ideas. Good place to show your talent , learn new things and explore ideas.HR is good .Can take carrier growth and get opportunity to work in abroad.excellent place to work. Free snacks Within specified Time Good team for some business group Nokia have great benefit but not so good in salary. Some team is really good but the other team is very worse. This worse team cannot support the good one which cause the delivery quality is just enough. The most difficult project is multi business group project which impact every business group has it's own target so nokia cannot win the competition Great Benefit, some team is good and have great leader not good salary, own business group target Good place to work but WFH puts lot of pressure few projects are very good and latest technologies used for cloud learning is very good supporting peers salary not as per industry CLV is big plus here policies WFH causing more pressure. Mixed Bag Overall, Nokia is a very good place to work. But there are major differences depending where you live. Layoff culture in US unless you live in Silicon Valley or Dallas. Layoff waves scheduled each year Good culture Great comp CIO revolving door / IT instability Great Learning Experience They invest heavily in your training if your willing to put the effort into it. I met a lot of very knowledgeable mentors here, was a great place to work. Health benefits and training opportunities It’s a big company so sometimes you really are just a number. Opportunity to learn Not enough work life balance but opportunity to learn different software, procedures, and processes that could potentially aid in personal development for the future Coworkers Not enough work life balance I feel proud as Nokia employee Nokia is one the best companies to work. It encourages learning and growing opportunities for employees. It also compensates well. Work environment is very work friendly. 1 1 free coffee Free coffee for everyone and I get to eat great food. Very clean washrooms and the hardest part of the job is setting up. From then on you are good to go. Nothing good Constant layoffs, downsizing, and looking over your shoulder.... Shipped most jobs overseas. They didn't know what a raise was because they never gave you one..... Goal driven tough company to work for but fair. Prepare to work hard with not much compensation for extra time. Hard work will get you some reward. But tough to climb up the ladder. You are on your own for promotions. Company Has Been Spiraling Downward for Years The employees were extremely professional, helpful and supportive. Compensation and pay were good. The telecom industry has gone through decades of mergers and pruning, and Nokia will eventually dissolve. Management and organizational changes frequently occur and cause disruption and chaos. Changes don't appear to correct any identifiable problems, other than change itself. The US employees are very susceptible to layoffs since Euro counterparts are protected by labor unions. Also Nokia market share in North America is minuscule after killing off favorable Alcatel-Lucent product lines. It used to be a good company 15-20 years ago, but not anymore. Professional employees, Compensation and Benefits Low morale due to continuous job cuts, Extremely low job security, Inadequate career training opportunities. Production, fun place to work at. This was a wonderful place to work, I met some beautiful people all over the world. I was I could work for the company again. I ordered parts for the phones. I made charts, for my supervisor. Free lunches Health care Excellent people Great people. Interesting and challenging projects.Able to work remotely. Sense that you are working on cutting edge technologies. Always have energetic projects with smart people. Culture Nokia took all aspects of leadership and management as seriously contributing to success. Critical thought carried through all rank and file. They were very serious about business goals and the process of achievement without forgetting the individual. I’m Learning opportunities Sisu can overwhelm logic Slow moving Titan Nokia and ALU individually used to be a great companies. Post merger, its too big for its own good. There's a lot of product overlap. And the company is no longer serious about product innovation or investing in its people or skills. Leadership reorgs every 6 months, and they what to cost cut their way to profitability. Many decisions are driven by risk (aka cost), and almost every task is being measured by level of effort man hours next to it. More and more financial controllers on the calls than technical people to fix the problem. New CEO in 2021 wants 10K job cuts targeting much of US based employees since it's too expensive to cut in Europe, and instead investing in resources from India. European offices are on vacation in July and August If you're not getting laid off, then you get rewarded with more workload. no more technical folks left, just powerpoint and excel jockeys. Amazing place to work I have worked for different corporations and I think Nokia is the best. Absolutely a great place to work, great team, great management, great salary, great benefits, I highly recommend it. Co-op I worked as co-op for 3 years at the network operation center. It was a fairly laid back title as a network analyst and the work demand was heavily mandated by the number of contracts our team was supporting. Simple and well paying work. Excellent workplace for beginners and for experienced Excellent workplace for beginners and for experienced. It is highly likely that I recommend this workplace to all the others finding their right workspace to dwell in. Also, the team is good. Large company with silos Overall the company is changing and under constant change. However it is fragmented and is only competitive in its flexible hours, average pay and high number of vacation days. Otherwise, the employees are overall overworked. productive and fun workplace productive and fun workplace good management and knowledgeable people ,very nice environment and good work / life balance. a nice place to work in. Stressfull Rushing all work schedual and plans lo. Conflect of interest, favoritzm, problems and managers dont cover for employees when there is design problems and failling. Management is in India and the Philippines, they have NO experience with Cellular Environmental Engineering Management knows what you tell them. They read books on the work and misunderstand key facts and tell you the Wrong information, then blame you for thier problems. No Pros good diverse values, strong culture and cooperative environment. good company to work for in telecom segment as it focuses on work life balance and good corporate culture that is instilled from the top to bottom. Not very good salary and job security though. Excellent pay, benefits, and flexibility Enjoyed 28 year career with At&t, Lucent, Alcatel-Lucent, and Nokia Technologies. Engaging work, and lots of opportunities to advance. Benefits are/were very good. Bonuses seemed inconsistent and somewhat arbitrary. Flexible schedule. Large Company buracacy and politics Challenging work and fast learning The nature of the job is dealing with and transitioning into new telecommunication technology (like 4G to 5G) that would constantly be changed with different versions and you must adapt quickly. Many of the tools (software) you are given to do your job or training sessions hosted before doing your job are usually not very good. There are times where you are thrown into projects for your to figure things out by yourself, make your own tools, and find people to help you. The way to really succeed in this company is through some amazing co-worker friends that would almost always be willing to help. You will run into some who are always too busy but you are more than likely to find someone willing to help you to get you off on your own in projects. bonus and flexibility to work a diferente times depending on project and your aspirations no life balance, on call to work when ever needed Decent employer Decent benefits and good vacation if you have time-in-service. Global environment so hours can span timezones, but flexibility to WFH/etc is available. Time flexibility Home/work balance Good People company but technically laid back Good people company, employee supported by HR Too many re-org in management No cutting edge technologies Team culture is not that great Less US Federal holidays HR support Low Salary, laid back Technologies I feel proud as Nokia employee Nokia is one the best companies to work. It encourages learning and growing opportunities for employees. It also compensates well. Work environment is very work friendly. 1 1 Good experience Great company to work for at the time. Unfortunately, the innovation wasn't there and the company had to change course. Because of that many had to leave and look elsewhere. Otherwise, Nokia is a great company to work for. Work life balance Lack of innovation 1 Excellent Working Environment Excellent Working Environment Working as a team is easy Everyone is heard One gets promoted Skills can be enhanced No finger pointing Work compensation is good Typical big company with management problems at the time I worked there I left Nokia when it was Alcatel-Lucent, so I can only speak to that time period. At that time, the management was heavily loaded with former Lucent employees, and the prevailing attitude was to resolve poor management decisions, cut more people. Don't know what they are like now. I have no knowledge of the current leadership. It was a job. Poor leadership. Sad and outdated company constantly donsizing Use to work for the old Alcatel lucent as an it/telecom engineer which was under constant reorgs. Was no different after the Nokia merger. Started off with a mediocre to low salary out of college. They promised growth but it was nowhere to be found year after year. Things are done in very old fashion manner. What can I say, it was a job. Flex wfh, 22 vacation days starting No growth, managment lacks direction Great pay but many rounds of layoffs The best part of the job was managing my own time and work. However, this was also a negative, as we did not get much management support in efforts to look at new internal opportunities. The pay was good for work done. The worst part about position was knowing that layoffs were coming at least a couple times per year. Some teams seemed to get heads up about impacts to team while others did not. Hard work Very cut throat place to work. Make one mistake and you're out. No warning and without hearing my side i was let go. This was 13 days before christmas mine you............................ . Same approach, same results Nokia was once a fun and exciting place to work, not anymore. Years ago they lost the ""recipe"" for success. Nokia keeps doing the same thing (same leaders, same old methods) and expects different results. Flat organization, facilities, job security Overworked, low or no salary increase, competition eating them alive Good company to join in one of the growth countries The workforce in North America are often confronted with reductions in staff as positions are either eliminated and moved to a lower cost country. In such an environment, politics naturally emerge as teams compete for workload as well as recognition for value-add. Despite the business climate, the people, including management, are genuinely nice. Colleagues are cooperative and supportive. Genuinely caring and relatable people. Very limited career development and virtually no pay adjustments to match improving performance. Sporadic Work was not assigned to team members in a balanced way (sometimes this was a good thing!). Training was provided but was, IMHO, not that effective. As a contractor, we got time off/paid on major US holiday, but of course, no other benefits. Pay was great but the work was not that satisfying. Paid US Holidays Feast or famine projects Relaxed Culture Relaxed culture, without the panic driven sales cycle seen so often in the industry. Leadership is great and treats employees with respect, it's a comfortable place to work. Culture Lack of urgency from product teams Good people, the best in the market, but degrading working enviorement in SW business. Nokia uses to be an excellent company with great values and respect for people. Under pressure some things have changed, and a tendency to imitate the IT market practicies have somehow degraded the working enviorement ) specially in the SW space.Still I believe that Nokia has a future and that these cultural spike changes will be armonized under the new CEO. Flexible working hours, remote work, fair compensation Worst HR ever, no talent strategy, under strong competition. Tough times in hard market Nokia is having a hard time to maintain their US market share. Multiple layoffs. Can sometime be penny wise but dollar foolish. To focus on short term. Not for me This was supposed to be one of the best experiences I had it was a pretty decent job but they had there down as well you didn’t have any one to help you nor where you trained really good good thing it was a pretty easy job Restaurante near you and there’s a lake as well Short breaks, hardly ever was there a parking spot Productive and fun workplace One of the unique things about Nokia is its international presence and culture. This is a huge plus for me as it keeps things interesting. Additionally, there is an emphasis on work life balance. Amazing company! At least in 2007. Very pleasent and diverse company! I miss my colleagues! Many opportunities to grow and work into senior leadership! Working on an internatiol level is truly a gift! Working with limited independence or in teams that all respect each other! Consider travel and relocations. good place to work a good company with good culture, but with the bad leadership team, the company lost a lots of opportunity, management team never focus on improve the product, but only do the thing is sell or buy the different department and laid off. Career advancement and intense learning opportunities Excellent work culture and fairness. Projects can be intense at times, but get to travel and enjoy local culture. Fair in compensation and benefits. Buen ambiente de trabajo y alta expectativa de crecimiento Durante todo el tiempo que trabajé aprendí muchísimo en cada uno de los proyectos. Sobretodo al interactuar con personas de diferentes locaciones y culturas. Multi-national company In the US, the norm is many long hours, not required by management, but needed to get the job done with the available resources. There is an investment in developing leadership. Telecom is a challenging industry and there is more pressure to be the low-cost service provider. I have worked with some of the most amazing people and teams that are passionate about satisfying customers. Extensive travel and poor work-life balance I began with AT&T Network Systems (1986) and my business unit was spun off as Lucent Technologies. Lucent Technologies merged with Alcatel and became Alcatel-Lucent. Alcatel-Lucent was acquired by Nokia. I went from one year to the next never knowing what my fate would be. I feel proud as Nokia employee Nokia is one the best companies to work. It encourages learning and growing opportunities for employees. It also compensates well. Work environment is very work friendly. 1 1 No career advancement There is no career advancement in this organization. The company culture has been declining for the past 2 years and there is not many career prospects. Everyone is trying to save his job due to declining business. Nice place to work Proud company to work for and has great benefits. New office in Cypress Waters is beautiful. Can work remotely and travel limited to business meetings Employees were awesome. Excellent company. I will still work there if opportunity is present. The company has sense of direction. The management team are fully supportive of their employees. Nokia prefers Low cost labor Nokia bought out Alcatel-Lucent. We found out that they prefer the support to come from Low Cost countries. From there we had to support India who supported our customers. Nokia maintain the benefits and vacation from Alcaltel-Lucent. Excelente Es una empresa de servicios a multinacionales prestadoras de servicios de telefonía celular. Un trato excelente a sus empleados Los beneficios economicos No hay un filtro entre jefaturas I really love to work here. People are great attitute and helpful. I really love to work here, people are great especially my boss that she is very kind, patient and willing to explain if I do not understand. I strong recommend to work here. They care nothing about people that dedicated there life to telecommunications I worked for Lucent and Alcatel-Lucent for 20 years. I went and done anything they asked. Sacrificed time with family not just Monday thru Friday but weekends and Holidays that includes Christmas I actually risk my life in the middle east for them then Nokia came along and decided they didn't need me. There is a special place in the after life for there management team. Company is not a leader in the industry. Many quality issues. Employment issues. Company doesn't value it's employees. Communication from Management is insufficient. Training is sub par. Upper Management has made a series of missteps which has led to an unattenable position. Innovative, rewarded independent thinkers. A great place to work at in the past. It has since gone downhill since the company was acquired by a foreign company. It was not what it used to be. Company no longer support expenditure that does not yield immediate returns of investment, only focusing on the quarterly results. The company has gotten into a me too provider of low cost wireless communication systems as opposed to being a top notch innovator. Productive Environment In my opinion, the cubicles are small and you have no privacy for conference calls. They do have some conference booths/rooms for calls. You have very little storage space for documents or personal items. Great company to work for. Great company to work for with incredible finacial reward... Offered constant training and and the ability to work on cutting edge projects... Manager was always helpfull. work culture is toxic The employees try to delivery quality have their hands tied. There is limited job mobility and over the last 15 years rolling layouts. Each year goals focused on internal proprietary certification, instead of using open standard tools and software, to complete on personal time. The customers walked all over the sales team resulting in giving away services to sell software licensing fees. Limited cross-over job transfers or training even on hot products like 5G. Overall The previous company (ALU) was bought out by Nokia in 2016. If you were a former ALU employee you basically had target on your back. They recreated every wheel they possibly could and did not want to simplify any process; if anything they created unnecessary step in the process. They didn't believe in the American taking vacations, but they took their vacations and did it in large blocks of time. It was a fun company to work for prior; when it was ALU. Unrealistic; Had a good team to work with, people were very friendly. Management pushed for unrealistic schedules, with limited budget. Hard to manage a work/life balance. Flexible work schedule Unrealistic expectations and project schedules If you don't have a life, go for it, but expect to put in 60hrs plus a week Peers are great, most every engineer throughout the departments will help if needed. But then there is your narcissistic manager; calling you after hours while you sit in a doctor's office, demanding to join a conference call. Complete and utter disrespect for your work, not a thanks for the huge amount of unpaid overtime. Manager only focused on delivering numbers and if things don't go well, he would yell at you on the phone, frequently; but only in 1-0-1 sessions so there are no witnesses. Keeping up with training is also very demanding, plan to sacrifice your personal and family time. Director/VP level is an entirely different bunch of people when it comes to attitude, much better to deal with, more reasonable and really appreciative and open to logical solutions. Otherwise the job in QA is entirely customer driven; expect high demands and fast turn-around times, that's when your family life will suffer. competitive salary high demands, too much overtime. Nokia is trying to work hard to remain relevent If your in the right track its great. Otherwise it is tough to branch to other organizations. Nokia is driven and they have solid top management. Nokia will be around for a long time. Customer facing work The day starts working with the assigned customer and taking all the requirements, fulfilling each one of those. Challenging from time to time as each customers have their own different sets of requirement. Ran Engineer In Nokia new platform for me to start my carrier, with new goals & new opportunity in different domain. My manager encourage me a lot to handle the lots of obstacles comes with up & down in my carrier. Learned Coaching The day, when successfully completed 5 G prep project of 3500 sites in New York city within agreed time lines. The work environment was excellent and supportive, A fun and supportive environment and offer working remotely I started our working for Lucent Technologies which then became Alcatel Lucent and eventually became Nokia. I have enjoyed working here even through all the transitions. The people are all very supportive and fun to work with. I worked as a virtual employee which was a plus for me."
CITADEL ENTERPRISE EUROPE LIMITED| Good if work is your life If work isn’t one of your biggest priorities, maybe look elsewhere. People here work a lot and are driven. Culture is intense and probably not the worst it can be because there are definitely people that are nice and down to earth… but it isn’t for everyone. Just know what you’re signing up for when you sign your offer letter. Most people do, but if you’re on the fence, I would say— how important is work life balance/flexibility to you? Because this is definitely not the place for that if that’s your absolute priority. But if you want to challenge yourself and are okay with working a lot in office, then you might love it. Food, snacks 1 Fast Paced and Difficult Workplace Esp. For Contractors As a former contractor, job security was the biggest issue that I faced. The work, while challenging (in a good way) and fast-paced, and environment was not the greatest for bringing out the best in employees. Management varied per team, and therein expectations are not consistent across the board. Similarly, most contract roles could be ended without prior notice which contributes to a lot of stress and uncertainty. Citadel boasts about meritocracy, but it often feels like it's a game about picking favorites. Being a melting pot of mostly type-A personalities leaves much to be desired as well when different perspectives come in. Free breakfast, lunch, and dinner (if you stay after 6:30), great IT/tech support Team, company provided daily uber stipends during COVID, overtime pay Poor management, high-turnover, lack of formal training, lack of career path towards full time as contractor, no diversity Understaffed, and they like to put 2 on the floor each shift because they don't like to hire Since the pandemic they stopped hiring and let go of all of the agency workers leaving floors understaffed. Due to the overload of work it impairs your judgment and sometimes you can get written up if you dont do ALL of the work that a staffed floor would do. Overtime because they are always understaffed but its not worth the risk. Understaffed, no connection to HR and payroll is connected to HR so good luck finding answers about your pay. Worst experience of my life What I believe should have been a wonderful working environment for me turned out to be the worst experience of my life. And It have absolutely nothing to do with Citadel but the contracting company that hired me epiq global contract should end immediately. I experienced some of the worst management I ever seen and my coworkers were by far the most toxic people I have ever had to deal with. I personally think if I was hired directly by Citadel I will still be working there but I left due to the unbelievable stress that I was under with the contracting company that hired me. The Receptionist team was the worst!!! Free Lunch Hired the worst contractor company Terrrible culture Terrible culture. Does not take care of its employees. Firing is very blase. Turnover is extremely high. They allure people with their name, money and cutting edge tech. Great Place to work in your 20's Competitive environment that expects long hours from employees. No work/life balance and there was huge turnover - there one minute, gone the next. Good benefits, free meals and nice perks. Environment encourages finger pointing and blaming others for mistakes. Management takes credit for work, and no chance of advancement. Good job for starting out in your 20's but not long term. Good benefits, meals, perks No work / life balance The good was learning all you wanted to learn. The bad was only for those that did not hit the ground running. IF you knowledgeable in the field in which you wish to work in at Citadel you will do well. The culture is that of a winning organization. There is no room at this table for mediocracy; one has to be sharp and eager to be part of the best of the best. Coaching is always available and you must want to be better at being the best. That is all. Learning and Lunch...We were always learning and lunch was always great. Unprofessional Management does not care about you. Very unorganized. No training or orientation provided. They will put you directly on the floor with no direction. It can be a lot at once, especially if you have no experience in this kind of environment. There is a lot of gossiping and talking bad about other co-workers too. Super disrespectful. A great environment. The best work environment I worked at , I was motivated to do the best of me and never give up. My receptionist was the best person I've met, she never let me down at work and pushed me to do my best. Horrible place do not come here They need to fire all the managers.Very petty and show favoritism.Don't come here and this place need to shut down.They pay lower than minimum wage.This place is not a good place to work. Residents are great Greg and Anthony are horrible managers . Intellectually stimulating environment Rigorous environment that provides interested individuals many opportunities to learn about portfolio construction within a market neutral strategy. Access to many resources, both internal and external, allows for expanded learning opportunities that enhance investment decisions.

Fast paced environment Key focus is delivering results and adding value in a timely manner. Lower tolerance for mistakes, but employees are compensated well and the team work very well together Clearly a good place Clearly a good place. Lots of people like it and some don't they pay enough so there are no complaints. Not much good communication between my manager and myself.

Entrusted with securing an investment firm with locations all over the world. Assisted the CEO with daily duties. Director Database Tecnologies I worked a Citadel from 15 years and watch the firm grow in depth and breath across the world. New Management comes in every few years and they brought their own folks in. Fast paced, very high standards/expectations I enjoyed the culture and atmosphere and colleagues at Citadel. Unfortunately, the IT staff was deemed dispensable after the Oil Trading group lost 100M in a week when Hurricane Katrina took the Gulf refineries offline and oil prices spiked when they had a large position against that possibility. Very unfortunate that they valued making up the clients money loss over the personnel that had nothing to do with the major loss on the trades. High standards, intelligent colleagues, nice office not enough regard for human capital/assets Fun Workplace with Catered Lunches! Great place to work, I had to relocate and they let me keep my job but work from home. Very accommodating. Extremely intelligent, productive and professional people. Free Lunches Contracts Good work but stressful environment Good work but stressful environment. My boss was great but, there were many changes that made it a difficult place to work. Regardless, pay was good. Free lunches Meat grinder Need to bring A game every day! High stress environment. High stressed individuals. Not a lot of fun to work. Company wide policy to lay off 10% every year. Does not make work/life fun for those in the bottom half though highly skilled and very good people. Nice amenities Very low tolerance for mistakes/errors Fast paced, exciting Not an easy place to work, but if you are smart and hard working, it's great. Management can be tough because the consequences for mistakes can be severe. Catered lunch, gym, good healthcare Have to have a thick skin Impact Great place to launch your career. Fast paced environment allows top performers to succeed quickly. Great perks: breakfast, lunch and dinner served. No need to leave the building! Workplace A high performance organization that will push you to your potential if you can keep up. Not a place that you should join if you're not willing to put in the time. Great place to work Great place, but very hard to get in. I really enjoyed my time here but I was only a contractor. They require high degrees and various amount of experience so be prepared. Nice work environment Good work environment supportive team Experienced Senior Management Technology savvy Adoption to dynamic IT changes to drive business Growth options available contract this review is pointless, i was contracted, not full time, having this required is a failure for Indeed. only about 40 characters left so i may proceed. very helpful Citadel was a great working environment.

The company was very large, spread throughout the US and everyone who worked there took much interest in their job at hand. miserable place to work Awful management - no work life balance. Stay far away if you are in HR or Recruiting. Overwork employees until they are at their breaking point. 1 Poductive professional workplace. I am skilled in performing all tasks relevant to this job such as greeting visitors, letting the appropriate party know when their guests arrived and where they have been seated. Answering a multiline phone system, and transferring calls to the appropriate party or relaying messages. Some of my daily tasks are managing calendar items, such as business meetings, vacation time, lunch and dinner meetings with clients or upper management and Town Hall meetings. Checking emails promptly for my team and replying to them when appropriate or either alerting team member when necessary. Making travel arrangements, travel agendas, and apply for business visas when traveling internationally as needed. Establishing, and maintaining office records and some personal duties.

The company encourages innovation, creativity and continual improvement. Change is good and hard work is rewarded. The company takes very good care of its people.

I would recommend this company to anyone who's looking for a second job fun events doesn't have steady work Best Job you can ever have. This has to be the best job I ever had in a long time; I would never want to leave it.

I experienced some of the worst management I ever seen and my coworkers were by far the most toxic people I have ever had to deal with. I personally think if I was hired directly by Citadel I will still be working there but I left due to the unbelievable stress that I was under with the contracting company that hired me. The Receptionist team was the worst!!! Free Lunch Hired the worst contractor company Terrrible culture Terrible culture. Does not take care of its employees. Firing is very blase. Turnover is extremely high. They allure people with their name, money and cutting edge tech. Great Place to work in your 20's Competitive environment that expects long hours from employees. No work/life balance and there was huge turnover - there one minute, gone the next. Good benefits, free meals and nice perks. Environment encourages finger pointing and blaming others for mistakes. Management takes credit for work, and no chance of advancement. Good job for starting out in your 20's but not long term. Good benefits, meals, perks No work / life balance The good was learning all you wanted to learn. The bad was only for those that did not hit the ground running. IF you knowledgeable in the field in which you wish to work in at Citadel you will do well. The culture is that of a winning organization. There is no room at this table for mediocracy; one has to be sharp and eager to be part of the best of the best. Coaching is always available and you must want to be better at being the best. That is all. Learning and Lunch...We were always learning and lunch was always great. Unprofessional Management does not care about you. Very unorganized. No training or orientation provided. They will put you directly on the floor with no direction. It can be a lot at once, especially if you have no experience in this kind of environment. There is a lot of gossiping and talking bad about other co-workers too. Super disrespectful. A great environment. The best work environment I worked at , I was motivated to do the best of me and never give up. My receptionist was the best person I've met, she never let me down at work and pushed me to do my best. Horrible place do not come here They need to fire all the managers.Very petty and show favoritism.Don't come here and this place need to shut down.They pay lower than minimum wage.This place is not a good place to work. Residents are great Greg and Anthony are horrible managers . Intellectually stimulating environment Rigorous environment that provides interested individuals many opportunities to learn about portfolio construction within a market neutral strategy. Access to many resources, both internal and external, allows for expanded learning opportunities that enhance investment decisions.

Lower tolerance for mistakes, but employees are compensated well and the team work very well together Clearly a good place Clearly a good place. Lots of people like it and some don't they pay enough so there are no complaints. Not much good communication between my manager and myself. Good if work is your life If work isn’t one of your biggest priorities, maybe look elsewhere. People here work a lot and are driven. Culture is intense and probably not the worst it can be because there are definitely people that are nice and down to earth… but it isn’t for everyone. Just know what you’re signing up for when you sign your offer letter. Most people do, but if you’re on the fence, I would say— how important is work life balance/flexibility to you? Because this is definitely not the place for that if that’s your absolute priority. But if you want to challenge yourself and are okay with working a lot in office, then you might love it. Food, snacks 1 Fast Paced and Difficult Workplace Esp. For Contractors As a former contractor, job security was the biggest issue that I faced. The work, while challenging (in a good way) and fast-paced, and environment was not the greatest for bringing out the best in employees. Management varied per team, and therein expectations are not consistent across the board. Similarly, most contract roles could be ended without prior notice which contributes to a lot of stress and uncertainty. Citadel boasts about meritocracy, but it often feels like it's a game about picking favorites. Being a melting pot of mostly type-A personalities leaves much to be desired as well when different perspectives come in. Free breakfast, lunch, and dinner (if you stay after 6:30), great IT/tech support Team, company provided daily uber stipends during COVID, overtime pay Poor management, high-turnover, lack of formal training, lack of career path towards full time as contractor, no diversity Understaffed, and they like to put 2 on the floor each shift because they don't like to hire Since the pandemic they stopped hiring and let go of all of the agency workers leaving floors understaffed. Due to the overload of work it impairs your judgment and sometimes you can get written up if you dont do ALL of the work that a staffed floor would do. Overtime because they are always understaffed but its not worth the risk. Understaffed, no connection to HR and payroll is connected to HR so good luck finding answers about your pay.

Battelle|" Great project but terrible managment Dupont schedule, 12 hour rotating shifts. Great pay but advancement is only given to friends of management. There is definitely a good ol boy system within the company. Pay Everything else Great Learning Experience This was a contract position during the height of Covid. This position is closed and the contract ended. I enjoyed working with Battelle and learned a lot during my contract with them. Was good experience and I liked it The company balanced all their stuffs...they were very observed and working with them was a good experience, while there,they must train you after the you passed the interview that is after 2 to 3 days..and there after you would start your job after a week or so. Monitored bms system A relaxing place to work. As long as you show up. Staff are noisy and want to know your business. Lack of work could be a good or bad thing depending on if you want it. Expect no growth and training You get to work with some very smart people who are leaders in their fields and have years of experience. Work was always varied and interesting. I got to work with people from many different disciplines. However, it seemed like there were too many meetings during the day and never enough time to get work done. Workload was high. Performance expectations are also very high, so it seemed like I was always working. Work life balance is hard to maintain. Flexible regarding taking PTO, good benefits and pay Work life balance is hard to maintain, workload is always very high, performance expectations are also very high Contracting for Battelle Not a bad gig, they paid well but their benefits are subpar compared to most of the big contracting agencies. i dont feel like i have the opportunity to move up in my job Overall a good place to work The company always has new employment opportunities especially if you're like me and like to jump around. They typically hire from within and generally just care about their employees. Lack of direction, very little guidance Overall, the experience was mostly negative. As an entry level engineer, there was a lack of guidance and direction. The onboarding process was basically nonexistent. Thankfully it was only a 6 month contract. Generally a good place. Interesting work and good mission and team. Great work life balance, 9/80 schedule, good PTO, and flexible with WFH. Promotions can be difficult to get, often there are back room politics involved and it varies group by group. Promotion opportunities can also be limited. Pay is also low compared to industry. Not Recommend for contract. Could end at anytime. Not much room for advancement. Promotions are based on favoritism. Ask for payscale or you'll be underpaid. Supervisor is constantly away and not online. Also, doesn't like questions and can't answer them. Supervisor also constantly has outdated information. Beware of contract positions Job was fine. No benefits for the contract position and they ended the contract position day of no warning at all so beware of that. 0 job security. Left a sour taste in my mouth and the mouths of my co-workers. I won't work for them in the future. Great People Is A Good First Step Pros = Great people. It's the one thing that will make you want to stay. Cons = Pay is stagnate, advancement is flat. If you are a contract worker you are disposable. People are nice and professional, Relatively low stress environment Benefits don't exist if you are a contractor, Benefits as a full-time employee aren't great, Pay is stagnate, advancement is flat, If you are a contract worker you are disposable. 100% the good ol' boy system The work is easy however, monitoring makes the least out of those on site. Corporate payroll is absolutely useless and pay and benefits is chronically messed up. The monitoring manger is not a manager, he was simply groomed and promoted after being on site forever. Overall, if you can sit and be passive and not care about less technical working making more than you while you are consistently busy, this place may be for you. They also simply do not care about any sort of worker retention. People leave and cant be replaced so the remaining worker drones fill all the gaps and work harder to cover the missing man hours. It’s a great place to work as a contractor. I have really enjoyed the last few years at Battelle. The team gives you a lot of flexibility especially in these trying times and the benefits are great I would highly recommend anyone working here. Pto, management, work from home policy. Travel, instability during contract renewals. Overall descent company. Your experience will depend on your management. Be prepared to be laid off at anytime. If your not laid off you’re overloaded with the work from the people who were with no additional compensation. Meaningful work Unrealistic expectations from management Long hours but rewarding culture and pay I was taken on as a CCDS Tech back in 2020. Our job was to travel the country to different cities with hospitals running low on PPE and run it through a decontamination process for reuse. We worked 12.5 hours a day, 7 days a week, for 3 or 6 weeks at a time with 3-5 day breaks in between each rotation. The work was exhausting, we were always running on coffee and little sleep, and sometimes there were coworker tensions because of that. But we were making roughly $115,000/yr and always felt a sense of purpose and contribution to society. In spite of the cons it it my favorite job I've ever had. Productive place, great place to earn money Great place that helped me grow into a professional. Was happy with my experience during the covid-19 pandemic. Would love to do this job again and it was great. Free Lunches Long hours Strong operations system I would recommend working with Battelle for the operations system and the direct and regular communication between the groups. I was fairly compensated, trained and managed by Battelle full time employees. Strong attention to detail and logistics, great professional network The culture did not make me feel comfortable Coercive and Discriminatory. Morale horrible. Great pay and benefits, but not much else. To much of a liberal, woke culture and they have no problem firing people that have been good employees just for not getting a Covid shot. Used to be a good place to work, but not anymore. Good pay, benefits and work schedule Liberal/woke ideas, just a number to them, bad management Great Company Nothing negative to say. The only issue I have is how over the top they are about getting the vaccine. Even with the court pausing the mandate. The company is focused on contract research which is high level consulting. Pay, Pto, highly intelligent employees Be very skeptical of the job being sold to you during the interview process. The first red flag was having HR lowball the salary figure given to me during the interview process by 20k, it eventually went back up to the original amount but only after being told repeatedly over the phone that I was being unreasonable. The second red flag was having two senior research members quit within the first two months of joining, and they were supposed to be the people who'd train me. They were also not the only people to leave during my time with Battelle. The third red flag was discovering the job sold to me during the interview process wasn't anything close to the work they wanted me to do. Management at best can be described as a disorganized mess that perpetually trips over itself to barely meet the minimum project goals, project reporting standards seemed to change on a monthly basis, which is a real shame because at the moment there's still a lot of good talent within the science and technical staff at the company. Battelle sells itself as an innovative research lab but from my experience is only focused on fulfilling pre-defined government contracts. Competivie base salary, Nice people to work with at the technical level. Systemic moral issues, Poor benifits outside of base salary, Little to no support for the science staff to collaborate and come up with new ideas. Great project but terrible managment Dupont schedule, 12 hour rotating shifts. Great pay but advancement is only given to friends of management. There is definitely a good ol boy system within the company. Pay Everything else Traveling was the best part! I can honestly say this was one of the best jobs I’ve ever had. Traveling across the USA and getting paid very well was a great experience for me I recommend this job to anyone who can withstand a lot of travel. Pay None 1 2 Good company history, but my local management doesn't seem to care May not be the norm overall, but where I work there's no mentorship or guidance from management. They throw you in the deep end of the pool and see if you can swim. No guidance on their systems, no leadership, all they care about is the bottom dollar. Demil is almost done, and with it will be your time with Battelle There is no communication from corporate regarding policy changes, and management on site rarely knows what's going on. Work-life balance is pretty much non-existent when working the DuPont schedule, and most management is on a 4x10s day schedule so you may run into them maybe 4 days a month as a shift worker. Policies and procedures can change, and you will be the last to know. Pay is decent for the area, but the closest city to the job site isn't the safest place to live. The work itself isn't particularly difficult, and there is lots of down time depending on the department and role. Shifts are long at 12.5 hrs for salary-exempt positions. Salary-exempt shift workers are required to record hours worked and often work over 80 hours / 2 weeks. All overtime (over 80 hrs/pay period) is paid out at regular rate, but taxed as overtime. Corporate constantly changes when pay-periods end, and how time is recorded on the last day of the pay period. Previously the pay period would end at 12 noon every second Friday, but now with the new time recording system, it has not been clarified as to when the pay period actually ends, and may be different depending on your specific role / shift, essentially whenever it is best for the company to have your pay-period end. Pay vs cost of living Overly bureaucratic Outstanding company with an important mission I get to work with some of the smartest, most creative people in the world to solve the greatest challenges to our environment, national security and health every day. The mission is to develop technologies that do the greatest good for society. Trusted management with clear and transparent direction. It really is a dream job. Great compensation, intelligent and caring culture, on-site gym, flexibile, 9/80 work week Benefits are on par with industry standards productive place to work Loved working at this place, loved working here and all the people. Would recommend, loved working here. Min characters, just trting to see other reviews loved working here Unique experience with multiple opportunities I was hired for a temporary Contracted position. The company throughout the project was supportive and informative. They were proactive in maintaining a positive work experience overall. Good pay, productive environment with many opportunities. Long hours, training could've been better. Ccds A typical workday was what you made it, I like to work so my days were very busy. Some days were slow, but you find stuff to do. Management varied by site, most were very good. The teams were small so you really got to gel with the others on the teams. The hardest part of the job was chamber time, I spent up to 3 hours in a chemical suit with filtered air in a sealed chamber. lot's of over time, and great teams shifts were 12 hours a day 7 days a week for 3 weeks Large Corporate Culture As an intern, it was very much ""find work on your own and don't ask questions"". I was very bored and constantly asking people for work which always ended up being data entry and management. I understand it needs completed but engaging interns should be essential to furthering your growth. If you have a medical problem they lay you off Management is terrible, they aren't very good. They promote their favorites and everyone else just goes to work. They will not tell the truth and lie to your face.Also when you file a complaint with the management in Ohio they never answer your complaint. Money Pick favorites and they advance. Good place to work but they cut benefits Good place to work, I'm an hourly employee. They cut the benefits a couple years ago, PTO and sick time is all in the same pool, so if you call off it comes out of the same PTO. You start out accumulating 2 hours a week. Great compensation and managers are there to help I worked as a decontamination technician during the summer decontaminating N-95 masks for Battelle and they paid very fairly and were clear about what the job would entail. Overall I ended up working a lot, but they paid extra for OT and this allowed me to make great money while only having to work for six weeks. Per diem, caring team leads, respected company Long hours Lacks Professionalism Great pay, per diem, paid travel handled by supurb staff. Poor training in Columbus. Trainers lowered expectations. Even with those expectations, it was still a surprise to witness the poor attitudes at the site. Few cared about the required continuing training. This was due to the typical apathetic Site Leads. Those same Site leads often chose even less motivated Shift Leads. Great Pay Unprofessional Work Environment It is what you make of it It can be a bit hard to advance but not impossible. Depending on the department you work for, you may be overwhelmed. The training is almost non existent but they are working on improving that. My manager is spread way too thin and has no idea what I am capable of. It is a good place to work with potential to grow if you are ambitious enough. Good stepping stone job. Flexible with work/home balance. Not micromanaged 9/80 schedule makes it hard for hourly employees to make up time if emergency arises, No sick days, have to accrue PTO to use for vacation/ sick days Productive place to work. Great place to work. Do this for a summer for 6 weeks working 12 hours everyday. I thought I would hate my life but I loved it. Met a lot of new people and the work was not bad at all. Great set of employees None Great Company Battelle in general is a great company to work for with decent compensation rates and benefits. If you have a skilled trade it will go unnoticed but if you have a college degree then your worth something to them. They will not utilize a persons skill set even if it could fill jobs in other departments and benefit the company. Weekly pay, work hours Skill set and quality of work goes unused and unnoticed. Pretty exciting mission, but the exciting jobs require a long commute We’re still hiring! At INL your safety and welfare are our top priority. We’re particularly mindful of this during COVID. We’re still actively hiring, and are adapting our travel, visitor and hiring processes to COVID conditions. In a challenging global work environment that changes on a day-to-day basis, we support remote work strategies maximizing employee well-being, collaboration, and productivity. For the most up-to-date info on what the lab is doing to protect against COVID, visit https://inl.gov/covid. Good pay. Lwt Their pay was good but they offboard you without giving a notice. Lost my job to them now I'm not able to feed my family . Very long hours of work also not enough time for educational trainjngs Car, accommodation and food No breaks Full disclosure and transparent company For the position I was hired for, everything I was to expect was presented to me on the phone. Nothing was hidden. This company works well on the phone with any questions. My site lead was very professional and helpful. Things had become tense at times with the work crew, but it was quickly resolved amongst ourselves. Treated with the utmost care and respect. I had to leave due to medical complications. But am wanting to return. Respect, training, pay, teamwork 7 days a week, 12 hour days. But we knew what to expect. No job security There is no job security at Battelle. Every decade or so there is a mass layoff to reduce the number of more senior staff and keep pension/503b contributions down. The people you get to work with are some of the smartest most dedicated people you could ever wish to encounter. It is sad that they are not valued after they become too ""old"". Great experience Great pay and experience! It does get tiring seeing the same 7 people for 3 weeks but if your a social person then you’ll be fine! Plus the pay helps tremendously! I made $1900 weekly. Wish I would of stayed but I didn’t. Also if your fine with traveling for free, this is the place for you! Great project but terrible managment Dupont schedule, 12 hour rotating shifts. Great pay but advancement is only given to friends of management. There is definitely a good ol boy system within the company. Pay Everything else Great place for early career Fun place to work, with other young people. Get experience in ecological data collection. Management will vary from office to office, but mine were very nice. Most of all Battelle cares a lot about their workers and their safety, which is very reassuring when working in the field. safety focus, good management, work outdoors pay is a little low, tech positions are seasonal, minimal benefits Fine, kind of cliquey Lots of competition within group, up to you to find work, but can be hard to find. Upper level engineers have little time to give you. Every one seemed stressed all the time. Pay was well below average. Climate controller clean work environment with average to minimal stress. I enjoyed working as a team to produce quality products for our customers. My manager was available to discuss daily concerns. The building was clean and climate controlled, mostly due to process controls required for quality work. The group/team worked well to promote members within and encouraged hiring people we know/referred. Climate controlled work environment. Health Insurance on first day of work. You have to work for 6 months to get a paid day off. Burn and turn atmosphere. Didn’t really care about employees. People were very cliquish. They didn’t work as a team. Some would only do one or two things, rarely pitched in to help each other. I was there a year and left as soon as I could find another job. The pay was low to and was pretty much a burn and turn atmosphere. Good work hours Burn and turn atmosphere. Didn’t care about keeping good people. Great Experience The people and the managers all treated me with respect and it was a great place to work. The work was exciting and rewarding. The only downside was the travel but that was part of the job that I took. I would certainly recommend anyone who doesn't mind working on the road go to work for an outstanding company. Travel perks, Airline and Hotel Points Being gone from home every week. Security Officer Great place to work with opportunity for advancement very close family atmosphere. Every day is a new day and the CEO is involved in day-to-day operations. Work life balance None Love this opportunity!!!! I went into this job knowing that it is a temporary opportunity and that the work life balance is not a great one. These are unprecedented times that we are living in and I am so proud to be a part of a team, fighting to keep everyone as safe as possible from COVID-19. Everything about what I do and the company I am working for is wonderful! Top pay and great per diem None Could have been a false vacancy... Recruiters string new employees along and pass you from one rep to the next if and when they decide to talk to you. Accepted a job offer in early April and finally heard back in late June that I will be starting training in July. I needed a job within the week, not the year, but not worth stressing about a 21 day assignment. The pay is good but they rotate your shift randomly so you have no consistency or sleep schedule. According to another employee that actually got work, recruiters don't tell you where in the US you'll be relocated until you actually get to the airport. Per Diem pay long days, management doesn't care Good employer Very management driven. Hard to entertain new processes and ideas. They value their culture and not open to change. Overall a great place to work however. Great company This is an amazing company to work for, I am a temporary employee with sights on becoming full time. I believe in what Battelle is doing scientifically to better everyday life. Good work/life balance Good work and life balance on a past contract. Left company due to position converting to the GS pay scale. Good management and pay while employed by the company. Changing research opportunities My boss's job title changed three times in a year to pursue projects, but his research was satisfying and was somewhat insulated from politics. He was a good mentor. Good pay, poor management Pay and benefits are acceptable. There’s a lack of advancement opportunities which may discourageYounger folks from joining the farm. There is also a clash between old culture and new culture that can make things difficult Good pay and benefits Culture, advancement and lack of diversity Innovation Was the best career move I ever made. I did learn a lot about my trade and about myself and my interaction with my customers really gave me a feeling of pride Contract research often requiring long hours to meet tight deadlines In the department I was in the situation alternated between either too many projects (not enough people to perform them) or not enough projects (too many people fighting over limited project hours). This worked out to either being overworked in the former OR in the latter one was always in fear of being downsized. In the former case you might be assigned a 60 hr task and given only 40 hrs. In the latter case you might be assigned an activity creating the temptation to draw out the work to have hours you could use to account for your full 40 hours for the week (reducing efficiency). This temptation was amplified because of the continuous reminder by managers that your time had to be accounted for (i.e.charged to a project). it seems like more and more companies are going this way so in many ways Battelle was ahead of it's time. Very dissapointing. No room for growth if you are not friends with supervisors. I was a temp without benefits for 3 years. They ended up cancelling my contract without explanations or notice supposedly because I was not ""insurable by the company"". They never stated there were parameters to be ""insurable"" during the 3 years I worked there, neither were able to explain them at termination. They are disrespectful to the hard work of their employees, and are extremely unprofessional by not giving reasons to fire someone after three years. Hard work/life balance The location of the contract work is an army chemical depot. It is located fairly distantly from the nearest town. The shifts are alternating days and nights and are 12 hours in length. I was hired as a contractor, told there were good prospects for long-term employment, but abruptly let go. Hired as a contractor, I was told long-term employment prospects were very good, I received very little feedback on job performance from management, and was abruptly let go with no warning, no discussion, and no reason. Not a bad place to start your career Not a bad place to start your career, but it can be tough to advance and get promoted. If you can get on a diversity of projects you will probably enjoy working here. Great place to work, Great pay I loved this job, I was working in manufacturing. Loved the people I worked with a loved the work. great environment, laid back, but productive. Great company! Great project but terrible managment Dupont schedule, 12 hour rotating shifts. Great pay but advancement is only given to friends of management. There is definitely a good ol boy system within the company. Pay Everything else Research Company with a tradition of giving back Battelle is a nice company to work for that does a lot for the community and for the country. You can feel really proud to work for this organization. Lower level managers are really good, and the work done throughout the organisation means that there are always new things to learn. An organization of dedicated people that is struggling to develop new markets A generally positive working environment in a non-profit with a legacy of research and service to the community. The company is trying to address its shortcomings in terms of employee recognition and appreciation. The organization has a core set of strengths but is struggling to reach beyond them into to new markets. High turnover is stripping away experienced staff. 9/80 schedule = every other Friday off Managers have too many direct reports to actually support them Constant Growing Pains It is still a leader in the research and development space but has consistent struggles to stay profitable. There are frequent reductions in force due to the lack of reliable strategic market projections and line of sight of accountability for meeting goals. A good entry level position for new graduates but low potential for growth. The culture at Battelle is one of constant work that keeps you engaged for the majority of the day. However there is little room for growth unless you are at the main offices and labs in Ohio. The 9-80 schedule of 9 days in 2 weeks to get 80 hrs of work is nice but makes the 5 day weeks feel longer. Overall a solid starting position for new graduates looking to get real life experience. Good ole boys network rampant with nepotism and bullies Company & management did absolutely nothing to address my complaints of being bullied for nearly 1 year, including Diversity & Inclusion, Workplace Concerns or HR. There was no investigation, the published harassment policy was not followed. It was, however, revised and the bullying continued, worsened and increased to include retaliation each time I attempted to get someone to address the issue. company with severe employee satisfaction issue company is attempting to increase employee satisfaction but is so behind industry standard that the processes is years from completion. Management is not supportive. somewhat flexible hours understaffed so hours are long Cafe that they have is fantastic. The people there are nice and polite. Not sure about the security as there are a lot of contractors there. Never know what management is going to do before hand. Clean work enviroment Great company,good coworkers,clean work environment,flexible management,the only downside I see is waiting to become an employee of battelle not a contractor. Great work place Excellent all around. Management is very easy to work with. They are willing to work around your schedule. Highly recommend this company for anyone looking to advance in their career. Good paying. Still rebuilding and rebuilding slowly. Good place to work. PPO And other health care insurers costly. Usually 1/4 to 1/3 of weekly pay. Costly spousal coverage fee. All OT you want. Not stingy on lab supplies. Pay Healthcare cost. Not a bad company It is a stressful position to work on contracts as a consultant. Battelle overcharges for their work by comparison, which puts a lot of stress on the employees to over-deliver on the hours available to work on a project. Rewarding Mission and Company Battelle is a great place to work and grow. They offer a 9x80 schedule, flexible working hours, and every employee makes a difference each and every day. Tread cautiously The trick to staying employed is to survive your 90 day probation period. Be careful of what you say bc it'll show up on your review word for word. High turnover. Large corporation with a small business mindset Professional staff & highly supportive for employee success. Many locations across the company and several career fields to choose from. Opportunity for growth. NEON great place to start NEON is only as good as the manager you work for. The eastern offices have their stuff together more than the western. Texas office is a great place to work at - no drama, fulfilling work, better pay than most. You get what you put in - there's not a lot of room for advancement unless you move states, so use the opportunity to network and learn new skills to help you land the next job Great place for research, but not much else. If you thought that you were going to climb the ladder and advance in your organization, the only way is if your managers literally die. Those at the top seem to prevent any kid of advancement and barely compensate those who work hard. A good place to start. As an intern I've primarily completed data management projects but have been exposed to lots of different topics. I wish more support was given to interns but it will vary based on department. Overall, a good experience. Good people and the overall culture and environment was nice. Great environment for aspiring ecologists NEON is a good place to get a start doing field biology/data collection, regardless of previous experience. You get to work alongside a group of highly motivated and passionate individuals in an outdoor setting, in some really beautiful places. I came away with new knowledge of New England flora and fauna, as well as confidence for following scientific procedures. Not bad People are great, money needs to be a little higher. Every weekend off with a three day weekend every other. Great retirement, insurance is good as well. Good compensation for the cost of living in this area. It is a desirable place to work, the compensation is great for the area. Mostly comprised of prior Demilitarization experience and locals of the area. Great project but terrible managment Dupont schedule, 12 hour rotating shifts. Great pay but advancement is only given to friends of management. There is definitely a good ol boy system within the company. Pay Everything else Enjoyable people to work with. Worked well as a team. Projects were as expected with normal challenges. The department was well organized and did a good job meeting the defined objectives. 2 2 Professional work environment and wonderful staff. The work place is filled with intelligent and motivated individuals. Great place to begin an entry level position in the ecological sciences. Lots of hiking and hands on experience. Low pay 1 Not bad but not great Company leaves a lot to be desired. I was very excited to start working there but after I'd been there for about 4 months, my mood began to sour. Hard to bring it around when every complaint I have is a challenge I need to figure out a solution to. dred Did not like it. don't buy into the hype. Let down by the manager, nothing I did was right. Made a lot of changes to documents that could have be done correctly if instructed in the beginning. Thumbs down. Great place to work The people here are amazingly talented people. I learned so much during my internship here. Great work-life balance. The work is a lot but not a stressful environment to work in, Used to be a good place to work I used to love working for Battelle. I worked for Battelle for 13 years. The atmosphere and overall management style has drastically changed. They cut departments and groups based on limited data. They laid off many of the best, most experienced scientists, to save money. This caused significant issues on programs I worked on. This is not a great strategy when Battelle's entire business is based on the skills and experience of its employees. The management does not listen to the working level employees if they don't like what they are saying, then wonder why our latest projects are such a mess. The atmosphere has become toxic. Battelle is a great company! I've worked for Battelle for several years now. I base my assessment off of the 5-6 other organizations I've worked in; Battelle is by far the best company and this is the best job I've have had in my career. The Cyber group is simply incredible with the creme of the crop talent. Management is great and the culture is positive and energetic. The mission of Battelle is unmatched. If you have the opportunity to work for Battelle, absolutely jump on the opportunity. Solid Company Battelle it’s a good science technical engineering and innovative company. I’m not sure that any of the problems they have or any of the successes they have are any different than any other large company whose revenue stream is mostly from the federal government Good pay and benefits Have yet to fully decide what they want to be never a repetitive day every day something new happens. fun place for a flexible person to work. CHances to be at the forefront of scientific discovery and to be helping fund the next generation of scientists. High stress environment Several managers like to micromanage employees to the point of creating a highly charged, very stressful working environment. If employees do not become ""yes men"" to these managers, they are shunned and given only menial tasks to perform on a daily basis. Nice Place to Work Fair pay and good benefits. Most of the people were great. Management was fair to good depending on the individual. Working hours were 10 per day plus two hour travel. Really depends on where you are at/what contract you are on. I know a lot of people that work for Battelle at other national labs or on other contracts that are very happy, but they took over the contract I was on and treated us horribly. The benefits are completely trash, no where near what the rest of the industry provides. The managers they brought would lie and throw anyone under the bus they could. No response to issues at all. When I had a problem with my pay check, every manager and payroll person I talked to agreed I wasn't paid correctly, but no one wanted to/knew how fix the issue. lack of benefits, unresponsive unreliable managers Initially a great place to work but working conditions have deteriorated dramatically. When I started back in 1978 it was a fabulous place to work. Projects were very interesting and management was very supportive. Toward the end of my tenure working conditions deteriorated dramatically in a company run by contractors . Management was only interested in cutting costs and did little to bring in new contracts. Clean facilities. Long hours. Good Company Good company going through a change. Can be a lot of pressure to bring in work and stay billable. There is a resistance to change inside the organization which the new management is working to change, but it's a slow process. Confusing and ambiguous contracting job Confusing and ambiguous co reacting job. Very nice management but no room for lateral movement or job placement after contract ends. Very unclear as to what you’re getting into and once you land at the military base/project group you’re basically assigned to whatever job they need filled. The job description IS NOT AT ALL what the job is. Great place to work The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory operated by Battelle Memorial Institute is a great place to work because of the Science & National Security work done there. Able to set your own hours. Battelle has begun to require that everyone who works there needs to have a degree. Great place to gain exposure to a variety of technical work Great place to gain exposure to a wide variety of technical work. Environment for technical employee is somewhat like freelancing in that you network and market yourself to be hired to work on the projects that interest you; though this may be changing now. Variety of work, talented people Admin tasks associate with Govt contracting This was a stressful job working in the field as a field interviewer This study was somewhat difficult trying to convince African Americans 40 years old and older to an inteivew which took about an hour and then schedule them to have a free comprehensive eye exam and if they agreed to take the exam they would receive a $50 gift card. This job took patience and perseverance. The most enjoyable part is meeting some of the nicest people. Meeting a variety of different people Trying to convince people the importance of having their eyes examined No support from management I was working on several DoD contracts. When the contracts expired, almost all of us were laid off. Management made no attempt to find us new work and were busy making sure their positions were covered. The future is bright at this interesting and important non-profit You learn something new on the job almost every day at Battelle. The people are some of the smartest in the world, the work is exciting and important and the mission is to develop new technologies to make the world a better and safer place. It really is a very special place to work. The non-profit aspect allows Battelle to invest in its people and their ideas, which is demonstrated in their history of incredible scientific breakthroughs and R&D awards. If you want to do important scientific research that has real-world benefit, Battelle is your place. Higher than average salary"
Visa| Good environment & teams Learning and growth opportunities, fair salary, international people & openings. Strong internal growth culture. Very political at times. Reasonable hours. Good work life balance Good work like balance, good culture, supportive manager. One of the best 401k and insurance benefit. Really enjoying working here. Nothing to complain. Amazing place to work, not super competitive with compensation Visa is a great place to work. They have an amazing work life balance. The compensation is not the best, but if you can work around that it's amazing. Very good environment to work. It is a very good environment to work and provides excellent benefits. Management is very helpful and coworkers are very nice. I loved to work at Visa. stay away No chance for growth. Difficult to reach out to manager and upper management regarding opportunities. Will not recommend to anyone. Too much red tape. Company like any other company Don't dream when you work at VISA. Have your luggage ready at anytime, you can be put out from the company even if you have go through 100 training's. Good WLB, Less compensation If you get into write team, Visa is a good company. It is great in WLB. However, it lacks a lot in compensation side. Company has a mindset of FinTech rather than technology company being in Financial services. It does have very challenging problems on time to time. But, lack of innovation is the big problem. Great place to Work This company offers Excellent benefits and pay. It also has Great diversity and inclusion. They also Offer a lot of fantastic benefits for continuing education if you want to go that route. Also, you can move around to different positions within the organization. I highly recommend working for Visa as it offers long term stability. Not a good place to work in Agile development is a joke without professional TPMs Manager is micromanaging and pushing and suppose you to work 12hrs a day like a machine without eating and drinking Environment is toxic and will burn out all your passion and positive energy Productive and fun place with big cafe and video games room Productive and fun place with big cafe and video games room. Management deeply cares about personal life/work balance. It's a fun company to work with. Excelente cultura, excelentes beneficios Sin lugar a duda una compañía con una excelente cultura, buen salario y excelentes beneficios. If you're in the call center, you basically can't get out There was a lot of favoritism, depending on who you had as a manager. Which could work in your favor. Horrible hours, and once you chose a shift you got stuck with it. Even if they promised that you could change it after 6 months - 1 year of working there. At first this job was very enjoyable, but over time it was the worst. People would be trained to take calls for other departments, since they would be short staffed. Turn over was high. Managers would guilt you if they needed you to come in if they were understaffed. They rarely took calls if there was just 2-3 people there. Excellent benefits short breaks, understaffed Great place Great place to work with supportive boss and colleagues. Good exposure to payment systems, Great connections to the users and internal departments. Good benefits. Great all around culture, however, compensation should be better for entry-level employees Overall, your experience at Visa entirely depends on the team you're on. However, the common theme is that management is actively listening to concerns up to a certain executive level (i.e C-Suite level executive). Tools provided for the job(tech, software, access) are pretty great and easy to request. The worst part is unfortunately the compensation. Visa does a great job at recruiting entry-level employees but does offer below-the-average salary compensation for APMs and Sr. APMs compared to other fintechs. From great to gone Visa is an innovative, interesting company that at its core really does thrive because of its diverse employee landscape. Up until my last year or so, I had had wonderful managers who recognized peoples’ talents, then took the time to work with them to allow for maximum contribution. I’d consider returning but would avoid certain departments whose cultures have become too self-serving. Great company I love working for visa, they have pretty good compensation and my teammates are awesome. My manager is incredible. The work is hard though, they expect a lot. Pay, coworkers. Demanding Work and get paid Pays well although the work life balance is based off your seniority and position within the company. Visa’s culture is overall positive and encouraging for individuals to strive for their goals. 3 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Work life balance Learn about payments What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Low growth opportunities Slow to innovate Easy to get comfortable Pros: Stable job, hard to perform poorly, tons of flexibility and work life balance Cons: low pay, that is worse the longer you stay, too much work on too few people, sometimes hard to find good times to use pto. Wonderful benefits and pay, not so understanding at times I actually love my job with Visa, the pay, the benefits, etc are amazing. I have had some unexpected health issues and had to have surgery and missed a significant amount of days because of this but things are better now after surgery but I feel like management are not as understanding as I expected. Pay and benefits Need more empathy Great place Lots of great benefits but working from home is one of the best. Good support and paid time off as well. Insurance options are good and you have plenty of opportunities to advance Good environment & teams Learning and growth opportunities, fair salary, international people & openings. Strong internal growth culture. Very political at times. Reasonable hours. Good job Working there was great a lot of support from management. I did not like the scheduling hours all evening and every weekend. The pay was great and lots of training. Good stability Great work/life balance and benefits are good. Would expect more of a brand name like Visa. Everything inside is not organized and still very manual. They lie Stay away go anywhere else they lie so they can get rid of at all costs. No chance at all to explain your side or anything.just go else where and visa can put u know where Great ping pong I was impressed during my time at Visa. The company culture and management style was both manageable and flexible. I improved my work life balance and was able to move through the ranks very quickly. Visa has great benefits but it is process heavy company. Visa has great benefits but it is process heavy company. Also, Visa is slow in adopting new technologies. No public cloud is used in production. Private cloud is lacking new features. Fine Feels slow and old. no room for innovation. lots of middle management just wasting away their time. If you value growth / experience, I would look elsewhere It was ight It was allright but there was a lot of red tape and hard to get momentum for projects. Sloppy code an and bad direction from high up leadership. Lots of stress and deadlines. Toxic company to work with #Highly political and toxic culture #No work life balance #Expected to work 12hours everyday #Expected to work on all weekends #low pay, below industry standard Great place with ping pong Nice place to work at. A bit gossipy but low key. Good learning experience about credit card processing. People are nice and some folks were above and beyond helpful. Great place to work Visa has been one of the best companies I’ve worked for. Great company with very good benefits. A lot support of managers and career development opportunities. Great Ceo Benefits, salary productive and fun workplace with a pool table Working there is awesome so many nice coworkers and customers. you get long breaks and the managers are always looking out for the best interest of the employee, efficient workplace and and enjoyable environment free lunch long hours Stressful and painful There is no work and family or life balance at all. Work pressure is too much. No strong management or process. Just requirement comes and have to work on it. Free snacks and coffee Too much work for the pay Great WLB & Supportive team I have been working at Visa for 6 years now and over years i can say Visa has great WLB and teams here are very supportive. job security will always be there as long as you have a good reputation and if you are performing well. Great WLB & supportive team Compensation is fairly poor Fun workplace, great to work with technology Very fun work environment. Nice and friendly staff and customers are always a delight to serve. One hundred percent recommended to anyone looking for a job. Dinosaur culture but good benefits and not too stressful Come here if you want to coast, not great for learning and the company in general tends to be a bit dysfunctional due to the organizational structure. Good company to work A secure job with a good work-life balance. Good if you have kids who need a life with decent pay. Management is good, caring, and supportive. Work can challenging but depends on the group you work for. Internal promotions are a joke On the surface Visa makes a big deal about moving within the company, but in reality the only people that move up in ranks are those who have close ties to leadership. I had seen people getting promoted to management positions that had absolutely 0 relatable experience, and what is worst is that they emulated the micromanaging techniques of their leader that got them in that position. Lower benefit costs to employees, 401k immediate vesting Micromanaging All fun, except it isn't Visa culture is at odds with itself, trying to accomplish goals that undermine its own policies. It's a fractured company stuck between what they were that made them great, and what they want to be in the emerging leviathan that is global finance. Ping Pong You spend every day making the world a darker place. Benefits are Good The benefits are good at Visa, but it is very hard to advance if you don't work in the right location. There is a lot of turnover. So, if you want a career, I would look elsewhere. Healthcare Few Opportunities Golden Chains I worked 60 and 70 hour weeks in a high paced and high pressure work environment. Working with sums of money and transaction volumes that monumentally large is inherently stressful. There is no room for mistakes. They are one of the few companies that I have worked for that take data security very seriously, and rightly so. I've seen them terminate someone for not following the rules to secure his laptop. The benefits were so good that you wouldn't want to leave. At least that was how it was some years ago. Do you want to be a big fish in a little pond? Or grow to be a huge fish in the ocean? High bar, fast paced, great pay, great bennifits. You are never off the clock. Good environment & teams Learning and growth opportunities, fair salary, international people & openings. Strong internal growth culture. Very political at times. Reasonable hours. Chill job is you're aiming for retirement Good wlb but not good pay, dinosaur tech, too many red tapes, slow process, average coworkers. But has 200% 401k matching which is unheard of in the industry so if you just wanna coast along and rest and vest its the place for you Wlb Pay 3 1 Great environment, great people Great management, a technically superior facility, where you always have opportunity to learn. Cooperative culture in the department I was in, and we had the ability to be creative in our field. Excellent benefits, and supportive management Demanding environment High expectations- horrible experience Bar none the worst company I've worked for. You're a number that can be let go anytime. Understaffed, lack of communication, training wasn't sufficient, heavy on management. Free meals occasionally. Free drinks Micromanagement on steroids, culture was awful Fun Place to work Loved working here! Management is great, executives would talk to you and bring you in on their projects. Austin breach would have all kinds of events, they made the Christmas party great and memorable. Environment, challenging work, Peers Not many Great place to work Great place to work and learn the industry. Decent benefits and good colleagues make good culture. Latetal move is possible with right network and mgr being supportive Benefits None Very siloed and difficult to get things done there VISA is all about transaction processing. If you work in that area it is very innovative. I worked in a different part of the organization and was often stymied by both the legal culture (the joke is: At Legal we put the NO in innovation) and a senior culture that would be hard to get the attention of. Good work life balance. Pays good and stock has been lucrative Very siloed. Difficult to get anything innovative through the system Ok job, does not care about employees Ok place to work. You are very expendable but benefits are good. It can be very stressful at times and management is of little help. The upside is the office is very nice and the company has many nice people. Benefits Stressful, too demanding, you are expendable innovation, culture, benefits. I was in a role that was poorly defined and managed. My on boarding was only 3 days rather than 2 weeks, and I was not properly introduced to any of the stakeholders I would be working and collaborating with. Not a culture of transparency, rather a lot of sweeping the elephant in the room under the rug. Very little leadership accountability Great Company in Growing Industry Great industry to work for especially with the growth of Open Banking and exposure to the Fintech environment. The company is seeking to continuously reinvent itself to keep growing. Good Pay, Great Benefits Very hierarchical Structure, Personal Growth is slow, Unclear Career Paths Na Stressful at times. Good benefits but got worse over the years. Too many layoffs happening and feel unstable working for visa. Visa however did good job at doing remote work during covid Na Na Drives you to do better The team is collaborative and fun to be with. It feels like a 2nd family as they understand your strengths and weaknesses. Also, honest feedback is provided at every stage. And that has been a strong foundation in my growth. A place for people to coast If you want to make a living at a company that isn’t going anywhere for the next decade or two, you are willing to deal with really poor politics, and you don’t mind some nonsensical decisions with reasonable pay, it’s just fine. Your experience will vary widely depending on your leader and if you fit in with what the leadership looks like (look up a picture). Growing your career here is the equivalent of having someone pay you to help grow theirs. You’ll know what the important things are based upon the money they throw at the problem internally, not for show externally. Know the difference. Usually reasonable work hours, a few exceptional coworkers Lip service, lack of growth, lack of vision Great place to work if you have the right manager and team. Working at Visa has had it's up and downs. The culture is great especially with a pandemic. The hardest part of my job is getting communications from my team, the most enjoyable part is the employees. Work from home, benefits, people Communication Latest technology but not much advancement ops Worked in a support role for 5+ years, and enjoyed being part of such a well-known company. Wasn't encouraged to advance career-wise, and not seriously considered for roles above what I was doing. I got the sense that they didn't want to lose people in the department rather than promote. Benefits, latest technology Pay, lack of advancement, trainging It was a great place I was with visa for 8 years and it was a great company to work for. When they switched directors it became very different and not as great! U get burnt out with the calls and their ridiculous numbers that we needed to meet, But I learned alot there and the people I met were all pretty cool. Productive all inclusive workplace. Diversity was top priority. Great place to work, everyone worked as a team. I loved working there. Great compensation, good managers, excellent all around. Inclusive environment, we were all family. Well defined goals, if you tried your best, the sky was the limit. Free meals, popcorn, movie tickets, team spirit. Really fun and creative ways to motivate employees Reasonable breaks and lunch. Benefits are top-notch, health insurance, 401K, Pto. Good work environment Visa is a good company for who wants to settle down and run really slow for their day to day work, Overall good experience but not for everyone who is looking grow fast hated it, they treat you like shut they treat you like shut, they won't let you grow AT ALL. Human Resources is the worst department here. Management is AWFUL. When you start you think you're working for a huge company which will help you grow, but is ALL LIES, they environment is toxic, personally speaking. Terrible experience. Great Place to work Visa is a great place to work in if you find the right team and the right manager . The culture seems dynamic if you get those 1st 2 right otherwise you find yourself locked down with no room for growth. Benefits Finding the right team Great Opportunity Great opportunity for someone who is looking for an entry level position in customer service. I learned a lot there and made really good friends!!!!! Good environment & teams Learning and growth opportunities, fair salary, international people & openings. Strong internal growth culture. Very political at times. Reasonable hours. Secure job but with no clear vision for success Joined looking to help out as much as I could, by introducing new methods to solve for problems. My management didn't care to hear about them, they just wanted it done the same way it's always been done. Got tired of that mentality and left after a year. Also, my director would have no problem calling me after work hours to ask me to hop on the computer and do some work, this happened at least once a week. Good Pay lack of vision, no boundaries 3 Overemphasis on diversity now. They discriminate against non diverse employees now. women or diverse employees are being promoted or compensated now. Most of the time the person being promoted is strictly based on the color of their skin or gender. A lot of unqualified people being given roles they have no experience with. Visa is a data breach waiting to happen now due to unqualified/inexperienced leaders now. Visa will be the next equifax in the next few years. The EEOC should heavily lookin into the hiring practices here. Manage my is dictating only certain gender or races be granted interviews. There are aggressive hiring quotas for diverse hires. Additionally, compensation is tied to managers meeting these quotas which just encourages the practice. If you want to work at a wasteful, no skill, nothing is efficient company. Visa is your place. The President and CTO are borderline incompetent. The CTO told us he was only there till apple or another company came along and offered him large salary. It’s laughable the people they have at this company. Visa is only a brand, not a technology company. Awful management from mid level to the CEO. 5 2 Productive and fun place to work - Great culture and people - Free snacks - Hard-working and professional environment - A transparent leadership team that puts the employees first. - Given freedom and agency over your own work/study. - Flexible wfh and office hours n/a n/a Do not take care of their hardworkers It is not a good place to grow in your professional career, look for something else. Too many changes all the time, VISA do not offer a stable job, run away! Benefits like many other companies No life balance, management favoritism, work is not assigned equally Verifi, Inc. HR and some management need to be replaced. Not ran like a business. If you are not part of their circle you will be targeted. HR falsifies personnel records. HR and Payroll Visa is an incredible company to work for. They truly value their employees and want to make their life and work and home a positive experience. The benefits packages are amazing and no where else compares. Very structured and slow moving. Worked for some middle management that only cared about what they needed upper management wanted things but had no trouble freezing everything during COVID but still wanted progress. Finished the contract period and was let go as if nothing happened. Most employees I talked too in my position were trying to get out of there. Nice offices and work spaces, great cafe and break rooms Parking sucks very slow hierarchical setup disconnected environment a lot politics. very toxic team competition. management only care about covering up their rears clean so they wont end up in trouble. my advice to anyone, stay away... Sr Implementation Analyst I enjoy my job at Visa. I feel incredibily valued and I enjoy my manager and team. They are extremely flexible and the culture is excellent. I think our CEO is amazingly supportive. Just a great place to work with people from many different ethnicities. A world class office offering its employees all the tools to succeed in the work environment. The trainers are wonderful and management cares about their employees Supportive management heard good things about VisaNet and data product team, they are quite laid back. My team is under data product, I enjoy flexible work hour and the supportive management. Expect to work with some legacy code if you are not on the AI team, Visa is a well-established company and products are built on top of many existing infrastructure. Turn around, then run as fast as you can The juice is not worth the squeeze. They can't pay you enough to make up for the poison that a moronic layer of middle management forces down your gullet every day. Good internship experience Had a very supportive manager who focused on my career interests and development, and the internship program focused on making sure interns had a great experience and good work-life balance Productive Work Place, Fun and Loving Team Productive Work Place, will learn new technologies, Fun and Loving Team. Be patient with the re-orgs and everything will eventually fall in place. Great people to work with and everyone is welcomed One of the best companies in the SF Bay Area. Very good life and work balance. Amazing team leaders and co-workers caring each other. If you're doing your job right, you will be respected by peers. Super stable company There are negatives to every company, but at Visa, stability is huge. The brand is key and it's value speaks for itself. The culture has changed since I left there, so I can't speak to the current culture, but compensation was always more than fair. workplace I really love the environment, made a good friends and I learned a lot of things. The hardest part at work was the call volume, I received more than 100 call daily Enjoyed working with Visa learn so Many things, Management is very helpful. Happy to work again the future, mentors, colleagues are kind and supportive. Pros Best Company compare to others best in salary ,work time, Holidays , promotions , paper less work 70% work is easy full digital nice to work here Cons no petroll allowance i hope in future petroll allowance will be start Good solid stable company with a lot of future OVerall - very good company to work for. Solid track record. Business model isn’t going anywhere. Leadership has a good strategy and an Execution mindset with a lot of BOD buy in...hence there is executive sponsorship. Good Benefits and Flexible hours. Everyone helps each other succeed.Good Salary.Cool company activities.You learn something new everyday. Clean workplace.Good leaders and amazing training equipment. Good environment & teams Learning and growth opportunities, fair salary, international people & openings. Strong internal growth culture. Very political at times. Reasonable hours. enjoyable work environment At visa you have a large space you can demonstrate your skills and abilities. It is very large organisation and many communications, different time zones etc. manager are positive and give a good direction. Work Flexibility Visa is always focus on the quality of the work rather than the quantity and managers always concentrate on the work flexibility. One can work in visa with full freedom and flexibility.I enjoyed my work. VISA is a very nice place to work VISA is a very nice place to work and has very encouraging employees which I really love. VISA uses cutting edge technologies which is good for employee to improve latest technologies. Productive and very nice building with excerise room Take calls as soon as you clock in, learned different software. Management was not to good. Good co-workers. Do get alot of people yelling at you on a daily basis. Had alot of vacation time and sick time but can't take it when you need it, it was horrible trying to get time off. QA was to picky and try to tell you what to say word per word and that is not good when you conversations are different with every person. Enjoyed helping people get the answers they were looking for. nice building and excerise room Can't take the time off you need, even if you have the time to take. Collaborative environment Great workplace culture. Supportive environment. Global team members are always ready to help and back each other up. Great collaborative environment. Management and employee Management was amazing to no end and the employee was very respectfully.. everyone was on the same page regardless of what it was.. this employer is a visa good company Very productive environment Enjoyed the culture and the flexible work hours and the work life balance is good. The management is accessible and are down to earth people. Learned the new stuff such as Visa Tokenization that is used by different customers to perform their transactions. Learned how the Apple Pay & Google Pay flow works in the financial transactions domain. Great people with great culture and flexible working hours were very positive for me. Productive and fast paced Nice location for work. The environment here is fast paced depending on the team that you are part of. I had a short contractual project which did not allow me enough time to learn more. productive and friendly place with onsite gym. Managers help employees to reach the goal of customer satisfaction. Every incoming call has to be answered within 5 seconds of time and the international and national customers' scores has to be as high as 95%and above. We had good compensation, good breaking time, benefits, and bonus. Employees were friendly and cared about each other, very good atmosphere. Productive and good work place • Assisting in migration from the LDoS Cisco (IOS and NXOS) devices to new Arista hardware (EOS) for access and distribution layer switches and routers • Work on decommissioning of LDoS (last day of service) devices like routers and switches to mitigate security violations and vulnerabilities in multiple data centers distributed globally Love my Team I love this company and my team. They are understanding, and Visa takes great pride in providing the best environment possible for their employees. They are flexible and work with their employees, where managers are able to manage and the job is able to get done. Great teams, dedicated employees Having worked on a variety of projects I found most coworkers were collaborative and willing to share knowledge and help understand the challenges of the tools we were building. Not the best or the worst place to work. Visa used to be a fun place to work with lots of opportunities but that is no longer the case. Over the years as business increased so did the need to hire more employees with led to questionable hires. That along with poor leadership has led to a decrease in performance. Experienced, positive, and dedicated people in a casual, friendly office environment The people at Visa are great to work with and the technical work is challenging and interesting. The office culture is casual, hard working, and friendly. Great place to work at in general but some teams can be difficult Worked in various teams in Visa. My first team and manager were amazing and I loved it there. Work culture is definitely better in some locations than others. Work is challenging is most teams. A lot of fun activities Welcoming and respectful company The company is very inclusive and diverse. The benefits are great and the management is always available. A very positive point about Visa is that it pushes its employees to develop and evolve, offering vast learning programs, classes internally and externally. Productive and Fun place Good place to learn and have fun. Supportive Team mates Lots of opportunities Flexible working schedule.. Good Higher Management Team Free coffee !!! Fair all around company Majority of the managers there build a personal bond with you! If your schedule doesn’t meet your need you can always count on them to assist you with your hours. Inovative company with a heart for the consumer Loved it. Learned a lot which made me want to contribute more. Working for a global company with a diverse team made life exciting. The world is growing smaller everyday and my experience at Visa prepared me for the global community Amazing Place to Work Great compensation, great places to work, and passionate, hands-on management. The people make the place - from the best and brightest in the industry, to just generally lovely people who make it a great place to come to work every day.
Apple|" The Best Job Ever Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public. The store was always electric, although others may say crazy. I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating. The managers were all great and they were never above doing what they asked of their employees. The benefits and pay were amazing for a part time job. Working for a company with a brand such as Apple and experience to match that brand made me want to stay forever. This is a job I truly miss and I am thankful for the opportunity that I was given! Work environment Parking 43 17 Productive and fun Productive and fun. Flexible with school. Competitive pay and benefits for part time and full time. Good place to get your foot in the door for a job in tech. Best Job I Ever had An amazing work environment, lovely people everyone is so friendly and caring, they never work you to hard, very caring of all employees, great benefits, paid time off, was never a stressful job and they are big on making sure you have a good work life, home life balance Ok work Typical day at work is ok What I learned was ok Management ok Workplace culture good The hardest part of the job was hard The most enjoyable part of the job was holiday Great Place to work Loved the food and the work was very rewarding, I got to succeed in a high agency environment that made me feel supported every step of the way. Five stars 4 stars What is the best part of working at the company? There is good people working Apple. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? During quarterly audit it can get stressful, with the work load. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Very productive and professional. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Good work load and busy days, which makes time go by fast. cool place to work cant really complain apple is a cool place to work if you drink the cool laid. you can defiantly get promoted if you work hard. its very diverse and you meet great people. rsu's, bonuses, hourly management hours, schedules, workload A nice work environment Apple is a great place to work! From day one they can’t stress enough how important you are as a person who works there. I just wish I could have been a better fit for the position I applied and worked for. Attentive and stable It was great. The schedule was good. The management was very understanding. It was fun and very engaging work environment. Their training was very good. long hours Long hours, pay is okay. customer satisfaction survey is unrealistic. But its a pretty decent job if you want to work from home. you are mandated to move up from iPhone support to the Mac Department with no pay increase, pay increase comes after a year with being with the company. Productive and Funwork place I love working here! I love the opportunities you can get while working here! Apple has me for LIFE. It’s great. I would definitely recommend anyone hesitant to apply to DO IT. I don’t have ANY regrets at ALL. Fun place Good place to work good for students ? Very flexible no issues. Managers do work with you so it’s a good job . I do 3 days of school and work 2 days. A fun place to work at . Not a bad job at all Helping people fix their phone/laptop issues was nice. All of the callers were very nice, I only had one bad call. Management needs work. Cafeteria was BOMB and coworkers were cool. Great overall experience at the BCC store Worked at apple for a total of 4 years! In general it’s a great company to work for, the health insurance benefits are so good for even part-time employees. It’s probably one of the easiest retail stores to work at for sure. Remote contract work was awesome besides the pay Overall the job was great working remote was awesome and we did a lot of cool stuff. Only problem was the staffing company, who was hard to get ahold of at times and somewhat exaggerated the potential to move into a full time role. Biggest issue was the low pay rate and inability to get a raise even after years in the position. I would have loved to stay if I could have even gotten a cost of living adjustment after 3+ years. Seems they would rather constantly train new people instead of paying people who perform well to stick around. cool work, flexible hours, awesome coworkers low pay, contractors treated as replaceable Busy but very stressful No work/life balance. Pays better than most retail jobs but as a tech not paid enough for all we have to do. Management gaslighting and clear favoritism for advancement. People aren’t hired for their skills anymore. All the new techs have no technical experience or understanding of troubleshooting even after training. They only template match. Benefits are good. Discounts are good. Used to be a good place to work now it’s only about meeting metrics for iphones Workplace Great place to work, supportive and benefits are great. They were so supportive during Covid times. Understandable mangers and leaders. Great place to be Fun and with good pay and benefits but with a catch. If you need a good paying job with great benefits and decent flexibility this is your place! So far I have worked in two different locations (one in NYC the other out of state). Your experience will vary depending on your market. At my previous location out market leader made everything as transactional as possible and metrics were of the upmost importance. If you were not selling X, Y, and Z then you were not doing a good job. To clarify, Apple employees DO NOT work on commission. It is an hourly pay job! With that said, depending on your reviews (customers can give you reviews in their email receipts) and your metrics that does play into your compensation. So it’s not commission based but you really want to hit all of their marks to insure that you can have the best pay boost possible. My current location in NYC is better in terms of culture and what the market leader wants. It’s very easy going though the pay could definitely be higher for NYC cost of living (honestly the biggest strike I have for this location). Give it a shot! Something to try out. Busy Busy none stop! Customer are rude occasionally! Be prepared for being only judge by surveys from customers. The support from managers was the best part and keeps you going Overall a good company too work for. Ever changing fast paced environment filled with small daily challenges. Great benefits, decent discounts, and you must be a people person to work there. It's about the people, not the technology. fun workplace apple is great, they do support you if you want to go another career path. the benefits are great for full time employee. they also give you some money for going to school. working weekends The Best Job Ever Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public. The store was always electric, although others may say crazy. I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating. The managers were all great and they were never above doing what they asked of their employees. The benefits and pay were amazing for a part time job. Working for a company with a brand such as Apple and experience to match that brand made me want to stay forever. This is a job I truly miss and I am thankful for the opportunity that I was given! Work environment Parking 43 17 Great place to work, management dependent Apple all in all is a great place to work. I learn so much while working there, and meet so many great people. Management is both great, and terrible depending on management drive. Apple says its all about the people, but care so much about their AppleCare statistics its hard to truly believe that that is true. Great environment with high energy Work-life balance Great place The best I was doing a lot of breaks Co works are so nice and friendly I did nothing Fun thing was to chill Was come to work make a coffee going at my desk to chill A great job to work from home Loved working for this company the time I did. They also do a test before you are chosen. You will get paid good for training but there is this test at the end that will determine whether you will actually start working . Best job I ever had. Apple is the best employer I have ever had the pleasure to work for. Competitive pay rates, fantastic work environment. The only reason I am seeking new employment is to take the skills I have learned and increase my pay rate. Brilliant people, fun work environment The team I worked with was amazing. The health benefits, dental insurance, vision insurance, were all the best of any company I’ve worked for. They occasionally offered stocks, covered adoption fees, and offered amazing discounts on Apple products. Great Overall All the great benefits you expect from a huge multi billion/trillion company, career progress depends on you and your eagerness, some departments are easier than others. Great work place I enjoyed my tenure there. It was a bit challenging at first, but it was enjoyable and the people they were great. Working for hermit was fun and rewarding. Great Company , great benefits, Great culture and diversity , Heavy Metrics based, High Call Volume Apple culture is unique and very diverse. Most managers are pretty laid back but still focused on goals in a good way. Call volume is very high w/ back to back calls every 7 secs w/ rare occasions of larger breaks in between. High technical job w/ alot of multi tasking and they are heavy on metrics. Very good on work accommodations if needed and coworkers are very caring. Nice charity donation matching, great tuition assistance , 401 K, super amazing insurance rates and coverage, PTO, sick time, etc. Great learning environment with all the tools you need to learn available to you. Opportunity to advance and grow as you move along from T1 to T2 etc. Great coworkers who help you grow and great managers w/ the exception of my last manager. Under her leadership 3 of us quit including myself but my other 3 managers before her were beyond amazing. Alot of room for growth and pay is very good but sometimes feel its too little with all the brain power thats needed to troubleshoot Apple devices especially on complicated calls. Some calls are super easy versus others but you never know what kind of call you will get. Some calls are super difficult and customers can get pretty upset when their apple devices do not work. Overall its a call center type job so alot of this stuff is expected but overall I will say it was an amazing experience and outstanding company to work for.. by far the best one I ever been apart of in my opinion. Not so good IT wasn't that bad but sometimes you need to do what the leaders ask you to do even if its not your own leader . Other leaders think they are the bosses. Fun environment The manager and fellow workers are extremely nice and friendly. Work is pretty easy and they give you time to train so that way when you get to the floor you know what you’re talking about and the products you are trying to sell. Great company to work for. When it comes to working retail, few employers compare to Apple. The company provides excellent pay and benefits, as well as a diverse and dynamic work environment. Compensation. Benefits. Culture. Rude and degrading customers. Fun workplace I made a lot of great friends at this place that I still talk to after leaving. It a great place to work they have great benefits and pay is awesome for retail. Love the people, environment taxing I’ve loved working here, met some of my best friends here. The work can be rewarding, but it’s retail. At the end of the day, despite great benefits (health insurance is amazing), it’s still retail. No advancement In the remote field working for Apple, it's almost impossible to advance. You can switch around between departments but advancing is very slim. There's almost no room to grow. In 7 years, I've had more than 7 managers. I've had managers just hired that didn't really know about a department, managers that were amazing and supportive and managers that were just careless. They have great benefits and the pay is fare but raises are almost nothing so after a few years you don't really see a difference in pay. Schedules are picked by bids which are based on performance. However, even with great performance you can be stuck with a bad shift. Not much of a work life balance depending on your schedule and time zone. Personal discount is also good. Benefits, discounts Management, advancement Good place It was great until after COVID. There was no room growth anymore for remote workers. It you wanted to move up you were going to have to move to an in person location Non stop calls but okay job Non stop but calls but equipment is provided and pay is okay for starting out. I would recommend the job for someone who wants to work from home, just have to have wired internet. great co workers. made my best friends here! also there is a lot to learn with orientation. money was super solid, really amazing as far as retail is concerned. customers can be hit or miss. Apple It was a good work enviorment. Pretty chill people , a little fast pace but if you worked in retail thats always to be expected. I loved my tenure here. Innovation makes a great experience Working here truly are amazing because we tend to get to know more about the products and the customer who are in to our products. It is very interesting that we are able to help different masses Discounted packages, amazing benefits, good pay and healthcare Sometimes, there are irate customers Fun work place I’m apart of a great team, as long as you communicate with one another things will be great. Your schedule may not be ideal when your first start, but they are great at accepting requests for a specific schedule The Best Job Ever Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public. The store was always electric, although others may say crazy. I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating. The managers were all great and they were never above doing what they asked of their employees. The benefits and pay were amazing for a part time job. Working for a company with a brand such as Apple and experience to match that brand made me want to stay forever. This is a job I truly miss and I am thankful for the opportunity that I was given! Work environment Parking 43 17 Good ""Job"" but the customers will break you down. Its a good overall job with great benefits, but you get some really bad customers. With time these interactions will break you down and you start to hate customer service. You meet some great people working here, but also some people you'd rather not. Its a great environment for those who love apple On a typical day I work with customers solving problems with their phones. They also ask different questions when purchasing any device and making sure they make the right decision on. For the most part its chilled only on holidays and rerelease it can get hectic but overall great job. Productive and fun I enjoyed the position after awhile It took some time to get use to but after that it got easier as time went by! My training was kinda pushed along ongo the phone though. Great Job no Mobility Great job and good company to work for but Channel Sales feels like a dead end. Not many hours and honestly not a lot of room to grow. Apple Retail is a great transition Fun place to work It was a fun place to work and get to know people in the industry. I enjoyed my time working for Apple and will miss the company culture. It had a great work life balance. Fast Pacing with Interesting projects Plethora of interesting projects to work with. Even though this is a huge company, your work has direct impact on the user's expereience. Exciting place to be. Good benefits and fun workplace Good training and starting wage. Things can get extremely busy in Apple retail, but management is great for the most part, and having a big team is fun and collaborative Great culture and benefits Excellent place to grow, great culture and benefits. You get to know a lot of people. They give a lot of benefits, I felt very confortable working there and they always listen. Worst place to work They act like everything is gonna be okay that u have a support system but its all a lie no one is there to back u up! Everyone just wants to save their own jobs. the managers micro manage everything down to the minute you can’t even use the restroom Busy, but not bad The thorough training was wonderful, and the training advisors were very encouraging. There are many ongoing opportunities for learning about the latest products and services, so you will be knowledgeable as you provide customer service. Productive fun workspace meet great people with fun personalities and you learn something new everyday .... wish that compensation was a little more... management could be better Fun place to develop skills in any department You get what you put in & this place is amazing. The culture is everything you would want in a workplace! The managers really care about your development here and put in the effort to make you feel comfortable. Great place to learn and grow while supporting customers with the latest technology. The company has many opportunities for you to grow into. Lots of support around your development, both personally and professionally. Flexible working hours. best job coool job, its was a nice job with nice pay and good cowrkers , friendly enviroment and colll eaders eager to make you better and better and better everyday 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Very friendly and comfortable employee base. Everyone is genuinely in a great place and a great state of mind at work What is the most stressful part about working at the company? It’s Apple, there are no breaks. You are busy 24/7-365 What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Very positive, supportive, and kind. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Log in and check email, log into chat servers within 15 minutes, 3 breaks including “lunch/dinner” and then log out. No home work, nothing to worry about post shift Exciting company, high expectations, fast paced Apple definitely strives for excellence. I worked in sales as well as the genius bar. Sales is much less pressure than technical assistance. If you're on the technical assistance side, they have high expectations to multi-task and get through appointments quickly. Very fast-paced. Exciting company culture Toxic managers, very fast paced Great place to stay busy I worked from home for a while & although I'm usually exhausted when I get home from the store, I'd rather be there with all of the people & my friends than to work from home. Awesome Awesome thanks so very happy for your response I really enjoyed the book thank goodness I have not read the books but I’m glad to know you have some great ideas Productive Great company. I learned a lot about technology and such. I think the management could be a bit more understanding about things like sick days and bereavement, but overall a fine company. Unbeatable Benefits & Surprisingly Bad Management Let me start by saying I very much enjoyed working for Apple. I was on the Genius Bar Team pre-pandemic and then moved to phone support during the pandemic (which was debilitating and not at all the job I had the skills to do). The benefits are amazing, the work is fun, the people are great, the customers are eh, and the management is TERRIBLE. They are all just kind of like manager robots who are managing too many people to get to know anyone on an individual level and are encouraged to relate in the most creepy company way. It's an unsettling relationship and it makes everyone involved feel unsupported and like you are just a number. The Best Job Ever Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public. The store was always electric, although others may say crazy. I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating. The managers were all great and they were never above doing what they asked of their employees. The benefits and pay were amazing for a part time job. Working for a company with a brand such as Apple and experience to match that brand made me want to stay forever. This is a job I truly miss and I am thankful for the opportunity that I was given! Work environment Parking 43 17 Basic call center job It’s 70% customer service and the rest is troubleshooting iPhone/iPad issues. You have opportunities for advancement. Pros: employee discount, overtime sometimes. Cons: no training offered for other non customer facing positions Ok It's ok. Lots of busy work. You'll learn some things but you'll also not be able to do everything that you would want to do as an intern. It's what you make of it. Great workplace Apple was great to work for. Best part we’re the people you work with. Pay could have been better for a company worth trillions of dollars good job!!! Great products, not so much to work The best products with (formerly) the best support. Apple now mostly hires vendors who are underpaid and undertrained. You never know whom you will speak to when you call. Customers can be abusive and downright mean. Apple takes away any segment that is not customer-facing. Requirements are getting stiffer as well. Management is outside hires who have never taken a call and lack understanding of the role. Schedules change routinely so it's hard to plan your life. The pay is good but leaves a lot of room for improvement. The only advancement is available on campus. Benefits, Discounts, Cool stuff Vendors, poor training, lack of advancement Fun workplace and productive It’s a retail job so it is what you make it. The people there are out of this world.The relationships I’ve made there I hope will last forever because a workplace isn’t only the work. The environment matters too Productive and fun work place Good pay and work environment, retail sales but no commission. Very flexible house and friendly work environment, great career starter and internal growth oppt. Very productive environment. Its a very nice place to work some might even have to say that its a great place to work. Everyone there is kind and wants to get work done. People have fun and we serve good. Productive and Fun workplace Very inclusive position, easygoing yet challenging. Great staff and co-workers. Management is understanding. Workplace culture is inclusive and interactive and has amazing benefits! Benefits n/a Supportive and inclusive. This has been a wonderful company to work for. They encourage self development, and have tools to help you succeed. Quality people at every level. Opportunities for trying on different “career experiences”. Great benefits, clear job objectives, supportive environment. Dealing with ambiguity, demanding customers, focus on metrics. Things have changed, so has Apple. Not for the better. Ever since Steve Jobs left Apple work life balance is no longer balanced. The pay is no longer competitive with the skills that you obtain doing this job! There’s not enough room for professional growth and advancement. Great Was really a great company to work at, I had flexible time. It was a causal wear and alot of the time the customers were great. A lot of the customers knew what they wanted so it was easy Good people and great benefits Pro: - People are very supportive, and truly care about your growth and development - Great benefits - Very inclusive work environment - Lots of opportunity to expand in or past your role Con: - Salary is just okay - Advancement can be tied to a single manager/supervisor supportive environment that recognizes your efforts management is supportive and encouraging of employee growth and development in the workplace excellent healthcare benefits for part and full time workers great work-life balance for part and full time workers promoted after just 6 months of employment which shows they recognize hard work even in just a short amount of time fun, positive work culture work life balance, recognition from management, benefits, pay, raises, coworker culture focus on achievement by numbers, longer shifts for full timers Amazing diverse work culture Apple is an environment that continuously prompted learning, growth, and development. The values are human based and can easily be adapted to at work and at home. Culture and values At times you can feel unsupported but there is usually support available Amazing work-place culture The culture at Apple to help you succeed in whatever you're trying to accomplish with occupation is outstanding. Management cares, and focuses on how you can improve yourself, not just in your current role or with Apple in general. They want to help you to be the best you, that you can be. Great pay and benefits, multiple schedule options, amazing work-place culture Over the phone tech support, and working from home are not for everybody. Company values changed disconnect from management. Company was great in early-mid 2010’s. Policy changed to discourage repairs and only new phone sales. Buying phones outright to avoid upgrade charges from the carrier also banished. Our older clientele were left high and dry when learning sessions were discontinued. At every role you’re responsible for providing feedback to coach other employees, even laterally, this creates a huge disconnect with management since a majority of the responsibility falls now on to yourself and your peers. Due to this, management is rarely around and mostly in the back watching videos. This also creates a problem for advancement. Your told to “journal” about your achievement and growth, you can make up stories and situations that can push your towards a promotion. This leads to employees being in roles they are not properly trained for. Pay is very low compared to the profit made for the company. Even an entry level sales person can sell hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of product but will receive no commission. Instead, you’re told that you’re “doing your life’s best work”. Great job if you’re younger looking for a fast paced environment. Be prepared to apologize for everything. Queues are very long and the store doesn’t have any signage so you’re “the sign” as well. Reporting inappropriate workplace behavior or harassment takes months for an response if any. was decent however stressful was decent however stressful so many chats coming in with no rest multiple at one time as well your hands will be killing you daily so there may be a chance of coarpul tunnel Fun workplace, terrible management Do not bother working here if you have any self respect. This place will tear you down and make you regret ever applying. At the end of the day, it is a retail position with extremely heavy expectations of staff. Fun and challenging. Not the average retail experience. A lot happening, but fun and some of the best people to work with. Only con is retail scheduling and being more available during peak hours if you’re still part time. Positive workplace but workload can be overwhelming I have a good relationship with all my coworkers and I feel we had some amazing benefits. But besides the benefits, the workload was excessive and it was a highly competitive work environment. The Best Job Ever Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public. The store was always electric, although others may say crazy. I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating. The managers were all great and they were never above doing what they asked of their employees. The benefits and pay were amazing for a part time job. Working for a company with a brand such as Apple and experience to match that brand made me want to stay forever. This is a job I truly miss and I am thankful for the opportunity that I was given! Work environment Parking 43 17 Technically talented colleagues. Lots of bureaucracy There is a lot of technical experience to learn from. Unfortunately, there is a lot of bureaucracy that can be felt even at the IC level, which makes it more challenging to focus on technical growth. Relatedly, there is a strong risk averse culture. You may spend as much time pitching to leaders the need to try new things as you spend actually innovating. It’s not all its hyped up to be A lot of people put this company on a grand pedestal, as if it’s one of the best place to work and that’s not really the case, unless you working corporate. It’s starts off fine but after being there for a year or two you start to see the reality. The retail employees are basically the underdogs, and all of the glorified benefits that you get told about are mostly received by corporate individuals. The compensation and benefits are nice retail level too but the work life balance is absolutely horrible. The job itself is also very stressful, draining, and mentally demanding so I never have a social battery when I leave this place. You are bombarded by customers back to back and you really don’t get a break in between because they are concerned with their “numbers” so it’s very exhausting. The other side they don’t mention to you is the number of people who take their own lives or really struggle with mental health from being here so much. I have been here a while and seen people leave and go start new jobs and they seem much more happy. Don’t sacrifice your mental health for the extra dollar an hour. 1 Vacc status required for WFH positions Was great until they asked to know my vaccination status when I've worked from home for 8.5 and never lived near any location or even went to any office. Apple hates helping their employees. If you're someone who struggles with mental health do not work for Apple. They preach inclusivity and acceptance of others; but once you get in management will belittle you at the first sign of weakness and they'll do whatever they can to push you out rather than help you improve your standing in life Great benefits During my time at Apple, I've always raved about the benefits because they are amazing. At times it made me overlook the lack of job advancement opportunities for a majority of my time. Good place to work Enjoyed working with my team. Learned a lot while working there and had good communication with management. Good comp also. Wish the food was a bit better Fun Workplace I had a lot of fun working at Apple and I loved it so much that I want my kids to work there. I could always tell them how I felt and they understood and adjusted or fixed the problem. Lots of Friends! None at all Challenging but beneficial workplace Work was always just under full time limit for most folks. Creative job has undergone many changes and internal slogans change as often as Back of House policies. That said? Great health benefits, great stock options, and amazing coworkers at the local level. Fast pace work Pretty okay it wasn’t to bad just have to pay attention to details and be able to work fast pace while keeping customers calm helpful management helps also had a lot of fun i had so much fun working at apple, because of how fun and cool my coworkers were. the most fun i has was my “career experience”, which was awesome. wish it was more of a social club than an actual job lol Productive workplace Apple does a great job of making sure employees have interactive tasks to do at all times. Great coworkers and managers that facilitate in successful practices. Half & Half good benefits and perks, but culture can be gaslighting. depends what you are trying yo do, but i wouldn't necessarily recommend if you want real growth. Na fast paced work environment with opportunities to learn and develop. working hours were second shift and the customers were rude and entitled . overall the company did care for their employees Easy work and okay pay I enjoyed my employment with Apple the entire time that I worked there. Co workers were very friendly and management always made communication easy. Pay was okay for the position I held, would recommend as a job to get your feet in the door. Wonderful place Great work environment with wonderful coworkers and leaders. I felt supported every day that I went in. They truly cared about their employees. Would recommend. Overwhelming The overall environment and benefits from the company were in my best interest. But it became a lot to balance as a full time student. So beware of your time management & patience towards customers. No work life balance The work can be rewarding at times but it’s overshadowed by burn out. The benefits are great though. You also get to work with people that are equally as excited by technology. Great benefits Poor leadership Great benefits but no room for growth If you work remotely your career trajectory is limited. There is clear location bias and the higher up are fine with it. This undermines environmental and diversity initiatives. There can be a lot of bullying and leaders failing to provide consistency. Amazing company and great culture An amazing company to work for, with many top-notch benefits; diversity in backgrounds and ideologies; and usually excellent leadership (there are always bad apples out there), that care about you as a person, and help you develop in your career. Home-based remote options, varying shift options, and a dedication to work/life balance are excellent too. Personally have made many friends and enjoyed the camaraderie that develops. Great opportunity to learn about business and how companies run efficiently. Negatives include: Promotional opportunities can feel limited, and competition is quite tough. Some roles can wear you down over time, or lose their luster / become boring. Metric goals can sometimes feel opposite to customer satisfaction. Amazing work from home opportunity fair compensation Everything about the process is straightforward. training is done at home all equipment is provided. The call center actually has downtime during the day so its not crazy from the start of shift until the end."
Great American Insurance Company|" Overall a great place to intern This was my first internship in college and it was a great place to work! I learned a lot and was able to network with lots of different people in the company. The managers I had looked out for me and helped me find a job within the company. 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? The people What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Not enough full time positions What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Family feel with others willing to help each other Great people and freedom to do your job Fantastic place to grow and develop as an underwriter. The culture is supportive and they encourage you to have a life outside of work. I have not once been asked to stay more than 40 hours or received any pushback for taking the full PTO available. The company offers reimbursement and bonuses for continuing education as well. Best place I've ever worked. Not a Great company to work for Very exploitative, underpaid job with lots of pressure to handle a huge volumes of claims. Poor management and some of the higher-level staff are work-shy and more interested in chatting and laughing with their friends in the office or doing shopping online rather than giving you a hand when you’re swamped with work. The example they set for the employees is not great as you see them working very little while they work you to your bones. They happily delegate you tasks that they should be doing. The work in itself is not bad; it’s just that there's no meritocracy at all nor chance of career advancement, but lots of favouritism. This just makes you feel devalued and exploited. Also, some supervisors will easily humiliate you for making mistakes or not reaching the targets and say negative things about you behind your back. I wouldn't recommend this role to my worst enemy. pros: friendly colleagues, location cons: low pay, stressful job, poor management Too much work, not enough help. I didn't work that long. I only worked for maybe two weeks and there was too much work and not enough help. Too stressful. Did not have enough enjoyment there because I did not work long enough. People were not that friendly. Don't know. Did not work long enough. Left to find another job. Don't know. Did not work long enough. 4 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Work life balance What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Heavy workloads What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Collaborative What is a typical day like for you at the company? Highly micromanage Rotten Customer Service with a Smile You can get away with being nasty and rude to insureds or others that are covered. They do not follow up and you can give the run around to outside clients and/or insureds. Great Company No cons - good place and really value education. Lots of growth opportunities . Lots of classes and networking opportunity available. I would recommend especially if you are looking for longevity None None Team Focused I work as an intern and the team is focused on collaborations for user stories and it is truly a great place to work. When I feel imposter syndrome, I get validation that I am doing a great job and doing more than expected. productive and team oriented, good training for position This was a great place to work with excellent management and helpful, supportive co-workers. It was a very busy and challenging position with a large caseload. My days were filled with lots of different scenarios and working with the claimants was very interesting. If I did not have to relocate to another area because spouse's job, I would have stayed there. I am still in touch with some of my old co-workers who also have the same positive evaluation of this company. We worked in a very positive, uplifting work environment. The management was very professional and always communicated well at all levels. In fact, the CEO would meet with employees and set a positive tone throughout the work place. He believed in MBWA ( Management By Walking Around) which meant he would make a point to speak with each employee on a regular basis to see how they were doing and if they had any problems, questions or insights about the company. Overall, this was a very professional, caring, supportive and team oriented company. great collegues, supportive management, and overall professional work environment very busy, challenging with large caseloads Great Potential Great American Insurance Group has great potential but their poor leadership and upper management holds them back from growing. Management is out of touch with their employees. The company is meeting heavy. They should be investing more time training employees and continuing their education. Pay is fair. Time off is great. Medical insurance is an hsa with a high deductible. Really not ideal for someone that doesn't go to the doctor often. Overall they're an okay company but could use a change in some of their upper management. Compensation, work life balance Out of touch management, high deductible medical insurance Overall an okay place to work but can depend on department Good salary and smart people depending on the department. Very department specific as to whether your life sucks or not. Management can be old school and has a bit of a good old boy feel. Low pay Very low pay for the work. The work environment was OK. Some of the agents I worked with were a nightmare. The office manager at the local branch did a lot of fun things for the office. Fun office environment Worked with bad agents Did not learn anything new This is not a good place to work for a long time . You will have better opportunities in other insurance companies . Regret working there for a long time . They laid me off after 15 years . No loyalty Not a great place to work Very little training and no additional support. You won’t know if you are doing a good job or not because of not receiving information. Also you can be let go from a position without ever doing anything wrong. Benefits are terrible, they self insure so only one plan is available. Raises are cut to 2% because management wants to save money. None Healthcare, corporate Low paying They do not pay you a livable wage, when you want a raise, it will only be about 3% of your already little salary. The job is pretty easy but gets extremely repetitive. They will also ask you to do more work for less pay. Family like, good benefits including health insurance, lots of vacation days, 401-K. If you want a job where there is an opportunity for advancement, a family like environment and great benefits; then, this is the company you need to work for. Management is sometimes too nice and need to more firm when needed. Great company who treats employees well and support home/work/life balance. Great opportunity for advancement and excellent benefits. I've worked at GA 2 years and I couldn't be happier. Everyone is welcoming, friendly, and helpful. Your voice is heard if you have concerns. It's a team environment and everyone works well together. Benefits, work/life balance Claims Processor Productive and fun place to work. GAIG is a great and fun place to work. Has many opportunities and advancements. the work life balance is perfectly fine if you get what you are expect to get done. meet and exceed your goals, make managers happy and you will be too. Good work environment Overall, a good experience. Excellent training and management. Excellent products and support from home office. Good salary to start and all expenses paid when traveling. Management Travel Worst place I ever work I came this company during a pandemic. No training, whirl I was in CT alone everyone in Cincinnati amd no team work on island by myself also with a learning disability they did not help be successful after I brought my concerns they eliminated my position now been out since October with over 60 job rejections . Worst descion I made come work here and I suffering now fo it Overall a great place to intern This was my first internship in college and it was a great place to work! I learned a lot and was able to network with lots of different people in the company. The managers I had looked out for me and helped me find a job within the company. underpaid and overworked pay is definitely below similar jobs in area. difficult to complete all tasks as not much support. Underwriters wpuld benefit from having support staff. 3 Family Ownership Gives Small Company Feel Overall a great place to work. Like any public company there is a focus on the quarterly results. However, the founding family has significant control and allows them to be less sensitive and do the right thing for employees and business. Paid Time Off, Culture, Casual Dress, Extra Perks Benefits are just average Plenty of food High turnover due to inadequate inconsistent training and total confusion. Robotic verbage must be displayed. Stayed sick every time I walked in the building. A very dark working environment. Plenty of food and drink Confusing work environment without proper training It was a great environment until some leaders left & were replaced with people who just wanted to be in charge & would step on anyone. There is a reason that I left but I don’t like sharing negativity about anyone much less a company that I worked at for over 10 years. The company was great to work for until the last few years. Great company never should have left. ● Work-life balance Work-life balance at Great American Insurance Group is good. ● Pay & benefits My pay and benefits at Great American Insurance Group are competitive. Mundane Great job for getting established however not recommended for dreamers especially those who are creative. The work culture is nonexistent, very independent work. Get a manger that wants you to succeed Old technology being used. Bad attitudes in some groups. Just not a fun place to work anymore. Though no one has been laid off with Covid. After a decade I think I’m ready for a new challenge Great people with variety of oppurtunities I worked there for several years. Loved all my coworkers and had a great work/life balance. PTO time was generous and 401k Match was decent. Had good profit sharing if you were invested in the company stock Great company Family oriented with flexibility , management Is supportive and will get you any education that is needed to better and further your career, great company to work for Employee health is important to them Great American has a nice gym and encourages employees to be healthy. They continuously want you to be active with their behavioral assessments The company offers incentives for continuous learning.. Great Great American was a smaller office I enjoyed working there. It was a fun environment. I learned a lot of stuff there at that company. You will enjoy working there. Enjoyed my time there. They have a good balance of work\ life and decent benefits. Please read other reviews for a more comprehensive understanding of working here. Thank you. Micromanaged Difficult to get recognized and promoted within your area. Micromanaged feel. Not compensated or respected as a UAT role should be. Underappreciated. Productive & Customer Friendly Customer service is great Benefits are amazing The most enjoyable part of the job is learning and hearing about the different claim experiences the disadvantage of working here is no room for advancement Seems great at first... If you want to go somewhere and be very mediocre and just coast, this is the place. The raises are small, bonus is ok, career growth is horrible for most people, but you put up with it because of the stability...in general it sucks, period. Bad management Very negative and played favorites. New management took over and 18 employees left within a 3 year timespan. New Management has employees spy on each other or tattle. It was like being in high school. Excellent company with strong management I thoroughly enjoyed my 10 years working for this company. I had the opportunity to relocate at the company’s expense and there were opportunities to transfer to many other divisions within the company. Management strongly encourages the work life balance and rewards their employees in many ways. I always felt appreciated and was always encouraged by management. Good compensation but disorganized management Pros: The compensation packages are decent. They typically try to give you one training class a year. Company Christmas party (Slowly declining in quality) Cons: Very little remote work flexibility. No room for advancement. I.T. Management is very unorganized and are too busy playing internal politics to be proactive in fixing system problems. This causes a good deal of system problems which will affect your work life balance. There is a good deal of favoritism between managers and employees, which makes getting points across even harder as they will gang up to defend each other. They will not listen to qualified engineers, regardless of experience or certifications. Great benefits and work/life balance; favoritism in management Laid back atmosphere, great benefits and PTO, fair pay for the jobs that are being completed. Downsides in some departments are incompetent management. Sometimes, you advance based on who you know, not what you know. Great it was more of a learning experience than anything else. Your success depended on who you knew, with whom your were shadowing would determine your success. Too much favoritism and perception that equated to your pay due to it being an industry based solely on commissions. Overall a great place to intern This was my first internship in college and it was a great place to work! I learned a lot and was able to network with lots of different people in the company. The managers I had looked out for me and helped me find a job within the company. Productive and fun place GACi is a great place to work. There is a lot of diversity , opportunity to learn. The work environment is positive and uplifting. Contract jobs are long term 1 Great place to work Great American Insurance us a great company to work for. There are many divisions that are available for a potential candidate to apply for different types of positions. The people are extremely nice and helpful. 1 Crop insurance Gather all information for the claim and process it. Have computer knowledge and the program to process the claim. US Government backed and must follow all process correctly Very strong stable company The company is a very family, strong local Cincinnati company. There are significant employment opportunities with advancement potential. The company offers very good benefits including employee wellness programs, stock ownership and profit sharing. Not what is sold to you The work I did I was supported doing, but that was simply because it benefited someone else. You'll be told time and again that it's a ""family"", but unlike family, they will turn their back on you immediately, regardless of how well you are doing. Collaborative work Busy, most of the time manageable On-going education Management varies from division to Most often, good culture Sometimes dealing with people not at their best Completion of a file from beginning to end Gym Heavy Case Load Good place to work Good place to work. Has flex hours. Willing to train and work with you. A strong company. This company home office is in Ohio. They have two locations. Great Company Great Company that emphasizes employee happiness. Great work culture and environment. Co workers are easy to talk to and communicate with, managers are there for you in need of assistance. Data group management is very bad. They only worry about their advancement and not their employees. There is no advancement the management talks bad about you to the other managers. I was there for 6 years and so much stress I had 2 heart conditions and blood clotting. Doctor confirmed all this because of stress. Very comfortable work environment with friendly people My jobs at GAIG were my first taste of a professional work experience. Although daunting, the people made it a very comfortable work experience and were always helpful to answer questions. They also value their interns very highly and treat them as another employee. Good place to work Good place to work if you like claims. The expectations are not as stringent as other insurance organizations. a lot of autonomy when it comes to daily work. Great place to work! Open door policy, management is approachable for the most part. Very collaborative environment. Co-workers all have a great rapport and are always available for questions or to lend a hand if the workload is overwhelming. If someone learns something new or comes across a new tip/shortcut, they're sure to pass it along to the team. Flexibility to work from home if needed - once a week, team-building activities, other miscellaneous office perks make GAIG a very nice place to work. Breakfast and snacks provided, relaxed atmosphere Health insurance has a high deductible Love helping people I do lots of driving and meeting with people. Work on my own! Great American is a great company. They are very supportive of their employees. Their training is always 1st class and informative. Good Pay but no chance for advancement People were nice to your face but they hire from outside more than promoting from within so it is very hard to work here for a long period of time without eventually wanting to leave. Okay Working here was okay. There were long hours and lots of work to do, but then there would be random whole days where there was no work at all. Long days. Decent company I think they are really trying - they just aren’t world class employers yet. Raises are small. Bonuses almost nonexistent. Health plan is pretty bare bones - HSA option only . People are very nice but not much diversity yet. Nice people Very conservative wages. Almost no diversity - especially at management level I had the best mentor I had a mentor who was very supportive. Although I worked at this company for less than 1 year, I still could socialize with people outside my team!!! Worker's Comp division was fun There was a good group of people, and the work was straightforward. Support was available as needed, and management allowed reasonable autonomy. Culture is friendly. Clients are very small companies so they often don't have HR departments or experience with work comp. Very satisfied with mgmt amd culture. The culture is very positive. Work life balance is respected. Lots of opportunity for personal and career development. Strong ties to the community and arts. Good Experience balanced life It was fun working as team and management is very supportive and efficient. Work experience is excellent as lot of opportunities to learn more new thing and enhance your skill. Overall a great place to intern This was my first internship in college and it was a great place to work! I learned a lot and was able to network with lots of different people in the company. The managers I had looked out for me and helped me find a job within the company. Most depressing place I've worked. Poor work environment. People walk into work haggard and leave haggard. Very little positive interaction with others. Communicating with others frowned upon. Work model is head down and programming. Managers not making good decisions to foster positive work environment. Slowly removing perks. Location Poor management, chained to desk 3 Productive company Great American Insurance conveniently located by freeway 15, Balboa Avenue. Nice people. Pleasant quiet environment to work in. Not very many events for employees. 1 Talks a lot about a great place to work and be great but is just average at best. Just average at best place to work. They do just what they do for employees what is customary for comparable company. The medical health benefits are worst. High premiums and high deductibles. Pray you or family don't need medical attention often. Pay is comparable with other companies. Harrassment and discrimination and poor and expensive medical health insurance. Slow moving company Lot of laid back staff, slow moving. Technology is looked at as overhead which is completly wrong mindset in todays world. Senior management is out of touch on how to use data assests they have. overworked with outdated and no concrete training /constant change to procedures. high expectations and quantity is preferred over quality. great company overall. department offers little to no advancement. high expectations while being unorganized. can only apply for one position at a time Productive Learned a lot working here. Coworkers are easy and fun to work with. Work environment are safe and fun. A lot of company events which keep employee connect to each other. Good Company Great American Insurance Company was a good employer. We received benefits, advancement, average workloads, continuing education opportunities, and centrally located. Productive and engaging workplace with big corporate environment culture Developed a variety of communication materials: product literature, brochures, information guides, promotional pieces and print advertisements. Helped revamp two newsletters and served as managing editor of three company publications. I enjoyed working closely and directly with in-house creative graphic designers. Management seemed a bit top heavy and political to me, but workplace culture was good overall. The hardest part of the job was doing what I considered to be lesser quality promotional pieces that didn't require much talent or expertise. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with and working alongside other marketing professionals and creative colleagues. Negative Work Environment Managers played favorites. There was a lot of uneasiness when the head honcho was in the office - it's weird to work in such a tense environment. I did have a couple incredibly enjoyable coworkers, primarily the older folks who worked part time. Pay was not good but benefits were decent. Excellent company Very successful company that cares about its employees. Great benefits & bonus plan. Management works closely with subordinates to ensure that they succeed. Good training program & benefits. Treat employees great Extensive travel demands at times Productive and fun work enviroment Worked on your own but had plenty of support from management. Set up own appointments with insured so your work schedule flexible. Received training to fulfill job requirements. Set your own schedule No set work week, only worked when there was work Good Work Environment, Challenging Caseloads The caseloads at GAI were always high, 150-200. Out department worked on California claims only at that time. Since my employment there GAI sold their commercial line of business and they do not have a claims office here in SLC. They fostered a teamwork environment, good benefits Closure of the Salt Lake City office Work/Life balance oriented, slow moving job but relaxing IT moves very slow in this industry which has its perks but threatens to be mundane at times. People there are very much family oriented, nice and friendly but would sooner run home than get a beer with co-workers. Fun, fast paced work environment Fun work environment. The staff was great. The position I was in did not offer enough incentive for me to stay and not enough growth opportunity. It was basically the same work every day unless I wanted to be a field agent and go from house to house and get involved in production, which I had no interest in doing. Another down side would be if the producers did not want to invest in buying the time from a marketer. That would sometimes shorten hours for the schedule. The calls would seem discouraging as it was outbound sales. Over time getting yelled at by overwhelmed seniors before getting the chance to explain the benefits of your company meeting with them would be eventually became exhausting. Very good place to work Working with agents and insureds where meeting new people and learning new things. Working with other adjusters to complete claims timely and correctly, Great Boss I enjoyed my brief time at Great American Insurance. My boss just started to manage people and he's getting the hang of it quickly. Perks are great but it takes a long time to get decent parking. Benefits are great. Communication was not that great. good average, good to their employees. as long as their a contract for you to work on, you have a good job, otherwise you be let go, sometimes they try to get you with other projects. downtown downtown Great to be a part of the Linder family of companies. It was a good company to work for with great perks, such as a cafeteria with chefs. If you like insurance, there are many things to learn. Good experience. Great individuals to work with Great place to work with great people. I would recommend applying to this company. I have had a great time working there so far and enjoy it. However, in my own experience with the division that I worked in, very few or if ever promotions are handed out. Once you are in the position you are in, you stay there and receive a yearly raise. travel, christmas party, work environment, people yearly bonus, promotions great company its a great company to work for. everyday is different and with me its mostly the management that works better with people and helps encouarge everyone. Team work is the important culture here. The hardest part of the job is having people or team members that have been with the company for more than 10 years and hesitant to share information. Overall a great place to intern This was my first internship in college and it was a great place to work! I learned a lot and was able to network with lots of different people in the company. The managers I had looked out for me and helped me find a job within the company. Job at Great American okay job to pay the bills, wish i had quit before being laidoff seems they like to micro manage a experience employee which was a waste if nt time and expected a lot of travel work from home seems they continue to raise the bar for job exeptions 1 job at great american okay job, little to no advance opportunities in the past 14 years I worked them they keep pushing the bar and like to micro manage they only cared about the numbers, e none working from home I felt I was on a istand easf 1 A Typical day of work Typical day of work was to receive assignments to do appraisals on vehicles damaged and collisions submit work to supervisor payments were made in office appointments were made by you to set up your schedule Planned my day of work Planned my day of work Good pay, very tedious The job definitely pays well, and they start their interns at the same rate as full time workers. It gets very tedious very fast, and frequent breaks are necessary to keep up productivity. Poor management Management out of touch with employees. The employees that do their work end up getting more dumped and expected on them. No recognition for hard work or going the extra mile. Also GA states that they encourage advancement but applied for other jobs in the company and didn't receive any, politics are everywhere. Ample PTO days, 401k, good co-workers Downtown parking, compensation The company allowed me to develop strong relationships with agencies and helped me hone my recruiting and training skills. Most of my time was spent in the ""field"" - recruiting, training, and developing production from independent annuity and life insurance agencies. The company went through multiple reorganizations during the years I was employed. The hardest part of my job was identifying agencies that focused on Great American's core markets - 403(b) and 457(b). The most enjoyable part of the job was achieving success in geographical areas that historically produced very little business for the company. Focused market, competitive products and commissions Frequent reorganizations. Challenging projects utilizing diverse strategies Appropriately challenging environment with an entrepreneurial spirit. I was involved with setting strategies, company acquisitions, development of staff, and the introduction of new technologies. I felt everyday was an adventure. I went from supporting daily operations for all GAI Corporate Systems along with various financial systems for the parent company - American Financial Group to being invited to various c-level meetings. For example, there were times when I was told to be at Lunken Airport and be prepared for a two day acquisition trip. I enjoyed the challenges of understanding the corporate strategies and socializing the strategy with my teams. In my current role at Ohio National Financial Services, I put together various application roadmaps and strategies to support distribution and compensation systems for Agents. My team was very instrumental in delivering the Oracle Cloud ERP environment. I have also worked on the Architecture Review committee defining ONFS enterprise Architecture. While I find this very rewarding work, it has been extremely frustrating trying to get leadership to support these efforts. I want to be in a position where I can add value based on my strong technical and business abilities. I want to be in a more innovative position. Great company to learn the insurance business I've learned about the insurance industry working at Great American Insurance Group. I've also been able to achieve professional designations. The company values work/life balance. Great Place to Work! Great American is truly a great place to work and grow your career. They have an awesome work/life balance and care about their culture. They have a very casual environment and a high focus on security for their customers and employees. Relaxed Culture No longer in personal lines in NY This company was great while it was around. They are no longer writing any personal lines business in the state of NY. I am uncertain if they are writing any personal lines any longer Downtown environment is awesome, can be enjoyable company Overall, a good place to work. However, current dept is more focused on delivering multiple projects versus quality. And people can easily get burnt out with high expectations and spread too thin. Current dept had no formal training. Downtown, remote work ability, good pay focus on volume vs quality, little to no formal training Productive and Forthright The hardest part of the job is adapting to the daily changes and procedures as we are always trying new ways to ""make it simple"" for customers. This job is forthright in the fact that we come into the office go straight to our desk and start processing. The most enjoyable part of the job is the team builder outings we have every quarter. Free coffee, Work from home option Short breaks Ultra conservative To Management - The harder you work, the more work you give me. I'm check to check and we do not see being able to afford a small house in our lifetime working here. They do not reward talent and they just don't recognize it. I am way under utilized. It's a job Overly cheap with employees, 1980s furniture and culture, ZERO work flex time, need PTO for a doctors appt, overly micro managed and if you havent worked there long or not inside a circle, your are just out and they talk about you. Very tit-for-tat culture. I enjoyed the department I worked in My immediate boss and VP were both very easy to work for and the environment was always good. I enjoyed coming into work every day and they offered a fabulous work/life balance for me. Pay ins't high enough great Staff. Adminstative Assistants always included Setting up claims, attaching incoming Correspondence. monitoring billing from Law Firms. Managers depended on your support and showed appreciation. Everyone received perks & additional benefits Wonderful people, good work, great learning experinces In the 5 years that i interned here at Great American, I have been given the oppertunity to branch out to other departments and learn new lines of business. In that time, I have met and worked with some very amazing people. The work that they had me doing, even as an intern, had a major influence in day to day functionaility of work. I've learned so much in the time that I've been with the company. Business practices, Insurance, and programming languages, as well as database structure. Good company I feel Great American Insurance was a great company to work for. Working the non-profit sector was a tough but enjoyable position. The only reason I left was for a better financial opportunity. Overall, good company The company is high profile, offers great perks and opportunities for advancement. I had great managers thru the years and loved the challenge. Overall, a good company to work for. Work environment Health insurance The most enjoyable part of my job I enjoy my co-workers and the challenges of learn new things. I also enjoy the fact my co-workers feel confident in coming to me for help with issues. Gym classes in the building and membership at low cost Paying for parking I enjoyed working at GAIG a great deal. The ECA division was a great place to be. There were a lot of changes, but I felt the managers were great at helping with new expectations. They were also understanding about family things. Great managers No overtime pay"
Reynolds and Reynolds|" 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? The management really cares about the employees. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Nothing, really except some positions are hard to get promoted from. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Progressive 4 Thank you for your review of your time working for Reynolds. We're pleased to hear you enjoyed your time with the company, we take pride in caring for our employees! Don't work here. Just, don’t. I didn't listen to the other reviews. The benefits are horrible, you are going to be paid 10-20,000 less than you should be and you will not be able to advanced quick enough for it to be worth it. Eh... Not that great Their application process alone is absolute garbage... 2 HOUR APPLICATION!!! Seriously?? It hasn't even been updated in 4 years. Current employees have to go through the same process and they don't even pay that great. Most of their jobs are under 40k a year. It's a job Application process!!, Pay, and no remote 14 I do not suggest working here I have worked here in PT and FT capacitity as an ends to a means. It is a stable company but it will underpay and overwork you. They sell themselves as an entry level company because no matter how long you work their you will be paid entry level salary. They are extremely anti-inclusive and managers are generally not supportive. If you are looking to start your career and leave in a year or two, I suggest it but other than that I would not suggest. Good entrance level job Heavy workload if you let them; many different types of management, though. Wonderful coworkers, but not much room to move up. Not great compensation. Caps at a 5% raise. Great place to start your IT career The datacenter will hire you without any professional IT experience (provided you can make it through the incredibly annoying interview process), which makes it a great place to beef up your resume if that's your desired career path. You will touch on many different aspects of IT, from hardware configuration/installation/maintenance, to network configuration and troubleshooting and everything in between, with plenty of downtime to pursue IT certifications at your leisure. Joining the datacenter team means you start on 3rd shift and gradually make your way up to 1st shift. Unfortunately, there is no guaranteed timing or criteria -- it all depends on what the business needs at that point in time. Luckily, I was only on 3rd shift for about two months, but some of my coworkers were on 3rds for over a year before an opportunity opened up for 2nd shift. The pay is... okay. Surely not anywhere close to industry-leading, but again, this job requires no professional experience. You'll get regular increases every 6 months or so, but nothing crazy. My biggest complaint is that if you get promoted, say 1 month after your review, they will not adjust your salary until your next review. I was ""promoted"" yet continued to receive the same pay as my old position for 5 months, and the same is true for another of my coworkers who left around the same time as me. With that being said, that's really the only thing that left a bad taste in my mouth with this company. I enjoyed the work. My co-workers were great. Management was great. The campus itself was really cool and has some great perks that Great personal atmosphere, but cliques kill At the beginning, was a great experience, and felt like I was learning. When the honeymoon phase was over, it quickly transitioned into an abusive relationship. Felt like I couldn't reach out for guidance and nothing was good enough. Its alright Do what you have to do and you get what you earn. Management was okay, never really supported anyone. Cafeteria and food was really good, nice gym and restrooms! Chill place No work/life, immense pressure The job is draining, you get in at 7 and don’t leave until 8 and sometimes you have to work Saturdays because the team is understaffed and overworked. Management pressure you to stay and finish titles but don’t provide a quick and effective solution to the problem. They also become upset with the team because we couldn’t make miracles happen to clear out the day under their schedule, but again did little to solve the issue. They would rather lose people with experience and knowledge in the process and hire new workers instead of giving them a raise when asked to. Coworkers were amazing though! Supervisor is also great, does the best she can with what she is allowed and has. Great first job, mileage may vary Generally I think your enjoyment of the job will depend on your department. Every department is different - upstairs jobs seemed much stricter, less flexible, etc. I worked downstairs, had a great manager, very flexible hours. The 401k matching is insane for a college student with no experience kind of job. Not a bad place for learning computer skills I was a computer tech, so I built and repaired computers every shift. I averaged from 3-4 every shift which was around 4-8 hours depending on how I scheduled my time since I was part time. You start part time and then have to “prove” yourself through a test for full time positions. If anything, the cafeteria and the gym are pretty good! Work at home. I worked there for 5 months and was recently let go for no reason. I don’t recommend working there at all. Seem to be very nice and say they wouldn’t fire you but they will Easy duties to carry out I worked out on the field collecting, counting and weighing the recyclables. It wasn’t a job that was hard to execute. Also with teamwork the job was alway quickly finished. Easy job. Great customers that often treated the team. Even tip amongst team Far job sites are inconvenient for bus commuters Good experience This company provides great experience coming straight from college or switching careers. There have also been multiple chances to move up within the company as well. 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? The medical benefits What is the most stressful part about working at the company? The low pay and monotonous work. The constant micromanaging. The promotion of unskilled employees into middle management. I would advise people to live as soon as possible Anyone can work here, not everyone stays here Easy to get in. Internships lack certified trainers. Everyone feels entitled to pass the buck to the next peer, lack of moral, toxic work culture and environment in all aspects. Flexible schedule Culture and upper management Keep Looking First, have you seen the movie office space? I would highly recommend watching it before you accept a job here. If that seems like a place you would want to work then go ahead and accept. If not, I would look elsewhere. Additionally, don’t fall for the product advisor title. You are just a customer service representative that gets yelled at by customers because the software never seems to work right & the majority of the time you can’t help the customer anyway. Pros: Co workers/managers were not bad Cons: About everything else. Feel embarrassed to even have worked for these guys. Awful pay Pay sucks for the amount of work you have to do. I was a printer tech and it was very demanding for the small amount of pay you are compensated for….. Lunch room is good and the gym is decent You can only work less than 27 hours a weed if part time. Productive Good place to work and good pay management will listen to you and everyone gets a long with each other most of the time. Bonuses and benefits are good Great company to gather skills for your career! Good culture and learning environment. I learned a lot there and met some great people. Benefits are tough to beat. However, pay is low so it's tough to stay, even with promotions. Great Co-workers While I did not enjoy the work I was doing, all the employees at the company were incredible. They were completely understanding about my situation and worked with me to make accommodations. If I were in a different role and had other duties, I could see myself staying there until I retire. 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? The management really cares about the employees. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Nothing, really except some positions are hard to get promoted from. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Progressive 4 Thank you for your review of your time working for Reynolds. We're pleased to hear you enjoyed your time with the company, we take pride in caring for our employees! Great place to start. This is a great place to start your career if your just trying to figure out your life. Non-competitive pay makes it hard to stay here, but aside from that. It was nice. Relaxing work Pay 4 1 good pay for work was reasonable as a part time job. became close with colleagues throughout my time. regular performance reviews with raise after. overall, enjoyed the job while I was doing school. 2 2 Very drained and sad place. Reynolds and Reynolds is a sad place with low pay bad managers and decent hours. It's a good place to start off but not a good long-term job. Just overall not good. dining hall, Lots of people bad managers, bad work economy, bad pay Weird place to work Maybe I just got unlucky, but my supervisor seemed more concerned with getting me to quit during the probationary period than with finding a way to help me be successful. Their testing process is very thorough, but once you test in to certain departments, you're there for life. And, in those departments, the jobs just get harder and with worse schedules. Great Work Environmen not so great pay Love the people but I was paid under what that position usually pays by about 5-10K a year. Make sure to ask for higher salary, they have the money for it. The benefits are pretty good except the health insurance has such a high deductible and that's the only one they have. You won't reach the deductible before the year restarted unless you have a whole lot of medical expenses. Waste of time They make you take ridiculous tests that have nothing to do with the job before getting hired. Very difficult even for a university graduate, and they took roughly 3 hours to complete. Don’t waste your time with this company. Very weird practices. Easy paycheck but easier to become bored and complacent Great place to work at truly, however when the work starts to slow down for the season (usually winter holidays), it's definitely a challenge to get through your shift. Growth is slow, but the raises were unexpectedly consistent which was cool. Great entry-level job, easy paycheck, bangin' breakfast burritos management could provide more routine feedback No company culture at all Good company for a right out of college candidate, but the pay was not competitive and there was no sense of company culture at all. Fellow employees left quite frequently. Free parking Horrible CEO, outdated salary, non-existent company culture Worst place to work in America Unless you are in sales and clearing $200k+, this is a joke of a culture and company. The owner is facing the largest tax evasion DOJ case. If you are a new college student; there are better places to get experience. If you are paid less than $45k working here, get out and find a higher paying job. If you are still at R&R after years and years, that’s on you. Not much Everything is bad here Decent but Underpaid My time at STA - Reynolds and Reynolds in Duluth, GA wasn’t the worst ever. The pay was rubbish, but the people were alright. The work was monotonous, but we all listened to music or TV while we worked. Monday through Fridays, no weekends. Headphones, Easy Work Underpaid Support Great place Good people Nice environment room for growth Would recommended Lovely staff Kind hearted Work life balance is important This is a good place Repair Technician Reynolds & Reynolds has a really bizarre culture. I met some friendly people there and eventually enjoyed my time. When I first started everything felt a bit off and management was really bad. They didn’t want to train me and had a, “I’m smarter than you that’s why I’m the manager” attitude, which I find odd. The interview process was weird, they drug test for nicotine, coworkers typically have been there more than 5+ years and haven’t moved up in their careers at all. There’s some nice welcoming people. Majority weird coworkers that either don’t talk to you or talk too much. Unfulfilling The job itself (my position, at least) is boring and unfulfilling. It is 2021, there is no reason to not have a work from home option, especially during inclement weather or sickness. This is not a company that is ""hip"" with the times. The people are nice Required unpaid hour lunch, no WFH option, unfulfilling Good starting entry level job Good entry level work environment. Part time work is easy to learn and the hours are flexible. It is also a good place for full time employees that was to move to professional atmosphere. Low pay, inflexible, little opportunity for advancement Not a bad place to start out, but not good for long term career. Low pay, only slight increases and not every year. Few opportunities for advancement. Management is an old-school boys club. We worked from home during most of the pandemic but were forced to come back to the office this summer. No negotiation, no hybrid options. Good for entry level experience and that's it This would be an okay place to start right out of college. However, just know this is a company with very old school corporate ideals. There isn't really any way to move up in the company unless you've been there for over 10 years and even then you have to wait for someone to retire. The company does not value individualism. You are there to get a job done and that's it. The team I worked for unfortunely made it feel like high school bullies. My manager had favorites and would talk about other employees. Certain people were allowed to consistanly be gone while still on the clock for hours while if you weren't a ""favorite"" you would get talked to about going and talking to a co-worker for more than 5 mins, even about work related issues. It's a shame this company hasn't caught up to the times more with all the young people they have working there. Just keep your head down, do your job, get the experience and go make more money elsewhere. Good matching 401k Micromanaging, stuck in the past Micro management Too much micro managing and promoting their friends and family but then they tell you they don’t have the money for anybody else to receive a pay increase. Would never recommend this job to my worst enemy. Good benefits Management, pay Toxic enviroment and cliques Management has their own cliques and set in their own ways. They create a toxic work environment moat of the time because they only care about themselves. Breakfast Everything else Great Culture, Training and People I have been at Reynolds for over ten years, their focus on employee training and development is top notch. There are opportunities to move up and advance your career. Gym, Cafeteria, Great People and Advancement Pay isn't as high as some places Good starting position, but be ready to work! We process work for customers. They set the amount of work that needs to be done and expect it to be completed the same day. Where some time we are getting done on time. More often it is long hours. The good news is most of us get overtime, but it can be a scheduling nightmare. Cafe, gym, and Medical on site. Long hours, not great pay 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? The management really cares about the employees. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Nothing, really except some positions are hard to get promoted from. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Progressive 4 Thank you for your review of your time working for Reynolds. We're pleased to hear you enjoyed your time with the company, we take pride in caring for our employees! Supportive management I worked there so long ago, I can’t really speak to how they operate now. However, I did have a wonderful and supportive manager that diligently worked to improve my skills and my advancement within the company. 2 5 Excellent management This was a good place to work. Pay wasn't the best but everything else I was satisfied with. Management really felt like they cared about the employees. Schedule, management, laid back Pay 2 2 A average place to work. There's pros and cons. If you come to work on time and do your job there should be no problems. Great scheduling for part-time workers and average for full-time workers. Management is a normal compared to other companies. They are out of touch with the daily work by most associates but not that bad. On site cafeteria and gym. Beginning pay is average for most jobs but low pay increases over the years. Terrible management, Clueless Unrealistic work. Always chasing the reactive side. Never proactive. Too many issues with the products. Make up for bad planning with more work. Terrible policies and product testing. Peers Pay! Management! National respected company Lot of great people to work with. Travel can be a bit much at times but you grin and bear it. Hoops one has to jump through to make paycheck other then the minimum are a little bit much. Excellent people Upper management is to controlling Don’t Do It One of the worst places you could ever work. 0 ethics, if you are a high performer they don’t care, and the moment you question how things are done you will be told that’s just the way it’s always been done. Extremely glad I got out Coworkers became good friends Healthcare sucks, management, office atmosphere, company culture Remote is the way to go I worked for this company remotely. My supervisors were always extremely easy to talk to and allowed you to be flexible with your schedule. I worked Remotely for over 4 years and can not speak to what it is like in the office. The job was super easy but quickly becomes mundane. Great place to work Reynolds and Reynolds has great benefits and a fun culture. Solid company with opportunities for growth. Day to day stress can vary depending on the group you work in. Very corporate for good reasons and bad Some departments have it easier than others, I was with POWER Support and we were the favorite department. Hours are extremely consistent, weekends and holidays are guaranteed off. Really, one of the greatest places I've worked in the sense of a life/work balance. The only complaint is that you get treated like a number. If your ticket queue gets too high the management starts circling overhead like vultures. Fantastic state of the art facility, awesome coworker cohesion promotion events, great benefits Very corporate environment, drink the kool aid if you want to survive Decent entry level job, can be stressful Current employee looking to branch out into other fields. The company overall is pretty dated in their practices and ideals. Strict dress code, tied to a cubicle, constant location monitoring. You'll probably get talked to if you take too long of a bathroom break. Things like that. Pay isn't bad for an entry-level position. Can't complain about the people there either. Everyone I've met is extremely nice. They're big on camaraderie within the culture. You're encouraged to sit with coworkers at lunch and get to know each other. TL;DR - Decent cubicle job with some dated management practices. Gets stressful at times. Nice people, decent pay/benefits, good 401k match, somewhat flexible hours Dated management practices, constant monitoring, stressful workload at times Your coworkers will be great BUT... Your coworkers will be great and you can make good friends BUT management is absolutely the worst. Communication issues are abundant throughout each department and between departments. Great workplace for part time but terrible for full time. Flexible hours Bad Management Enjoyed the job Good management, my manager was easy to work with. Great entry level position for IT. They provided the needed training for the equipment you worked on and supported you if you had a question or was unsure about a piece of equipment. Good job, vehicle and tools provided. Great technical support for remotes. Pay was a little low but you have time/flexability for a second job. Insurance could be better Old-fashioned, flexible, helpful company I saw myself fitting in here since the first interview. They're a large and old company, but not intimidating. Had my own office and was pretty much left to my work most of the time (but help was always an email or short walk down the hall away). I would recommend reaching out for help whenever you need it, because they definitely won't just hand you all the answers. That's how I got let go, I didn't want to bother anyone above me and thus fell behind, but there are plenty of helpful people there. Would work there again in a heartbeat. Good resume builder I found this to be a great company to begin my professional career. With the amount of stress I would not recommend building a major career out of it. They Try They try to keep up with trends, but tend to fall behind and then attempt to catch up before fully understanding what they are rolling out to the company. Good relationships with supervisors Poor communication from management, heavy workload Amazing I loved every minute of working at Reynolds and Reynolds! I left due to the traveling position I had and personal reasons! I would love to work for them again! sucks I was hired on as a temporary employee through a staffing company. Reynolds did not communicate with agency at all so all so 40+ temporary employees were laid off exactly a week before christmas with no news on another job or anything lined up. easy job laid off a week before christmas with no news of new employment Poor If you want underpaid for the work they require apply...also management definitely has there favorites and aren't afraid to show it....also if you like to be lied to every day great place for that It's a paycheck. Good news is that if you can pass the awful pre-hire testing, it's stable and a paycheck. They're not looking for innovation or better ways to do business. For that matter, they're not investing in you, either. Management is a joke at best and questionable business ethics trickle from top-down (see Brockman's $2T IRS tax evasion case. The new COO timing matches well when the rumors about the case started flying.) Hopefully you get a good supervisor, but people also quit bad bosses. Be quiet, go to Bible study, and don't make waves. That's my success tips. 401k match is awesome, good healthcare, onsite cafeteria and clinic Professional development is non existent and there is a lack of integrity in management Catty women and fired without warning Fully grown old women acting like high school girls makes for a toxic work environment. The job was boring and honestly there wasn't enough to do through the day. During COVID-19 we have been working from home, and I was fired via a 1 minute phone call for seemingly little to no reason. My manager actually hung up on me. 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? The management really cares about the employees. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Nothing, really except some positions are hard to get promoted from. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Progressive 4 Thank you for your review of your time working for Reynolds. We're pleased to hear you enjoyed your time with the company, we take pride in caring for our employees! A Great Company This large company offers a something for a lot of backgrounds. In my specific role, I am able to make an impact to many departments. Management is extremely flexible and constantly assists with opportunities for personal and professional growth. Robust training, flexible Below industry average compensation 2 Thanks for the review! We certainly hire for a wide variety of skill sets and employees have a chance to make their mark across the organization. If associates have concerns about their salary, we recommend a conversation with their supervisor. Great starter job depending on what department you establish yourself in I truly believe my work experience at Reynolds & Reynolds was unique to the exact team I was on or sub-department within the company. The management did not work well together. I had a head supervisor (who made our sub-department) and two supervisors below her. My team was female dominant as the tasks we were accomplishing fit better within a female personality. The manager of our team didn't even know what we actually did nor took the time to really understand it. So when issues arose, proper conclusions and solutions were never made. Eventually the head supervisor went back to sales and the two sub-supervisors continued to lead the team. Favoritism was a huge issue, but on top of that - forming close relations with your team members cause so much strife. Interpersonal relationships caused drama and biased opinions. That in one moment I was following the rules, they made exceptions for what someone else wanted. We had people who definitely disliked others on the team who performed quality control checks on every sales document we made. Our performance evaluations were dictated on how many mistakes we made. The other QCer was nice to everyone and graded fairly. I would be QCed by the nice girl and get back maybe 2-4 mistakes I needed to correct. The other one, I apparently would have 8-12. This gave me so much anxiety. This stemmed mainly from drama and the rules our making sales documents literally changing every single week. I can roll with the punches and I knew I was doing a good job, but for my job progression being ruined by someone who didn't like me.... that was not Gym, Sports, Cafe, C-Store, Awesome people, make friends, flexible hours Management 11 Great company to work for! This is a great Mon-Fri corporate style job. Great people and very experienced knowledgeable professionals! Best team in the automotive/tech industry. Paid the bills, destroyed my mental health Extremely strict about time: you must not take more than 60 minutes for lunch, you MUST be in the building from 8am-5pm, and if you're a few minutes off, you'll be reprimanded. There was never enough work to fill a whole day, but socializing with coworkers was highly discouraged. They also have a ridiculously strict dress code. Stable Stable company with ok benefits. Great 401k. Low pay. Lots of great people work here but there is also a significant amount of mid to low performers. Overall not bad though Don't bother unless you need experience. Good starting point for entry level as they like to pay far below industry standard. Just do well on their little test, people complain about it but it's not too bad. If you're here more than 2 years you're a sucker. Management doesn't do much except scan one another's badges to pretend they're in the building (yes they track you). The hidden camera's in the womens restroom however are not the companies doing, which I suppose is a bonus. Don't worry they'll sweep stuff like that under the rug because not all publicity is good. Fairly lax and clean environment. My manager and team were all fairly understanding and enjoyable to be around. The work truthfully was unrewarding, but good if you are looking for something sustainable. i enjoyed my job but the upper manger was no good I like making the money and enjoyed my work and the people i work for . But the manger could be more helpful. And the way they talk to you was crazy . have to work weekends and not flexible with student schedule have to choose weekends to work with, not really able to pick your schedule. Job is good when they arent busy for a schedule. Boss was kind of mean and training was not sufficient for performing the job, always have to ask questions after Terrible management If you want to work at a company with terrible management and no respect for you as a worker, this is the place for you. The managers ONLY care about telling you what you did wrong and never recognize when you do things right. At least your coworkers are pretty cool. Great Culture Community Outreach, Employee engagement, networking, training were all very positive attributes of working for this company. Micromanagement and work/home life balance were to be desired. Company is slowly dying and they don’t care about you Was let go because sales volumes have decreased drastically - be wary of length of time this company could be around. The department had myself and 1 other person and it was too many to deal with commissions processing. Manager was great, people around my department were great, but the company doesn’t actually care about its employees. It’s worrisome. I’ve seen how much money the company has (friend used to work in accounting and had access) it’s embarrassing what they make and what we were paid. Entry level pay for management level demands Reynolds appears to prioritize pizza parties and other frippery over paying employees well, management is catty and not supportive, and the work load is often not able to be spread to an appropriate number of people because executives will not authorize new hires. Free wine/beer at events poor healthcare, bad management, poor pay Large company with fair pay and benefits Challenging to get past the initial test in order to get an interview (approximately less than 20% acceptance rate). Really good 401K match at 100% of 6% contributions. Safe and comfortable environment / Large property Wide variety of extra curricular activities and family friendly Lots of perks Management is really friendly and helpful. Reynolds is very big on creating an inclusive work environment. Onsite gym, convenient store, doctors office (akin to a grocery store clinic), barber shop. Plenty of after hours clubs and events. The work isn't the most exciting thing in the world but it is definitely a company with decent benefits, great employees, and a fun culture. Very Conservative Workplace The sales internship was a fantasic experience, but Reynolds still has some improvements to be made. Their other internships were less attractive than the sales internship and their benefits for full time employees are lacking a little. They have no maternity leave and no formal HR dept. Okay place to work at The People are nice and friendly. The work week is slightly longer, and benefits package is average or slightly less than average compared with many companies. Good Good work environment with great people to work with The office people are very helpful when it comes to filling out paperwork and other benefits as well as they are understanding Great springboard company This company has little by way of career advancement. But it is great for getting some working experience to springboard somewhere else. They also have some great benefits like a gym and a full-week cafeteria. The job is ok this job is great to get started in any tech related field. Take advantage and learn as much as you can. That I can say they are really good at. Advancing is harder 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? The management really cares about the employees. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Nothing, really except some positions are hard to get promoted from. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Progressive 4 Thank you for your review of your time working for Reynolds. We're pleased to hear you enjoyed your time with the company, we take pride in caring for our employees! Pleasant The interview process you have to go through is challenging, but not impossible. They expect highly competent employees there and they reward commitment. Job Security Thank you for being a Reynolds employee and leaving us a review! The Reynolds assessments are just one of the tools that helps us identify the best candidates for our company. They ensure that we’re finding the right job for you based on your skills, personality, and long-term career goals. Ok job, wouldn't go back Don't expect to praised for going above and beyond. Don't trust anybody there. Insurance isn't great, 401k is awesome, vision and dental insurance is awesome. Overall work atmosphere isn't great. It's easy work but not great pay. 3 Reynolds has many ways to recognize and celebrate associate achievements. Whether it’s our Meritorious Performance Awards (MPAs), our HooReys! (special shout-outs), departmental awards, or annual company awards, we’re always striving to acknowledge the efforts of our employees. If an associate ever feels underappreciated, unnoticed, or unfairly compensated, we encourage them to have a conversation with their supervisor. Career Experience Excellent experience, just time to move on. Lots of great employees who work very hard. Some middle management issues where employees were not given the respect they deserved. Negativity disguised as positivity TLDR, not a great place to work. The company has some very good aspects (training incentives and classes they offer for free, on-site gym and cafeteria, decent compensation) that are quickly drowned out by a cut-throat, back-stabbing, focus-on-mistakes culture that will suck the life out of your sails. I worked with fantastic people in Sales Administration who believed in sharing the workload, offering to work overtime and come in early in order to complete the MANY tasks assigned to our department; I worked for below-average people - a management team who was quick to discipline and VERY HESITANT to notice initiative and reward hard work. They were even slow to recognize hard work, much less compensate their employees for it. The culture became toxic and untrustworthy - they eventually had us treating our Sales Representatives (members of the company who sold out in the field) as HOSTILE CUSTOMERS. The expectation for how we were to behave was miles off what situations called for. Overtime was expected (cough, required) while management left at 4-4:30pm everyday, citing ""personal business"". Most management members would pass down urgent work assignments right at the end of the day and then leave for the day. Do yourself a favor - if you're looking for a year of work experience in an office, or a career, look elsewhere. Or, work in a different department. But beware of Sales Administration. Dining services, gym, coworkers Management, work-life balance, negative culture Reasonable place to work Reynolds & Reynolds is a reasonable place to work. The difficulty of the work I would rate rather low. However, that comes coupled with low upward mobility and stagnant wages. The culture in the company is largely based on which department you are hired into, some are strict and harsh, others are great and welcoming with understanding and helpful management. Onsite cafeteria and gym, many company sponsored events Low upward mobility and stagnant wages Serving your time Advancement in the company was more or less based off of your years served rather than talent. I saw several very talented press operators passed over for advancement because someone with less talent but more years served applied for the job. My manager was very reasonable and understanding to work situations and helping everyone do their job the best they could. Good/bad It’s a good job but they will literally just get rid of you for no reason without any notice at all which is really sad. The work environment is awesome though Caution! Beware! There are no long-term satisfying careers at Reynolds Caution! Beware! There are no long-term satisfying careers at Reynolds until the CEO dies or sells the company. He’s approaching 80 years old and makes every single decision of any importance at the company. The culture he has created is negative for customers and suppliers, toxic for employees, and he has a handful of yes-man he has surrounded himself with that dutifully execute his commands Conservative, out of touch This is a very old company with very old ideas about how work is done. They track your whereabouts and have no leway when it comes to working preferences. You really feel like a cog in a machine there instead of a human being. Nothing to say The company is fair to its employees and is privately owned. They offer healthcare benefits and paid vacation to their employees. The company does a consistent job of promoting from within. Diverse, loyal and driven Loved every aspect of my career. From my colleagues to the management and staff I trained weekly. Teaching is more full filling when it apply s to you in a way that is personal. Great place to work where no two days are the same Everyday is something different, which makes it so work is never mundane. A great management staff really makes all the difference with this job and makes it so I don't want to leave. Reynolds and Reynolds has changed so much since I left that I don't feel qualified to comment on the company in 2019. I worked there in the 90s. Dealership automation still relied on a Mainframe computer in a special room. Since then dealership automation is as simple as networking the laptops on every employee's desk. It's a different world baby. Better ask somebody who works there now or left within the past few years Selling to automobile dealers can be a challenge, be sure your sales skills are top-notch, you'll be fine if they are. Car dealers are tough, You're better off dealing with Kim in North Korea then trying to make money selling to a car dealer. Productive and fun workspace The majority of the people I was around were college students who were fun to work with while being productive. Every day was sort of the same throughout my time working there Great people, below average management My position at Reynolds was mentally strenuous. My co-workers are the only thing that made my job bearable. The team leads in my department were no help to anyone, only looking to do things that benefitted them and not the team. My manager was a nothing more than a ""yes"" man. The upper management and VP of my department were all great, friendly and personable people. Onsite cafeteria and gym, work leagues (corn hole, volleyball, bowling) Healthcare was subpar, minimal opportunity for transfers or advancement Come and be a part of the family. This company, it’s benefits, pay and most of all the extra-ordinary people make this a wonderful place to work. If you are looking for a place where your contributions are valued and celebrated, a place where you belong as part of a family, opportunity for advancement and a feeling of achievement then Reynolds and Reynolds has it. I recently had to face the toughest challenge of my life and Reynolds and Reynolds has been there the whole way helping and supporting me with my growth and challenges I face everyday. My work family has cared for me, challenged me, inspired me and been patient with me through my healing. They have grown with me and I feel truly cared for when I come to work. This makes me want to do even more for each of them and myself and has created a culture of giving unsurpassed in my career. I love this company what we do for others is incredible. However, the great lengths we go through for what we do for each other is something I have never encountered as an employee. This culture of all for one becomes the inspiration for accomplishing more than expected and is nurtured by your presence. Temporary job Low wages, unprofessional leadership, little to no guidance from management, lack of respect from management, inaccurate quality assurance audits. Would not recommend this place. 0/10 company Stay away, this company was horrible and terrible. I can't believe they exist, they should be sued and their assets apprehended. Nobody should treat their workers like the way the CEO does. Stepping stone for better opportunities. If you are looking for a job to get you by while you are looking for a career then work for Reynolds and Reynolds. They have made themselves the perfect stepping stone for better opportunities while giving you absolutely no incentive to stay. If you are a hard working, intelligent, motivated, experienced leader you might as well not waist your time with Reynolds and Reynolds. I have seen people come and go from this place for years and the reason is always the same. There is no future here. The goal at Reynolds and Reynolds is to advance the people with the least amount of potential so that the hard workers stay producing product vs. filling one of many unnecessary salaried positions. The only argument they have to keep people is that the place is climate controlled and they will match 6% for your 401K. Well I hate to say it but matching 6% of next to nothing is still next to nothing. Productive and collaborative work environment I enjoy working part time with Reynolds & Reynolds. It is a very productive and collaborative work environment. The supervisors and engaging and understanding. The company is very effective in the way it is managed. It is very efficient and there are a lot of opportunities within the company."
Sabre|" Easy going workplace “You always deliver work ahead of schedule and never forget any details.” ""One of your greatest strengths is your ability to manage multiple responsibilities.” ""This year, you've demonstrated your ability to take on new projects while also meeting your day-to-day goals.” Okay Dirty environment they pay maintenance lower than production. Making small improvements here and there Management is good for maintenance not really anywhere else Good company I loved, I was always treated with respect, I was rotating positions all thectime and every single supervisor I had was totally professional, fair and reachable. Untill now we are keeping in contact time to time. I felt I was home in a family group moving forward with a business Good work life balance Excellent work life balance, flexible work, interesting projects, flexibility to work on things Pay is not competitive, the company is losing top talent, travel industry is volatile Great company to learn the multi faceted world of travel I loved my time at Sabre and was looking forward to growing prior to Co-vid. Growth and development/mentoring is dependent on your manger or take charge yourself. Plenty of people and opportunities for networking along with mentorship program. Love my supervisrs and all of the team I have great supervisors that care.Everyone on our shift work as a team to get production out the door safely and as quickly as we can while producing quality products .Our pay is great and work is not to bad .The hours are hard some weeks though.As a parent it is very hard to balance 12 hour days 5 days a week and home life.It is very hard somedays. Always worried abt layoff twice a year You can expect bulk layoffs twice a year.some Directors P create positions to place their know people and send the people out who really worked for many years. they do bulk hiring and give lot of vacations and by End of year,there is always huge layoffs. Excelente ambiente laboral. Excelente ambiente laboral, con gran posibilidad de ascender en el cargo superior, mediante capacitación profesional en la empresa. Top Máximo Llevar el trabajo en su casa, si uno tiene Flia Interesting projects, friendly people, but many people left due to pandemic and slow but steady decline The projects are interesting, you also have freedom to work on things and learn. Many people left due to the pandemic and financial issues. The company has been losing talent and likely on a decline Good company but could be better Too many alpha male personalities depending on department. Be I left, it was highly enclosed to learn the latest technologies. They allowed time to create proof of concept models and offered rewards. Can learn latest technologies. Flexible hours depending on position. Can involve dealing with difficult clients and travel to places you might not want to go Meh It was ok slow moving, old tech stack slowly changing. The pandemic made it a dangerous place to be. They laid off and aggressively are replacing in India. Remote work Layoffs and moving roles to India Family owned company with lots of opportunity for growth The employees and leadership staff make you feel like part of the team as soon as you come onboard. They train you and let you know what your job purpose is on day #1, to make it safe! Great company, but too many politics in the way Company is great too learn from, benefits are great but pay isn't that amazing. Progress is limited to those that work themselves to death or know people in high places. Benefits Career progress Good benefits The medical, dental, vision, 401k matching to 6% is good. The medical benefits are especially good. The office in Southlake has a gym, cafeteria and Starbucks. Talented group of engineers, architects. Well structured in change management, governance. Industry struggling with revenues due to COVID. Good pay, benefits, bonus, gym, cafeteria Offshoring jobs Hectic environment but lot of opportunities to learn The company was in the process of a culture change to be inclusive of employees from a variety of backgrounds. Continuous learning was encouraged and cooperative environment was being promoted. The management had an open door policy to be receptive to ideas and grievances. No longer recommends Executive Team has no concise direction and employees rarely trust management. There is no loyalty to team members and since 2018 or when the new CEO arrived too many respected executives were let go and replacements have no idea what they are doing. Flex Work There is zero loyalty. Zero. Bad culture for software developers Sabre had a culture that I didn't fit well into. I would be ok with business people telling software people, ""This is the problem we want solved."" and then allow software people to come up with solutions that management would approve. Instead, at Sabre it was like, ""This is the problem we want solved and this is how we want you to solve it."" Signs and their website said, ""Sabre is an Innovative Technology Company ..."". In 2015 at least, Sabre was a very stogy company, IMO. Also, the software I dealt with was really bad. I remember complaining once about global variables and a software lead asked me what is the problem with global variables. I was speechless. How could she not know? That's programming 101. Benefits were ok Bad culture for software developers Great place to work Culture at sabre is awesome. Plenty of opportunities for advancement, and management really values input from employees at all levels. Would definitely recommend Sabre to anyone in the market for new opportunities. Great people and culture Travel industry is being hit hard by COVID the culture is excellent Excellent place to work. Great team spirit at sabre. Work-life is great. Training opportunities are always available. The salary and benefits are also great Strong team culture and working with integrity I was very fortunate to have worked with the people I did over the 40 years. They continue to be the very best and help make Sabre a very strong company today. I consider myself lucky to have learned and grown up with Sabre over those very important years. I will take with me this background and strong friendships and hope to contribute to other companies. Great Benefits If you call Hard Work a con then I guess it is. I am always up for a challenge Good people Enjoyed my time with Sabre. There are many smart people working at Sabre. The engineers have created amazing products. Campus is nice and the work life balance is good. Easy going workplace “You always deliver work ahead of schedule and never forget any details.” ""One of your greatest strengths is your ability to manage multiple responsibilities.” ""This year, you've demonstrated your ability to take on new projects while also meeting your day-to-day goals.” Very unprofessional company with no clear strategy and unimaginative management. This has been the worst company I have worked for. I was threatened repeatedly by my Manager when I was new in my role. My Manager tried to force me to quit and then when she left the company, I was asked repeatedly to stay. There is no collaboration at the company. People ignore your email requests. The company also does not seem to know what it is and where it is going. Terrible culture, sweatshop mentality Cultural fear and job eliminations is the norm Work-life balance They are flexible with working from home and life balance. Job security and advancement Company is constantly eliminating positions, and laying off, even before COVID. Benefits team is inflexible and treats everything in black and white. Example: terminated an associate while they were on their honeymoon, because no vacation time was available. Management High turnover leaving you to have a different supervisor at least several times in one year. Expectations are not clearly defined. And eliminating a position seems like the go-to, rather than setting up their associates for a success. Culture It's a culture of fear, not knowing if you'll be going into work, and getting job eliminated or laid off. Overall Remote work is welcome and encouraged, however, it can lead to your supervisor not talking to you for weeks. rather than invest in people's success, and lay out clearly defined goals and expectations, their problem resolution tactic is simply to eliminate your position. The benefits and employee relations team have an antiquated notion of how to treat human beings, always reverting to the policy rather than being conscientious of the fact that a person is a person and life happens. The pay at this company is good, but you don't feel good working for them. You need to have thick skin You got to love what you do if you want to be around.Never be afraid to express ones self. Of you have a ideal to save the company money and it is well vetted; then please act on it. Closed mouthes don’t get feed. High turnover Pay was average, lots of hours and overtime. The workplace culture was bad due to turnover and having to work every weekend to get caught up. working in very dangerous work environments. Horrible bosses and upper management. overtime late nights How about no It sucks you shouldn’t work here they treat you so badly like no there was no enjoyable days it was dangerous for only being 16 an hour you could die at any given point there’s no safty Great company but resource strapped Really really good people at most levels who have purpose, skills, and the right attitude to accomplish great things. Unfortunately my organization included a leader who was verbally abusive, and did not do a good job of recognizing their people worked 80+ hour weeks for months continuously to keep the company moving forward instead, dismissing massive, painful furloughs (and then layoffs) was “that furlough thing” you can only get so much blood from a stone while being disrespectful about their accomplishments before you drive them away. Little ir improper training for what we experienced after arriving in Bejing. Interpreter was unsupportive and language barriers was difficult. Leadership in the field was spotty mainly because supervisors were in another country, which is not conducive for training and management. Most of the time we trained ourselves in the field. Additionally, the required travel back to stateside every 30 days was exhausting to say the least, and our responses were that it was for company perdiem and overseas staffing. Probabky cost good company takes financially care if its employees remarks in my comments above. Consistent history of layoffs I would have rated the company higher if there wasn't a constant question in my head regarding who will be laid off next. Prior to the COVID19 disaster, Sabre regularly laid off top performers. The only conclusion I can draw from it it that they use layoffs as a budgeting tool; leadership's priority is maximizing shareholder value. Seriously, all the other related reviews are not a coincidence. Sabre stated their intention to prioritize people and culture. What they absolutely do not understand is that when they lay off employees, the ones left are affected as well. OT for hourly employees is only paid after more than 40 hours in the office; if you take a day off, or if there was a holiday, you don't get paid OT until you surpass 48 hours (dishonest IMO). Free lunches, Free dinners, covered parking You will be laid off at some point A lot of turnover from hiring and firing Sabre pays lip service to employee satisfaction. Case in point: they hired an HR manager and one of her first observations was that people are always afraid of layoffs. She renamed the HR department ""The People Team"" and then she was gone soon after that, having been on the job about only a year. Nice building Sabre chews up people and spits them out big layoffs every couple of years the hardest part of the job is little direction from management and no upwards mobility. Best part of the job were my teammates. Personal time off is not up to date with the industry. compensation Top Management often change and there is no strong leader Sabre lacks that vision and more layoffs are still affecting the company reputation . There is no process involved in most of the cases Clearly Sabre lacks Vision Interesting work Good place to work, interesting and rewarding customer focused projects, open and honest management team. At times, work/life balance was a little off but management seems understanding and willing to award comp time. Team oriented. Strong sense of belonging Sabre employees are very team oriented environment. Teams pull together with common mission to deliver for customers. Ability to work in different business units and grow within the company. Sabre encourages you to move around to different areas to learn different parts of the business. Flexible work schedule. As long as your work is done and you are available during core hours, you can set the schedule that works best for you. Flexible work culture Flexible work culture and option to work remotely few days a week as long as you do you do your work. I was lucky to have good manager to be flexible with my work . Relaxed place to work for I was an intern at Sabre. Love the internship program.Loads of fun and lot to learn,also pays very well. Be confident during the interview and follow up . Enjoyable place to work The environment is open and friendly. The people are professional and the work is interesting. Management is employee focused and is interested in continuing education, employee advancement, employee wellness and the community, Culture is great Generally excellent place to work, good workplace culture. Pay is a little under average. Very diverse in workers and management, occasionally to a fault. Enjoyable industry and perks Enjoyable industry to work in and great perks such as international travel. Thecompany outlook not so great especially now in the days of corona virus. Productive work place and built great work relationships I worked under customer service the whole first summer I was an intern then the next summer I helped with paperwork as well as sending our mailing list. My manager taught me many things about how to be resourceful and how to make myself valuable for my next career path. Good hrs Lots of hours no family time. Pushes for work to go out without the right paper work. Does not care about the workers health nor the reason. Had high turn over rate Easy going workplace “You always deliver work ahead of schedule and never forget any details.” ""One of your greatest strengths is your ability to manage multiple responsibilities.” ""This year, you've demonstrated your ability to take on new projects while also meeting your day-to-day goals.” Productive Place to work Work at Sabre is fast paced, busy and enjoyable. Many of the people are great to work with. Lately, there has been an emphasis on hiring younger people and get away from the mentality that this is a travel company. Exciting place to work Exciting place to work. Great technology team. Flexible hours. Generally collaborative. Based in Dallas and travel is very much optional unless you want to meet your teams in other locations. Great coworkers Great coworkers that don't mind answering as many questions as needed. Management does seem to try to make the best decision for the employees when the chips are down Great Company The company is great and the leadership is very supportive.It is a relaxed environment and there are options for individual growth and career development. Okay work place Working at Sabre does not feel like working for a technology company. The tools are very outdated, and there is significant reticence about change. Sabre's Southlake building is an open office for everyone including executives (you decide how you feel about that). Nothing I'm telecommute so.i don't have much to.offer.i regards to office life. Compensation package is competitive. It's a big company with all the baggage that entails. Poor to fair Busy Learning opportunities are good. Many employees are bypassed for advancement. The culture is published but many leaders have not adopted it. Challenges Great people to work with on a daily basis. I worked at Sabre for almost 28 years, got a 'Happy Anniversary' card from the Director / VP on a yearly basis, until I got laid off in 2018. Words had it that it was time to reduce number of older people who made too much money. It was time to outsource my job to Bangalore where it was cheaper and easier to replace whenever they like. A new CEO always came with new strategy, but laying off people was always the first action. Managers and Directors couldn't say 'No' when VP spoke up. Their hands were tied, wouldn't listen our opinions (or they chose not to.) However, the people on the operations were great. They helped each other, even across organizations, no matter how long and how tedious it would take. It happened to me several times and we made it to keep the customer happy. All in all, great place to work and make friends, if you can keep yourself above the radar, or excel yourself to be the management's favorite. Management and Employee work well together I had all kinds of business support and the company really wanted to their employee's to succeed, unfortunately SABRE has closed it's Dallas office and moved the company to Florida. All the employee's in DFW area have been laid off. Unorganized This company is really unorganized. I have been here half a year and feel like nothing ever gets done. I don't recommend it if you are early in your career wanting to learn and get good opportunities. Good company but heading offshore Sabre at one time allowed innovation by allowing questioning of the status quo. Recent upper management stifled the ability to question and with it innovation. Current CEO seems to be opening that door back up but jury is still out.... Great company to work for. Overall great work environment and professional. Very busy work place and all the working tools to complete daily duties provided. Great and professional fellow employees to work with. Great team work and morals. Good company to work for Good company to work for, but they continually have layoffs. The year I started in May 2003, they were walking employees out of the building that they had laid-off. I had never seen this done at any other company I worked for, my first thought was ""what did I get myself into"". All companies have their downfalls, but Sabre overall is a really good company to work for! The Culture is good, and hopefully they have resolved the turnover at the TOP! Sam Gilliland was the BEST CEO that Sabre ever had when I worked there, but those that came after him did not last. I worked in the Research group for the SVP and his team, and I cannot say enough great things about that team, led by Ben Vinod! Great and extremely talented team! Sabre also has the BEST of benefits and Paid time off (PTO). Choose to not respond Management kept saying that their employees are highly valuable but yet they will lay-off a US based employee and hire an offshore person to improve profits. Don’t do it They throw you to the wolves and no support. Even though I had a new hire buddy, they did very little to help me learn systems in place. Everyone is out for themselves. People leaving in droves. Sabre I worked for Travelocity. This review is no longer relevant as Travelocity is out of business. Sabre continues to operate. The facility there in Southlake is an extremely nice building with the best cafeteria I've ever seen for a work location and I've consulted at many places! They have a gym too, it's a little small, not the newest equipment, but it does the trick. Has small locker room. Productive and reputable company to work for Productive and reputable company to work for. Very well organized and structured organization. Publicly traded company with a lot of roadmap investments for future growth. Not a good place to work .mass lay off with no notice. Pay was low. Ever changing schedule. Worked all holidays. I do not recommend sabre as a place to work. Especially the call center. Diversity Poor management Sabre is a great company Sabre offers great stability and great benefits. The management and fellow co workers are really great to work with. I really don't have any complaints. Great Management, Lots of travel Best part of job-great crew to work with.. job security there was always work.. the money was good and the experience was great. I learned so many things and life long tools Easy going workplace “You always deliver work ahead of schedule and never forget any details.” ""One of your greatest strengths is your ability to manage multiple responsibilities.” ""This year, you've demonstrated your ability to take on new projects while also meeting your day-to-day goals.” Great place to work Great place to work and good work life balance. Enjoy working at Sabre. Exposed to new technologies and got opportunity to work with great people and leaders. 1 1 Did not live up to expectations The company misrepresented the position. After starting with the company, the role and management changed. So now, I am in a role that is way to junior. 2 Good job, liked my position and job duties. The hardest part of the job was insecurity of not knowing if you would be laid off or not. I personally went through 3 reduction in force with the company. Encouraged to advance within the company. RIF's The job was hard i made it easy i change all the pulling number and put them all for low to high Easy to get along with a people person love to work straight forward if I don't like it I will let you know that day smile all the time I'm just a happy person Great Company, Great Diversity Great management with wonderful staff. It was great to see such diversity with everyone working effortlessly together. There are many events held on campus with teams competing against each other to add a little fun to the office environment. Large cafeteria Far from Dallas Job Security Low job security and jobs are currently being relocated to other development centers. Love the company and the efforts they are undergoing to re-brand and build. Nice place to work Nice place to work and good team who collaborate with new team members. Cultural diversity, various business units to learn and have an option to move to those BU to learn about the whole company Once great company Once a great company, frequent management changes and a large number of departures of key people have rendered the company unable to compete with Amadeus. Work hard play hard Managing global customers with co-located teams results in varied working hours as you must work within the customer's time zones. Must be flexible enough to keep up with changes. Excellent Managers Managers always available and great communication skills. Always felt my work was appreciated. The culture was great, Sabre is an international corporation, so I was able to interact with co-workers globally. Good work envirnoment Its a good place to work. Its relaxed it gets hot inside those poles i have a cool manager thw schedule ia cool but youndont make enough money more cash would be great cant really live off what they pay 2 lunch breaks Hot. And they dont pay enough Fast Paced great environment Loved being able to work at my own pace through a partner not directly with SABRE. Learned a great deal about the hospitality field. With great people Great place to work I thoroughly enjoyed my career at Sabre, which began as a part of American Airlines! Great advancement opportunities, which I took advantage of, and quadrupled my salary while there. Supportive management and environment, completely open to all ethnicities and lifestyles! Very creative. The ONLY negative thing I will say is, at the level in management that I was, there wasn't an effort made to assist it relocating me within the company when lay-offs loomed. The competition was crazy for the few openings available. I lost out and was laid off after 18 years! Your Mileage May Vary I've been with Sabre for a long time, and I've found that your employee experience really depends on your manager. Every business unit feels like a completely different company and your manager can make or break your experience. The work life balance is good as most managers will allow you to work from home if needed. The facility is nice with a gym and cafeteria as well as fun activities from time to time. The dress code is casual. Productive and fun place to work at I had a great time working as a full time employee at Sabre in India. In the US I was a contractor but I enjoyed equally with the work, people and environment. My project got over and hence I had to leave but I would love to be part of this company again, god willing. Learning opportunities and growth, good benefits Work life balance was a little compromised Very flexible and enjoyable place to work Worked in UI/UX as an intern, and the people here are very nice and helpful when you need it. Hours are pretty flexible and you can often work remote if you need or want to do so. Lots of opportunities for movement within the company from what I've seen and heard from others. Nice offices and an overall good workplace environment. Sabre Corporation Very strong corporate leadership with primary focus on people and culture. Environment is very fast-paced and the business landscape changes constantly. Teams are very collaborative and globally separated so strong communication is paramount to success. Productive and adequately exciting workplace Very nice atmosphere, could stand to pay a little more, but fairly decent job. Lots of opportunities for overtime and advancement if that's what you strive to obtain. I started out training in hand-to-hand self-defence for women. The idea was to provide a low cost training for women in self-defense. Sabre was the right product but the attendance was lacking to make a good business. I took a different coarse but still train in the use of the product. Wonderful colleagues Co-workers at Sabre are fantastic. Work/life balance can be minimal depending on your position. Pay is not top grade. The business operates on a very tight margin which tends to require layoffs about once a year. Easy going workplace “You always deliver work ahead of schedule and never forget any details.” ""One of your greatest strengths is your ability to manage multiple responsibilities.” ""This year, you've demonstrated your ability to take on new projects while also meeting your day-to-day goals.” Ok to work I didnt find strong networking among the staff and among the different projects, but the organization is performing well, making profits and developing itself as well. Worst company to work for If you don’t want a career and you want your job to go India then work for Sabre. They will lie to you all the while preparing your hard work for 1/3 the price in India. Layoffs are every quarter and job security is zero. None Everything that makes a company bad from culture to pay. 5 Fun place to work The work culture was excellent. Teams were very collaborative. Employees allowed to grow within the company. Great benefits. Everything was enjoyable about that company. Unfulfilling and Stressful. The job would've been fine if management pulled their head out of their behind and stopped catering to the incompetent supervisors. Plenty of skilled folks will be looked over in favor of the brown noser. They'll hire anyone. They'll hire anyone....... excelente Muy buen ambiente laboral, horarios flexibles,muy buena infrastuctura, muy buenos beeficios. Struggles to change culture Nearly all projects are date driven, with quality and functionality secondary. Product using outdated technology. Very few people want to do their best and for most it is just a job. Trying to have 80% of development offshore. Very few good leaders. Indecision and CYA mentality. Promotions uneven. Culture is fear-based. Work as development Avoid working on any projects not directly related to your manager. This company moves resources around and then cycles thru layoffs. I hope it has changed since I worked there long ago as they were too slow to change, and too tied to AA. Good training. Scattered management Sabre is Reinventing itself Sabre is trying to pull itself out of the 80's. They are trying but, they still have personal in key positions that do not want change. Sr. level technical staff are not empowered to make decisions. Relaxed Env with good people Slow to make change to new tech Outsourced In effort to maximize profit, Sabre exploited H-1B programs replacing many skilled US employees with temporary H-1B staffing. In addition, they moved their call center to Uraguay in efforts to lower cost, and highly leveraged development teams in Poland and Mombai India. Very unprofessional training Sabre might be a great company, I am not sure, but I have to admit that a great company has a great training. My first day of training was awful. Very unprofessional trainers, they were very amateur, unsecure and a lot of misinformation. Too many misinformed young trainers. Training schedule is a mess. No set breaks, no lunch time. Their pay rate for a person who speaks 3 languages is extremely low. None a lot Fun and productive place to work Always busy and always change....I got to travel to places I would not have otherwise been able to go. Had a great boss and co-workers. I loved my job!!! Sabre A dynamic workplace, in that, many of the Sabre systems and products support many global businesses in the Travel industry be it Land, Air or Sea. The culture has changed by way of a assertive CEO and dynamic executive team who are aligned and in agreement with plans to modernize the technology, processes and people of the enterprise. The most enjoyable part of this job is that Sabre has a group of folks that really want this company to succeed and win at the customer experience. Work is challenging and not mondane Be Ready to produce without limitation to a 40 hour week Great place to work and after work activities. Great place to work. Travel industry has it's up's and down's. Be expectant of rushes in work and down time. They are great with their employees and after work activities. great location near the freeway Managers need traiing Good Benefits, Terrible Work/Life Balance Sabre offers very good benefits, but there is no real effort to ensure employees have a good work/life balance. Another con to work for Sabre is that they have way too many layoffs, so you never know if you're safe. great benefits no work/life balance, too many layoffs. work at sabre Design and develop software services for Merchandising Ancillary Products.

Legrand North America|" Not the best place to work at Managers do do their jobs correctly and always breathing down you’re neck. Most People there are not friendly. Worked as a temp here and the whole time it was a lot of drama and a big waste of time Great Environment A great place to work. Middle management is top tier. A lot of people here are lifers. The work itself can be a little monotonous. Great opportunities for growth in the company, and a generous 401k match. Health care plan needs an overhaul. 1 star What is the best part of working at the company? Coworkers are really friendly and helpful What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Terrible management. This place has favoritism and no appreciation for long time employees and don’t get me started on the raises. No competitive pay here. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Cool coworkers and terrible management What is a typical day like for you at the company? Over worked and no backups when you want a day off Stressful Learned a lot while working there, one good thing is they like to promote from within and develop their people. On the other hand once you’re promoted they don’t replace you. So youre in an environment with a bunch of managers and no workers. Lots of meetings makes it hard to get your actual job done. Very numbers driven organization. If someone leaves they just absorb the responsibilities onto someone else’s s plate Team work Teamwork is NOT dead at this company! Amazing team work mentality as everyone helps each other succeed at their jobs. Help us just a call or text away for those working remote. Everyone logs into a Teams portal where we can post our questions and receive help from any number of others with know-how. Don’t do it Nepotism still runs rampant, if you work there you are an acquisition away from being cut. The growth strategy for Legrand is to buy companies then gut the workforce and cheapen the product. Many other better places to work Free coffee Work life balance, pay, time pff Just a job Not the worst place in the world, but not the best. It's just a job. So go to your spot and don't move and if you need to use the restroom someone will wait around the corner watching. So have fun :) Vending machines Excessive backstabbing Great Great place to work. Learn a lot of things. Do multiple jobs. Pay is okay if you don't have a lot of bills to pay. Lovely people to work around on a daily basis. Not a friendly place to work at most of the people stay to their self and would not talk to you They said that they was not going to work you like a robot but that is exactly what you had to do you have to stand in one spot for 12 hours all day doing the same thing and some people stood around and did nothing for 12 hours all day people talk about you and it was a place that was not a fun job to work they also had very outdated equipment to work with which you had bad parts a lot of the time that made your job hard to do Ok company Ok company but could be waaaay better, only thing that has held them back is management, was literally only 1 good supervisor and couple of good leads. Management n skills Mostly high respectable well Temperature n Teamwork no any discrimination by race respectfully treated with fully trustworthy well management good environment n love Divertido Muy buenas personas amables y tranquilas los jefes súper bien los horarios flexible me gusto trabajar para esa compañía Probably the worst company I ever worked for. Avoid at all costs. For starters, they REQUIRE you to go through a temp agency. There's very few positions in which you could possibly get hired on immediately and this is due to their atrocious turnover rate, which they lie to you about in ""training"". I liked my job at first until I realized how poor the overall management is and how petty quite a few of the people are. Some higher ups won't follow their own safety rules. Supervisors and other ""higher ups"" will breathe down your neck so often it's uncomfortable. Even when there's absolutely no work to do, they want you to be working. Even though the lack of jobs seemed to be due to the companies own lack of coordination. Some positions were worked much harder and set to a higher standard than others. This is a place where there is 100% shift favoritism. It was noted by MANY employees that the 2nd and 3rd shift could basically do no wrong and did no work but the absolute bare minimum, and all the brunt work was dumped onto the 1st shift workers. There were numerous occasions that constant mistakes would have to be corrected by 1st shift workers due to 2nd and 3rd shifts negligence, and it was basically an unspoken rule that you couldn't say anything about those shifts because it was considered ""shift targeting"". Because you are forced to work through a temp agency, they can fire you out of the blue, with no warning, for the most ridiculous reasons. You can end up getting fired purely for doing the same thing as everyone else does daily like chitchatting with other employees and asking for help even if it is part of your actual job. I am honestly Decent work place lacks adequate training and procedures. Doesn’t have proper structure with a high turn over rate Had a great Supevisor for inventory very flexible and knowledgeable but all the other Supevisors really didn’t know what they were doing or how to get the best from their employees. It has a high turn over rate so you will be seeing a lot of people not knowing what their doing because lack of trading. HR is also struggling in a lot of aspects. They had me to doing multiple jobs other than what was assigned while the leads for the most part were pretty terrible more concern with drama that actually getting the job done. I did enjoy my time but self taught myself most of the processes. Great Company I moved to Texas and had to leave the company; otherwise, I would have retired from here. The people are good to work with and management communicates well Coworkers are friendly and treat each other with respect. Vacation time is above average New management, management came from manufacturing backgrounds. Assembly area well organized and operated great because supervisor is original one and is well respected and knows what he’s doing. Fabrication side is run like a manufacturing area. There used to machines making product and do not have a clue the difference between a manufacturing company and a fabrication department. There clue less that it’s skilled individuals that make the products. Fabrication supervisor has no fabrication background got job because he is friends with new department manager. There is a running joke among fab workers that management is more concerned about paperwork than making the actual products. We envision them telling the customers that call and complain there order is very late, and there answer is that we have 3 people getting all the paperwork ready after the 1 person gets done making it. Great place to work, lots of opportunity for advancement. Very much enjoyed working at the Rocky Hill plant prior to its closing. The West Hartford plant was very interesting with a mixture of high technology and classic manufacturing. Lots aid opportunity! A nursery pretending to be a warehouse The job is simple but management throws obstacles in your way where it becomes a hassle. I just want to work but supervisors are on you looking for reasons not to give you that next raise. 400% turnover rate. Stay away from Legrand if you can, there are better companies out there A lot of instabilities among leadership team from the top down. Constant changes and appears to be no stable direction. Not much comfort in knowing you will have a job tomorrow. A lot of staff still working at home and at this point thats unfair and ridiculous. All of the work from home staff all got a big pay raises to stay home while they no longer have to pay for child care and high gas prices. The rest of us staff who have to report to site everyday, got nothing extra to risk our health and well being. No extra raises, no extra bonus...totally unfair to the rest of us. Those of us reporting to the sites we got more repsonsibiity, and more work to make up for everyone else who sits at home for the past 2 years. UNFAIR. Beware cause this company will also make you work extra hours (because of staffing shortages) if you are salaried, and you will never get compensated for it. Negative culture overall, and it keeps getting worse. A lot of people leaving the company for a reason. This company does not care about safety, they claim they do, but they dont. If you have medical condition, they do not care. Decent benefits package, swag, annual bonus, days go by fast cause you are busy Company caters to the work from home staff, management, lack of employee retention and investment, staffing shortages Leadership lacking, to many new employees come and go. beautiful facility to work in and well lighted. Very poor HR department. I assemble electrical product, expert assembly person, management poor always changing schedules and work methods, culture low morale because of marginal leadership, use to enjoy coming to work not now, shift diversity as production goals not equal because back shifts leave many jobs incomplete with very poor quality, Maintenance Manager lazy and passes the buck to unskilled mechanics, production tools and equipment always breaking down, Safety department is all talk and no action, to many near miss accidents. Lean manufacturing concept not working because product flow and schedule changing disruptive. Overtime available and weekend work. Use to be a great company to work for, however, there is no empathy towards the work ethic of employees who care Cut back on bonus even though company is exceeding financial goals, to much employee turnover because of poor hiring vetting and training avoid! If you want to work where your boss respects you and helps you though tough times then apply else where. There is no sense of team work or advancement opportunities in this company. Best not to apply. short breaks Not the best place to work at Managers do do their jobs correctly and always breathing down you’re neck. Most People there are not friendly. Worked as a temp here and the whole time it was a lot of drama and a big waste of time Legrand AV, Who? It's a terrible place as everyone is worried about their jobs. -Typical day: varies based on what you do. -What you learned: Don't stay there too long. -Management: Only care about jobs in MN. -Workplace culture: Cut throat as many worry about corporate and divisional leadership make everyone feel like they will be constantly laid off. -The hardest part of the job is knowing your future. -The most enjoyable part of the job, learning about different industries. I no longer work there. I stayed too long. 2 Okay gig, not recommended for long term career There is no advancement and there’s poor management. great co workers and great teamwork for the most part. lazy people in charge unfortunately. no horrible though Good place Great place. The company is a good place to start working. I enjoyed those I worked with on the floor. My team seemed to get along well, I would recommend to someone looking for work. Poor communication and management thinks they never make mistakes. There is no communication between the shifts and plenty of passing around the blame. They will work you into the ground then host a layoff. In order to go to another department you have to go through the entire interview again. Ping pong table cool until they took it away.. At the time it was ok. The lady was nice she made sure I had what I needed.. Working there was okay until they changed people up in office than thing was going down hill Business heading right direction Great place to work. The team is amazing, knowing what they do and why they are doing. The management team is clear on the general direction and people are friendly to work with. Everybody really works together to get the job done. Everyone is nice and helpful. The job is relatively easy to do and you can get trained to do other positions if you want to learn. Safety is a top priority. They let you know how the company is doing overall every month. They provide free lunch about once a month, Give away great prizes when we have company functions, They are concerned about your wellbeing Good pay for a Technical Support role but... The company has no clear direction. It is a mish-mosh of a ridiculous number of companies that have no real synergy across the brands. My team was part of two brands that were discontinued in the same year. We were promised that there would be enough product to fulfill warranty claims and customer service issues for at least two years. We got less than two weeks. Our days are spent telling each and every customer that there's nothing we can do for you, go buy another company's product to replace ours. Incredible pay No future in my location (Central PA) Good job with decent benefits. Getting into the office from the production floor is difficult due to a lack of open positions. It can be done because that is what I did. The people are friendly as long as you are friendly. People are friendly Loss of production capabilities It's a job. You work in there through a temp service. If your lucky you will get a full paycheck every week. Get it back eventually. Management dumber than a bag of hammers. Unrealistic production numbers they want. Machines are junk. Management does nothing to Utilize knowledge of employees. With 7 years of fork lift experience i put in for material handler. We don't have one at night. Now 4 months later, we still don't have one! Only friends or family members will get a position in here. A 18 year old little girl with family in here,fresh out of High school who knows nothing about nothing was given a job with a radio. Stand around and do nothing all night. Some people in here don't do enough work to justify a pay check. It's a job that pays well. Everything! Used to be a great job until management change over. Over worked under paid and no one knows what their doing anymore. I’ve experienced so much change in the years I’ve been here. I used to love to come now not so much. The company used to be really good to the employees, now we’re all just there to make them money no matter what it cost to our families. They used to promote from within now they hire outside of the company. People they hire have absolutely no skills or knowledge of the job they are doing. They rely on employees who have been there for years to help them do their jobs. Sometimes you won’t get the correct pay for doing a another job in the company that pays more. If you don’t say something they don’t fix it. They have many shifts now so that’s a plus if you can only work weekends 12 hr shifts pay total is for 40 hrs though or Monday through Thursday 10 hrs or Monday through Friday 8 hr shifts but they are still working overtime You get a decent wage, lots of overtime, secured by fences and cameras, mask required, temperature check required Shorts breaks short lunches feels like a prison Productive Decent place. The company is a good place to start working. I enjoyed those I worked with on the floor. My team seemed to get along well, I would recommend to someone looking for work. Productive and great place to learn and grow in your position. LeGrand is great at teaching and growing their employees. Only downfall is having to relocate to move up. The managers care a lot about their employees and their growth. Growth opportunities. Relocating for growth. Just love the job itself what i build and package. No good benefits, no sicktime personal none of that just one week vacation that you have to use for sick time personal time and snowy days. They pay sucks, union sucks, and they will fire you on the spot wether you've been there for yrs are a hard and loyal worker, if you reach that absent % wether you have good cause or not. They will toss you like you were nothing. Only good thing they have is profit sharing and even on that you get cheated out of. None Everything. Not bad, not best I’ve worked at Entire plant needs upgraded, benefits are great, culture is trying to improve from last management team. Small division in large company. Work balance is great No moving Up No matter how hard you work and prove to the higher ups what you can do there is no advancing in this company. They just want pets who listen and do the task they need done. The Moreno Valley location is ran by supervisors that don’t think things through. As well as having favorites for everything, so if you want to get recognized you better brown nose. Flexible schedule Pay, no machines, poor management Welcome to the understaffed sweat box terrible place to work. A lot of work, but VERY UNDERSTAFFED in all departments. production floor is a sweat box and no A/C. management took all of our cold water dispensors out of the warehouse to save money! poor leadership and mismanagement is everywhere. Management has no clue whats going on and the place is ran by a bunch of 30 year olds that dont know a thing. had a lay off in 2020 which I am sure they regret. production doesnt get paid well, you can go work at a company down the street for alot more money and not sweat your butt off all day. best thing I did was quit days go by fast cause its busy, can wear shorts no water on production floor, low pay, hot warehouse, management Garbage is what garbage does With over 11yrs of experience a process technician, I came to work here only to be treated like someone with no experience. Supervisors and management had high demands, yet no experience in the field besides sitting in their offices. They don't understand nor want to understand the actual process from start to finish and expect something to be changed over and ran immediately. There is no structure here, except idiots in the office and puppets. I've done multiple time studies, submitted multiple documents and videos yet no one bats an eye. Sometimes they make you work 12-14 hrs without giving you notice. And its mandatory. Overall experience if you want to grow this isnt the place. Secondly, their benefits are garbage. You're welcome. None Garbage management Not bad Not a bad place to work but they do not value hourly employees. Management gets most of the credit for the work of the hourly employees. They need to be more supportive of hourly employees Experience Growth Flexible hours but poor management The job itself is easy to understand. But they underpay their employees compared to other companies that does the same type of work. The management is just unorganized never on one accord. They are open for flexible hours and they do work with you if you have to be out. Flexible job Poor management and pay Not the best place to work at Managers do do their jobs correctly and always breathing down you’re neck. Most People there are not friendly. Worked as a temp here and the whole time it was a lot of drama and a big waste of time Management may make or break you I've spent time in this company and all I can say is that management is the issue. The people you work around, help out l, and get products created for are wonderful. The pay ia fair for the job I did and had no issues with learning and doing my work. Work can be very demanding as you may work every saturday, so difficult to have an outside life when you spend 6 days a week at your job. The communication between technicians and management is absolutely poor. You can tell them the issues at hand but you can't help them understand it. They dont listen to their people and they dont appreciate them as they should. The potential of being a great company is there but they change management so much its unstable. If you're willing to work for a company for the pay, benefits when hired, and love the work you do, then by all means go for it. When management doesn't understand their people, supervisors who would rather control their people and dictate everything they do than actually be involved with the job around them, and appreciate what we do then they could be a fantastic company to work for. Hope this helps your job hunt. Fair pay, benefits when hired Management, poor communication, lack of appreciation 1 You get What you put forth Constant attendance is a must show up as Scheduled and be productive is not a hard task. Wat you put forth in you'll get back in return. Missing days In first 90 days is no hire on another 90temp . 8hr shifts, overtime 19th century distribution environment Not enough training, lazy supervisors, afraid of management Since Legrand took over they demand crazy production quotas, they have let long-time employees that built the company go and taken away real perks like flex-time only to give free snacks! Many personnel have become lazy and unsatisfied since no one listens. Low-level managers won't really take charge because everyone is afraid to be fired. Losing perks all the time like option of 4-10hr night shift. People doing skilled work at convenience store pay. Free food sometime Insurance isn't great. Too many temps barely trained. If you don't like changes your out!! Not a good place to try and grow Absolutely bad management.. No one cares about you just your production .. place is terrible to work.. Superior always on your back for production.. Can be fired if u don't make it None Terrible Fast paced It's a fast pace environment. Lots of new product development and sustaining projects. Most folks are helpful and supportive, but it can be overwhelming at times. Overall, I enjoyed my time at Legrand. The people, taco trucks, casual attire Lack of processes and never enough time to fix things that are broken. Great opportunities for those early in their career I started with Legrand right out of college and was promoted 3 times over the course of my 8 years there. Very matrixed organization, great leadership and development programs, and lots of travel (depending on your role). Business model is based on acquisition and consolidation, so I imagine it would be less hospitable if you're in manufacturing in a rural location. Parent company is French, so benefits are really fantastic! Great benefits, fantastic maternity leave policy, opportunities for advancement and development programs Middle management is rough, less job security as business units are consolidated They put you in a spot and expect a 1 month tempt worker to train a new worker not a lot of help Very short on staff You get pointed for being 1 min late They make you do any job but don’t want to pay HR sore know how to order food they spend most money on food and not staff Horrible management Horrible place This place is horrible to work for pay isn't good benefits are horrible there is nothing great about it at all your under pay for what they are asking you to do. I would not recommend it to anyone. No pros Healthcare good company numbers-driven environment but good company to work for. Its different for administration as opposed to operations (floor employees), but overall, good Nice work hours that’s it Terrible company, fired me after 2 years , cause of a mask incident, union said they can’t help entry level associates. Terrible management. Avoid!!!! Good hours Hard to move up, Union doesn’t help OK company Too much about doing everything on the book and nothing gets done. If you want a raise it has to go throught your manager, their manager, and everyone above for approval which could only be half a dollar Co workers Bad pay, hard to advance Many changes Not a horrible place to work but changes since being acquired are mostly bad. CEO and CFO even left. Never had layoffs until we became public. New CEO just tells us the bear minimum. Good coworkers, nice building Not much PTO for new hires, poor communication Decent job Good pay for the work. Nice people. Decent amount of physical labor but not too demanding. Scanners are faulty and can get annoying but overall works fine. Good people, good culture Overall, very good place to work. Supportive, customer first oriented culture. People are great, management care about the people working for them for the most part. The different brands are coming together and starting to work better as a single team. For a large company, the AV division is mostly autonomous, though the influence from Legrand Group and finance is starting to take over making it feel much more like a conglomerate and caring more about numbers and metrics over things that matter more. Great people, Positive culture, 401K match is excellent, other benefits are average Becoming more management by metrics type of org, Little to no people development, HR is non-existent. Most areas are not staffed appropriately good management open for suggestions and good work atmosphere sad that this company was part of a bigger company which eventually decided to move to Tijuana, Mexico for cheap labor, good management and friendly atmosphere, good comradery amongst co-workers respectful and understandable management not really a con Supervisors have no problem making sure you stay busy Good place to work as long as there is a person in each spot of the line. When you do 3 or 4 jobs by yourself it gets old. If the demand is high someone will hopefully come from another department to help Excellent place to work and evolve. Productive creative work environment. Daily meeting with creative team to establish daily work load. Quiet space to work yet easy to communicate with colleges. Work would vary by the day depending on deadlines of events. Great working on annual trade show called LightFair. Excellent mentorship None Accountability starts at the top!!! P&S does not value their employees...its a next man up atmosphere. Leadership is completely out of touch with the pulse of the workforce, and most employees are to scared for thier job to oppose and or speak up when issues arrive. Not a good place to work If you're looking for a company where you could learn and grow with the company then this is not the company for you. The management like to play favoritism. There is absolutely no guidance or support from the managers. None extremely micro-managed Work schedule The pay needs to be more they did a survey around the area to what other companies are paying and came back up with the pay range.You actually do a variety of jobs at Legrand Good work schedule Low wage Not the best place to work at Managers do do their jobs correctly and always breathing down you’re neck. Most People there are not friendly. Worked as a temp here and the whole time it was a lot of drama and a big waste of time They screwed me over They informed me that my dismissal was due to force reduction, Covid-19. I was temp, and senior to two other temps there. One had been there the same 6 months as I, and never had a full month of attendance. The other had just started there a couple months before the hiring freeze. I came there with the knowledge, skill, and experience to do this job, and not one other temp there could say that. Customers were glad to get someone with this level of competence on the phone. I saved the company money by effectively proving that what the customer called defective, I was able to isolate the root cause of failure, which was installer error. It WAS a great place to work, and I planned to retire from there. Training on the products is lacklustre. I took a system home and studied it myself. Know the product Great company.. fun and challenging.. management for the department I worked in cared for the sales team. Enjoyed atmosphere..felt appreciated. Would certainly recommend Avoid At All Costs Endless blockades for the employees. Mandatory, unpaid overtime including weekend hours (Saturdays AND Sundays). Leadership cannot execute a change without creating major problems that last for months if not years (SAP, Tijuana factory, C2G integration). Productive and Innovative place to work The management team works together to have a strong team throughout the facility. The team works with associates to help improve their production and advance within the company. Excellent company I was very excited to work there, unfortunately due to the COVID19 situation the company had to have many people laid off. In the short time i was there, I learned a lot, and love the company, the culutre and the fact that it has opportunities to grow within the compny. Dont know how they grade your job performance... But it is off...Can work your tail off and still cant get to the 90% mark they want... Need to take more time with employees.... The system they are using to determine your percentage is off.... You can work harder than the day before.... But still your numbers drop.... For some reason the last week I was there everyone was complaining about their numbers....And a couple of times I had a problem I got it checked and wasn't even working under my name... Great work experience It was a pretty good job. I would love to go back. But im looking into something different. I learned a lot and enjoyed the people I was around on a daily basis. Solid Should pay there employees more for the job's that we do. Honestly it's a great job but the pay rate is the only issue I really have with this company You can make difference Always room for improvement when working for a large corporation. Share holders need to see growth in the investments they have made. It is like the military, make use of the benefits. Hated it I didn’t really like working here poor management skills they made you work in -50 below zero you were outside 24 seven it was just not mine the hours were horrible it is horrible would not go back to this place if it was the only place to work.Supervisors suck, pay sucks, don't appreciate overtime, or finding stuff that is wrong. nothing everything Nice place to work with great hours and overtime Legrand has been a great place of employment during my transition from one industry to another. Coming into the logistics industry was intimidating since I had little to no experience, because of the structured training I received at Legrand it made the transition easier. Good Work and Life Balance Good Place to work. Need to go above and beyond if you want to succeed and get promoted. Getting involved and volunteering in other things then your job description is a plus. Job Light work sit all day working with copper wires putting them into what they called connectors with with wires going into different connectors and using machine to connect then Light work Under pay Good and bad The good about working with legrand is that its a fun environment. You are allowed to talk while still getting work done. The bad about working at Legrand is that they were not good with communicating with supervisors and leads. As they were the ones that had to communicate to the employees and it made a lot of things confusing. But never the less still a good job Confusing direction and strategy It's not clear if Legrand will be able to effectively assimilate its acquisitions over the past decade. The company needs to demonstrate successful growth in one of its key businesses. It started out OK, but... If you're looking for a ""tell all"" of sorts about Legrand, then look no further. Despite all of my prior experience being discredited by the staffing agency (Prologistix) I took a job at entry level with the hopes of advancing. More than a year later I am at Material Handler 3. My wife hired on there as well. Right away we observed how select people get to take it easy, even taking extra breaks while everyone else works like slaves, some to the point of injury. They haven't gone 100 days free of work related injuries since I've been there although their little safety board reports otherwise. I have watched supervisors immediately try to blame the employees who were hurt there. After working there about 90 days a Lead position became available in my respective area. There were several prospects for the position. Myself, having over 2 decades of supervisory experience, 8 of which in a relevant field, a Trainer who had long since paid her dues to the company, an amazing Auditor who knows our systems better than anybody, and last but not least, a Loader from another department. The loader was everyone's buddy so he got the position. LESS THAN A MONTH AFTER HE GOT PROMOTED he had the nerve to become extremely volatile toward my wife, screaming, using profanity, name calling, and he even kept stepping toward her like he was about to get violent. There were at least 5 witnesses including a Supervisor. My wife ended her shift because she didn't feel safe at work and went to Human Resources the next day even though I was prepared to have our attorney meet us at work. Management are not experienced in what they in charge of. In my experience, my career was not challenging or able to grow at this company. The company seems to not value input from its employees. It could be a much better place to work if workers were valued more. Look Elsewhere Hired through a temp agency, over 6 months I never received any opportunity to be hired in full time, despite the amount of work I put in. Little to no appreciation for innovation. Great place to work I start my day with a shift transfer meeting so there is communication between shifts. I learned how to be a team player and a better people person. The management here is good and they treat you fair. The work place culture is good with alot of great people working there. The hardest part of my job is handling the different personalities and sometimes the stress that comes with it but the most enjoyable part of my job is getting an order out on time and when co workers go home happy because they did a great job. Profit sharing, safe working environment. Healthcare. Not the best place to work at Managers do do their jobs correctly and always breathing down you’re neck. Most People there are not friendly. Worked as a temp here and the whole time it was a lot of drama and a big waste of time The titanic, she's sinking... I've been with the company for 11 years this year. I'm still there. Since new management has taken over, everything has gone to the dogs. This new management are all young, fresh out of college, with no real experience yet in the field. But you can't tell them that. Because they have a piece of paper that says they went to college, therefore they are smarter than you, and don't give a care in the world about anything that the older employees who have been there for years, and know how the business works, says. They're driving themselves into the ground under the guise that things are getting better and they're more into teamwork. Yeah right. There's too many bosses and not enough workers. The left hand never knows what the right hand is doing because communication sucks and despite the effort, has never gotten better. When I started, and up until new management took over, I was happy to come into my job. I was happy to be there and perform. I was unbothered by overtime, anything. So happy. Now, I hate everything. I hate my job. I hate the mental anguish and being put down, disrespected, and belittled by the management when i've been doing my job successfully for years. It's not just me. You could cut the tension in this place with a knife. All the employees are on edge all the time because management keeps us this way. It's no longer an enjoyable place to work. If at all possible, i'd avoid this place like the plague. They want you to do more than just what your job entails, because without you doing more than one job, you're valueless to the company. (Yes. I had a It's a job if you don't have one. The management. I feel like if they threw the new management out, things would be so much better and go back to normal. 6 dynamic company There are rapid changes in management. The mother company could make dramatic changes at any time. This presents instability. it will be several years before the direction of the subsidiaries are determined. 1 Great people and environment 1st 2nd and 3rd shifts! Overtime and great benefits! The easiest was operating forklifts and picking/packing! Great environment co-workers and management Great work environment None Productive easy going place to work at, there's always new people to meet. Being that I worked 2nd shift; a typical day at Pass & Seymour LeGrand was coming in a few moment prior to the shift beginning just to have a few moments before work. Then as we would come in the shift before are finishing up the last of their work before the change over to the next. I learned how to do specific paperwork for different stations. The always find a way to incorporate prizes for the workers Short Breaks No answer Great place to work,work with you on job schedule , excellent management overall a wonderful place to work and start you career in the distribution center Legrand is not inclusive to women Culture not welcoming to women/mothers. Single mom? RUN! Some departments and more flexible but really focus on what men think. Women dont get included. Yo aprendi Yo apeendi como utilisar escaners tambien aprendi a trabajar bajo precion, decebolverme en cualquier area y mejore tecnicas para manejar el fork lift fue muy satusfactorio trabajar para legrand Good with its ups and downs Sometimes busy sometimes slow. Manufacturing has its ups and downs and sometimes we would have lots of work and sometimes we wouldn't. It all depends on sales Lack of respect for others and unwilling to work as a team. A typical day at work. I come in at 11:00 pm to 7:00 am. Pull orders and scan product to be packed and shipped. Load products on pallets and drive walkie rider to pull large pallet orders. Scan, Pack and Ship orders all night until the shift is over. I learned how to be more productive by using the process required to do the job. Management changes so much there is no consistency. Stressful when your being micromanaged.Not able to get to know people, Many of them eat lunch in their cars. The work is okay some orders are very heavy and hard to place on the pallets without help. The most enjoyable part is when we get off from work. Poor management Fast paced easy work but the management needs work. They have disrespected employees numerous times and have no leadership skills. The job and duties themselves are easy to adapt and learn but the management is a big con to this company. Too much favoritism Good shift, easy work Fernando Worst place to work Legrand is absolutely the worst place to work. I worked there for two months and regretted every moment. Managers don't care about you. Odi will harass you about everything. Pay was extremely low. Nobody can survive off off $200 a week. Clean bathrooms Low pay, Short breaks ok its a job where as long as you come to work you have a job but you can be a temp up to 2 to 3years before hired in the door there is advancement to move up and you can get overtime in there heavy season Good job. The job had a complete set of benefits and had a confident work culture when I was working there. Everyone did there job and management never overworked us and did respect us. Good managment, solid schedule, good team members. We had periods of low work due to business shortage. Good place to learn and work Legrand was really good to me and gave me ample opportunity to learn and grow in my new career. They were supportive of me going to school and allowed flexibility to do so. The management was very personable. Workplace culture is very laid back and easy-going. No crazy hours expected. Workplace culture was lacking. productive a fun place to work and a learning experience and can be made into a long term thing that will always impact your life the employees are also a blessing to work with Bad experience I worked there 7 months no advancement although I was told I was the best. New people got hire on because they were young girls they’re a nasty booty watchers. Good people a good place to work before mass firings and Relocation Good people and atmosphere. 70% Travel to customer sites to install stations and complete floor plans. Test links. Mass firings and Company relocation. Good People good working atmosphere Job Security Productive place to work attendance must be friendly place I love this company it’s a great place to work n friendly people a lot of opportunities n places to grow at must be able to work flexible shifts n able to work n the snow or rain Great Place Enjoyed working with the team. Most people worked there for more than 15+ years. From my time, I think they have a good work environment. North Carolina was nice and the cost of living was inexpensive. Not Inclusive Stay away from C2G if your an minority Worse experience on the job. If you don't look like the majority you are excluded and talked about. Constantly sick as people insist on coming in with flu, cold, etc. The most enjoyable part was quitting and leaving that place. Management is not helpful and violated my HIPPA rights but calling my doctors office. Stay away ethically wrong The Pay but that's not even worth it. management makes inappropriate remarks, small company everyone knows everyone so their cliquish"
Samsung Electronics|" Very interesting and challenging work. One of the favorite companies I ever worked for. Work was very challenging and very rewarding. We implemented some of the latest technological breakthroughs Samsung does not care about their employees . When I got the job I was promised certain things. I was told we were only working five days a week eight hours a day. That happened for about the first week or so but then things change quickly. We were forced to work seven days a week 10 hours a day without any days off. If we called in our jobs were threatened even though we all work seven days 10 hours a day and we’re always tired. Management started To treated employees bad because they were stressed out. After working seven days from January to April without a day off, I had no choice but to quit. I was physically burned out and Samsung does not care about the well being of their employees 2 1 Counter productive and racist This company employed me a week or two shy of three months because of my race. Once the company received the credit, I was treated like a criminal and fired without explanation. The human resources were also confused as to why I was terminated. It was said I didn't know time zones. H.R confirmed that could not be the reason. The H.R rep cleared out my desk. My performance or qualification was not a factor. 1 1 Great pay and schedule Worked in clean 3-4 days out of the week. Con 12 hour shifts. Management was great. Always was on your side and were able to go to them with any concerns of your well being fun work place Its good for wirk three enjoyed a lot of friendly customers, employees were good nothing to complaint , I dont see anyting to say negative , just good thats all free time LOT Healthcare Good company to start with and get experience. Not a career company Good company to start with and get experience. Not a career company. Poor management. High turnover. Samsung throws people and money at problems instead of focusing on quality upfront. it was ok culture is not very good but good people and good benefit. I didn't feel like I was learning and growing, job was boring and my boss is always busy with meeting so no conversation about my career. Intermediate Cool, high-tech level job that gets your foot in the door with semiconductor industry. However, the culture is definitely Korean culture. Not American Job networking Korean culture, I got sexually in harassed, (I’m a female), and hr did NOTHING about it, even when they had cameras for evidence. Had to get Austin pd involved Productive and very nice people and very clean The job was very good an the people were very nice I worked with.The work area was clean an well organized.My team leader was nice an helpful.The job was good an well paid. Free lunch when u get your production Need longer breaks Great work environment This is a great place to work. There are great people here, and it is a really good place to work. I really enjoy working at this factory and like all my co-workers. Okay Okay job dont stress to much about the role your working in most of it is very straight forward and simple … And pay is low for as many hours you will work just try to do over time as much as you can Productive & fun workplace Decent amount of job. Keeps you busy the entire shift. No career development and way too much politics. It's all about who you know & no employee empowerment. Not bad, not great It’s work. Pay is decent. Not extremely fulfilling, but can get interesting if problems arise that need solving. Overall, it’s a good place to learn new skills, but only certain people would want to make a career out of it. Samsung Culture If you dont fit in they will fit you out. Samsung is always looking for that swag in your attitude. Some managers need a reality check. Micro managered a lot Benefits, Get to play with electronics, Met some awesome people Managers, sometimes schedules changed with no notice to work overtime or days off including some holidays Over-the-top stressful Honestly, I had PTSD from working at SAS for three years. They expect you to do unrelated job tasks, especially in Planning, PR, GA, or HR for executives, from posting bail for DWI to writing teacher recommendations for kids’ schools. You are treated very poorly; an executive once threw silverware from the cafeteria catering to a cubicle space with multiple desks because the wrong silverware was provided to VVIPs. No apologies. In Metal Ops Racism is real Metal OPs is run by a leadership team who makes sure minorities don't succeed there. I changed my job title and schedule numerous times for the company, not once did i get a raise over .15 even though i took on much larger roles within the department. People were allowed to talk to myself and folks that look like me in a very unprofessional manner with no repercussions. Minorities are the lowest paid and most over worked people at samsung austin semiconductor by design.. The work place culture is set to a good old boys tune, that only a few can dance to. the hardest part about working in Metals at SAS , is working in metals at SAS. the most enjoyable part of my career at SAS was telling them I quit on my last day. Stressful. No work life balance As a contractor they want u to work ALL the time. And they give you no eta on full time status no matter how many years you work with them. Management is constantly changing Productive but boring great benefits and obviously great that you're working at a global manufacturer, but WLB can be pretty bad sometimes and its hard to achieve personal goals Ok place to work Best practices aren't. Too many corners cut for productivity. Mostly safe but sometimes not. Management unaware if what key people do. This is the culture. This is about Samsung C&T America The senior executive made constant mistakes just to improve the numbers by sacrificing the future. If you don’t have much experience and need to add a line working at a well known company, it can be a good opportunity. Do not stay longer than 3 years unless you do not advance your career. Health insurance, 401K match, lunch support No future growth Great part time job Loves being an SEC but in my area there was only part time available so there was little opportunity to move up but if you are where there is full time it would be great. Love the management and they really treat you well! Time off available and no point system Not many benefits for part time Very interesting and challenging work. One of the favorite companies I ever worked for. Work was very challenging and very rewarding. We implemented some of the latest technological breakthroughs Salary is good and there are many employ support program. I think Samsung Electronics is great work place than any other company. Through the experience with Samsung, you can feel level up. And many division is Samsung, they are world number 1 grade. You can feels pride as of Samsung employ. And one of Samsung culture, Samsung want to good balance between work and life. Many other company trust Samsung experience and then it is positive point to find job. Every person don't hesitate to say Samsung is grobal company. Free Meal and benifit is great. too much meetings and presentation Not much learning and very mediocre pay Your pay is entirely dependent on your starting salary. All the promotions and hikes are on a percentage basis so if you start with a low salary, dont hesitate to look for a switch. Free Dinner Clueless upper management Samsung had a lot of family events.. We started the day by going to pass down meetings, and getting assignments for the day, you learn diffrent equipment little by little, the culture is not that friendly, mostly management, the hardest part of the job is the long hours, but you get off 3 and 4 days at a time. 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Comrade, Respectful, Professionalism amongst Fellow Co-workers! What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Keep your head on a balanced swivel, Always bring/leave with Your A-Game. Lot of responsibilities to keep up with. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Austin, Samsung has a Cool Steady Flow, just Remember where your at. What is a typical day like for you at the company? Working at Austin Samsung is Similar to a Military Environment…be on time, know your job (responsibilities) maintain Positive attitude…You’ll move far, No Regrets. Good pay and bonuses Good company to work for overall. Good pay and benefits. Flexible schedule. Have the opportunity to work from home if needed. Management is not the best. Nice place to work Good place to work with nice people ok pay, ok, benifits and insurance you get to learn a lot about the industry and their products the bosses are very friendly you have room for advancement they have good vacation time they allow you to do what you need to do wet requested time off None None Well known company The company is interesting with big range of products. The management is very bad. A lot of Korean rules. The local management tries to adapt for these rules which has bad impact on all team members. Interesting projects A lot of mickromanagement Good overall place Good place to work with fair pay and good benefits. Different challenges daily ensure you never get bored. Some management is poor, but many are quite good. Important to find the right place within the company as there are some great positions and some poor positions. Benefits, Pay Work hours Productive and fun It's a very nice place people would like to be for example some time you would even be encouraged by some of your colleagues and they don't owe Free lunch Health care Need to share company success with employees Company profit is increasing handsomely but employee compensation are not at par with market standards. Also scope of work is highly skewed in India offices Free lunches, Free transport and other regular benefits scope of work, compensastion Great Place! -Good Team -Good Management Work from home is a good benefit. Great team and very good managers. Training was hard but once you start working you will get the system quickly. Work From Home Benefits good but hard good job, easy work, good pay, flexible hours bad management, not too bad, low pay, mean customers i just need more words lol. great job and fun if you like Productive workplace Peaceful environment for you, excellent support group, since you are in a call and needs help there’s always people willing to help you to resolve your situation or customers issues Good pay No retirement plan Would not recommend They don't care about work/life balance. They only want to see you in the office, even it means you doing nothing. The Performance Evaluations are a joke. It is based on a bell curve and not actual performance. Only certain people advance and work ethic plays a small role. It is based on who likes who and time served. Great amenities and benefits Great cafe No work/life balance Work harder, not smarter Lack of hiring for new employees Very contractor heavy, no FT opportunities Ok place to work. Samsung was an OK place to work. It's manufacturing so expect it to be busy all of the time and have deadlines/demands to constantly meet. The benefits are by far some of the best I've seen. The pay matches the work you do (Once you're hired on as a full time employee and no longer contractor). There is absolutely no company culture, unless you consider Bro Culture your thing, but in general it was not terrible. Pay, Benefits, Plenty of work. If it the end of the world you are expected to still show up. Please stay away, there are better opportunities out there Workaholic culture to the max, you will be worked to the bone and that’s still not enough. Poor work life balance as you are consumed here. Hard to take breaks with so much to do, it’s exhausting. Even when not at work your mind still things of work or have dreams about work… not a healthy work environment. Agency temporary assignment/Job Security The company has a poor work life balance, fair culture environment and has a high turnover of employees. The companies temporary employees come and go Pay Turnover, poor work life balance, hire temporary Good workplace SOMETIMES Management need to do better but overall good place to work and build a career. Good pay for just starting out and great benefits for your family and spouse wokplace culture is generally good Samsung workplace culture and compensation is good. but bad work and life balance. Management is trying to improve workplace culture good pay work and balance Bad management and toxic culture. Leaders and management are incompetent. nothing to learn. This place is a career grave. Need to use more energy on politics to survive than work skills. Good infrastructure, meals Bad management, incompetent leaders Very interesting and challenging work. One of the favorite companies I ever worked for. Work was very challenging and very rewarding. We implemented some of the latest technological breakthroughs Fast paced and great work environment Great fast paced work environment with very share people. It is challenges and targeted are agressiv3 but you will get encouragement and director from leadership. They'll overload you until you burn out This company could care less about how you feel. They'll overload you little by little. Before long you'll be doing the work of 3 people. And if you ever fall short of that, they'll give you a poor review affecting your raise and or promotion. Worst is they'll hire new people to do less than you and pay them more 3 Not that bad Overall decent place to work. Your typical helpdesk role where you support users. The pay could be better but you shouldn't expect too much for tier 1 role. Almost zero supervision Takes years to become full-time Run fast Too many supervisor that think they are boss. They also show major faver to the people that has been working there and you never know what time your getting off A lot of smart people in a quickly growing industry Nice place to start your career. But here as well there are internal politics and heavy competition. Find place to work but you need to withstand all the korean culture. Good pay, nice benefits No flexible working, Korean minded traditional work culture Good people, good environment Good work environment and culture. Teammates are supportive and the management is transparent. The job is quite interesting! Overall I don't have any concerns. Terrible leadership. Everybody is just trying to keep their job, so they are always trying to throw coworkers under the bus. Worst job ever. Very sad. So excited to start working for such a great company, only to find out that the leadership is in shambles. Was told flat out that it's not going to change to either get used to it or start looking for another job. If you don’t want to grow at all in your career, this is the place for you. If you want to coast life by not doing anything and still get stressed out by the little mistakes, then this company and work culture is for you. High turnover rate in this company is apparent and whoever is left over is thinking to leave to go to a different company or change industries completely. I would not recommend working at this company if you’re on the creative side in the engineering world. Management will make sure of that! Benefits Upper management, no sense of growth, toxic work culture Ok first job Good company but management did not believe in pay increase. Would be a good first job to gain experience. Just don't expect to get paid much. Look around Work schedule Pay Productive and results driven workplace where getting it done is the goal. SAS is a great place to work if you prioritize your work life above all else. The company is doing great things and co-workers and managers are all very capable and supportive. The only thing I didn't like was the work-life balance. Cutting Edge Work-Life Balance The job is easy. The management sucks The easiest job I ever had but managemnt is horrible. From the office all the way down to area leads. Wants you to work area lead roles and get paid production pay. Management tell you one thing. Koreans tell you another. Favoritism at its best! If you not in their ""clicks"" you mos def will be used and underpayed. And if you speak your mind be prepared for someone always trying to get you fired from that day foward Long hours at the office - especially near product launch Loved working at Samsung when all product management was centralized at Richardson, TX location and Product Line Managers were from the USA. But when operations were dispersed to be near our major accounts (eg. AT&T in WA, Sprint in KS, VZW in NJ), it changed Samsung’s corporate structure and culture to have more Korean managers on-site with longer work hours expected. Freedom to work independently (yet collaborate with team members) and spearhead initiatives. Long work days Stay away unless you don’t have an option This place is extremely toxic and obsessed with control. Anything you have in mind will be blocked by management, no time for improvement. Bringing up down tools is the only thing people are concerned about. Good luck with retaining people. A lot of good senior engineers have left recently. Onsite gym and benefits Low pay, stingy compensation, bad software, every decision made by Korean HQ, a breeding-ground for pencil-pushers than real technical people, lots of pointless meetings, need to scan your bag and have stickers on your phones when entering Love working here Very good place to work and the company is very flexible and takes care of employees. Very grateful to be apart of this community as a whole and strive to be better overall OK overall OK, korean culture exists still, not much globalized, care about people and people's needs, try to meet employee's deman, work hard, many korean reports Work hard too much korean report Very Good WFH job This is my first job as a customer service representative, I started in Standard Tech Support working on all Samsung Devices, Watches, Buds, Tablets but after 7 months I got promoted to a Specialty Department called Premier Service which is the BEST they only work with the High-end Devices & there are only 2 which is the Z Flip & Fold soo our call flow is much more controlled it gives us time to provide the best support for our customers. Also I love the almost unlimited overtime they offer it is truly the best job I've had so far, Only Bad part is some customers do not understand we only work with the warranty so there are limitations in our options we have to assist since we can't go against policy they normally get upset the device needs to be serviced first before an exchange is even an option. - Call Flow - Overtime - Employee Discounts - Friendly Staff - Work from home - Entitled Customers Fast paced. Management does not care about employee Fast paced. Management does not care about employee. Micromangagement everywhere. Culture is also not that great. People are always worried about others Users and don’t pay right at-least to other companies of much lesser value Users and don’t pay right at-least to other companies of much lesser value. Plus management style is awful..if they done using you for what they really keep you for, they get rid of you like you mean nothing, no exit package barely nothing Not concern about employees at all. Management needs to be replaced Not organized and always trying to push to achieve their bonuses. Management needs to understand their workers are the keys to make a team. Not just replacing new staff. At time they would give free lunches Not give equal hours among their employees This is a good job for long term career goals would recommend to students and teachers This is a good job for long term career goals would recommend to students and teachers This is a good job for long term career goals. I do construction now but Very interesting and challenging work. One of the favorite companies I ever worked for. Work was very challenging and very rewarding. We implemented some of the latest technological breakthroughs High demand, fast-paced environment to learn alot. Being bilingual makes you more valuable depending on job role/organization. Does not lead to additional benefits compared to addtional work/demand. Expectations are high and you can tell the company is doing its best to keep people in the same position/wage while adding additional job responsibilities Decent Pay, Managers will work with you to Improve, Opportunity to grow long as you try and don't give up High expectations/work load, Racism towards bilingual employees (More work, expecations, verbal harassment) without additional benefits, frquently adds job role while unable to add additional head count to save $$ 2 The good and the bad. What stands out about working at this company? Tips The good and the bad. What stands out about working at this company? Hope is an optimistic state of mind that is based on an expectation of positive outcomes with respect to events and circumstances in one's life or the world at large.[1] As a verb, its definitions include: ""expect with confidence"" and ""to cherish a desire with anticipation.""[2] It is an anticipatory emotion.[3] Great technology extremely poor leadership in North American group Base Salary was good but as a sales professional the Samsung Electronics America (SEA) sales leadership would consistently change comp plan mid quarter/mid year to reduce competition and reduce exceleraters of their top sales people. Most good sales people get into this career field to hit exceleraters. Thats what drives talented sales professionals. SEA would do anything to reduce payments to their top people by moving the goal post and my best guess is probably was NA leadership at SEA (Sales Management) was never in sales so they don't have a clue how to run a sales organization 🤷. Go figure..sales leadership never in sales, so they spend 99% of the time talking internally and no time engaging customers or other industry leaders. The short term Bottom line ""$"" the most important thing even if it's at the expense of the customer experience (Very sad- and will cost the organization their reputation and future growth). On average 30-50% of the time reporting that takes away from facetime with customers (excessive reporting- less time selling). Their were some positives. SEA does have great technology and great benefits. If SEA would change leadership to focus on the customer and take care of the talent the sky is the limit for this organization, but honestly I don't see that happening based on past experience and current leadership (many of us waited and waited for change, but change never happened which was mind boggling. Last few years huge turnover, especially with most talented people due to poor leadership. This tends to kill moral and has become a real problem as top Benefits and Cutting edge technology Poor customer focus, poor management Terrible, treated like dirt and dumped when I was no longer needed If you're contact based don't expect to be treated well. I was frequently berated, under paid, over worked and moved around to different best buys all the time. great discount on Samsung product, onsite parking is provided. work place culture depends on your team. my team was great but I heard other teams can be very stressful most of senior level positions only open for Korean. staff benefit limited headcount for perm position Bad Work life balance Work/life balance is so bad. But benefit is reasonable. Work in clean room. There are many rules. So it is bad environment for me to improve myself. Production worker Samsung is one of the jobs that makes you quit first day stepping in . To the point where you first get to the parking lot, that’s already stressful and messes up your whole day. Also hate that there’s a lot of people and small break room area and have no time to take a break Easy job Parking, A lot of people, small break room, large building that take up your break just walking to break room, the people and management Great opportunities and pay, work/life balance is the trade off Great pay and advancement opportunities. The trade off is the work/life balance. I have worked for two different departments, and noticed similar culture. Always on call. Great Pay, advancement opportunities Work/Life Balance It is a lot of favoritism at this facility I feel that Samsung needs to be more diverse,and also staff need to be more aware of things that are going on. The culture in this facility has to change it’s one sided. Underpaid Total joke Culture, workload, management the worst I've seen yet in my career. Constant firedrills, 12+ hour days, no support from team to help succeed, general concensus amongst honest peers is that this place is a total nightmare Pay is ok Terrible leadership, no training, no processes Chaotic workplace, but with a huge impact on flagship devices This is the flagship R&D lab of Samsung Electronics America. For wireless communications, this is a very innovative lab with a huge impact on Samsung's world-renowned flagship devices. They have some of the smartest researchers in the industry, and it is an absolute pleasure to work with most of them. BUT, all of this comes at the cost of chaos (on a day-to-day basis), increased emphasis on commercialization support, and understaffing. 1. Day-to-day chaos: Patents are a huge part of the yearly evaluation, and publications are highly encouraged (one of the few labs in the industry that does this). But, a single person is often assigned to multiple projects, due to chronic under-staffing. So, the fast-paced nature of the projects, and weekly meetings with HQ in South Korea means that you must balance a bunch of conflicting requirements: (a) keep up with HQ's unpredictable requests, (b) find time to write patent documents (probably the biggest metric of your productivity, when it comes to pay raise and promotions), and (c) do (a) and (b) for multiple projects. Further, due the flip-flopping of HQ's technical members (as a result of the tension with their management), some projects get canned overnight, new use-cases appear out of thin air, often with very short turn-around times to report on feasibility. THIS IS A RECIPE FOR BURNOUT. 2. Increased emphasis on commercialization support: Commercializing an idea is a beast. Over the last 2-3 years, the lab's emphasis has shifted towards commercialization support, and away from research. This often results in employees having to compromise Very good compensation and benefits, subsidized meals for employees, culture of collaboration, very smart group of people. Chaotic day-to-day worklife, overemphasis on commercialization support, and understaffing. Not a good place to work The salary is excellent, but the working culture is so terrible. The managers have a lack of knowledge, and they don’t listen to employees. There is no career advancement as well as unfairness and favoritism. Good pay and great benefit The company has bad culture and unfairness and favoritism. Way too much middle management. Too many supervisors adding no value or support to technicians on the floor. Quick to disipline for minor mistakes while ignoring the efforts and significantly more successes. Moral is very low. Equipment Engineers have no work/life balance and are expected to be on-call 24/7. Gratitude is expressed by giving employees a free cupcake at lunch. Insulting. Diversity of the employees is plus. Samsung gives back more to the community then it does to most of its employees. Good health benfits Too many to list Decent Foot Forward My department is very relaxed and supportive, however, contractors do not receive proper benefits. But overall, the company is a great starting point. Inexpensive lunch, supportive management, relaxed environment No PTO Need more communication There needs to be more communication from the upper management. A lot of decisions made by them are left unclarified. They have a lot of contract employees that have a high turnover rate. A great place to learn and gain skills and grow as a Full Time Employee. Contractors are not provided with benefits, very limited PTOs and is not clear if you will ever be a full time Employee Well paid but too much process well organized and paid too much process is killing people by stress and waste time too many people lack of worker at sites Too sensitive directors well known/ well paid / name value too much process Stay where you’re at No room for advancement, poor management, culture shock. They hire people from outside before hiring within. Jobs are awarded before posting All Easy jobs Culture The company was the best work place I’ve worked ever Samsung was my first work place I worked here over 12years. They are focus innovation a lot so many people develop and improve manual things. Their work style is very systemically . And they gave me training perfectly. Some manager super used super strong over roll good and gave 5 stars Benefit, super smart work style Overtime, strong responsibilities Good technology, good compensation Samsung has some great technology and great movement around to different positions. Workplace politics plays a role but it is fun to work in the fab with all the great tech compensation, benefits, people workplace politics, too many cooks in the kitchen Bad Do not train well . you are going to get threw to the wolves and be told to learn how to survive it is not for the weak or faint of heart. I am leaving after 5 years Very interesting and challenging work. One of the favorite companies I ever worked for. Work was very challenging and very rewarding. We implemented some of the latest technological breakthroughs Implant Managers are bad at their job. The SAS culture there as a whole is horrible. But the Implant Managers play a lot of politics and never like to be questioned. They will look over converting people they feel do not align to their culture, which is a culture of expectations of kissing their ring like they are royalty. Compressed schedule Implant Management 2 Great place to learn terrible place to grow Compensation and total benefits package were overall lower than my expectations but decent for Austin; however this is changing and Samsung is not changing fast enough. Turnover is quite high so expect to take over a lot of work when you're just starting out. Management is selected solely by tenure and not by ability to manage a team. While my leaders have been brilliant technically, they have not been very supportive. Your milage may vary depending on team. The best part of the job so far has been being able to work from home during the pandemic —I am lucky to have been placed in a department very open to that— but, again, YMMV. Easy job with decent pay. Dont mess up and youll glide by. Bad leadership at all levels. Your satisfaction will highly depend on your team. 3 Good for job security but bad management On my first day of being hired, my job was immediately switched from what I initiated got reviewed for. This switch wouldn't be able to get fixed until I had a year of experience. During my time working, I experienced several issues with upper management making us do more work for less results with the response of there's nothing we can do. With the long hours included I would come back to my home in pain due to how much they worked up. They also upped their pay during my time there but that didn't give me any bonuses because of that staying exactly where I was. I wouldn't recommend working there unless you have prior engineering experience to use as leverage. Otherwise they'll work you dry until you can't continue and they get rid of you. Nice clean location, secure job Bad Management, Painful Labor Beware of Information Security Team I have learned that the cybersecurity management for the facility has a huge ego. The CISO has been there for 20 years and has not idea about security technology. Samsung has proprietary systems which do not play well with mainstream technology. They are a security breach waiting to happen. Free lunch Management Just ok Long hours, no life, incompetent management, indefinite overtime. Good place to work for people with no family or those who have no life & like to be overwhelmed with work. Fast moving culture, Supportive management, Not work-life balance I look for Marketing function. The job is very dynamic and has a lot of things to do and learn. Team is friendly, inclusive and supportive. Good package and bonus. Good Package, Bonus, Healthcare, Flexibility Lack of work-life balance, Very fast-moving This is a huge company - your experience may vary Overall, I experienced Samsung as a good company: great colleagues, standard to maybe slightly above average benefits, exciting products/launches. They do try very hard during onboarding to help employees acclimate to the culture and learn the company history (though in the US, Korean culture will obviously be a huge influence since HQ is in Seoul). Seems mgmt is very driven by metrics, want visible results. Bonuses are paid quarterly and extended to teams outside of sales. In my experience, WFH time was worse than normal office time. 80++ hour weeks (if you are getting great pay working 2x as much, make sure you are getting compensated appropriately). Working weekends expected. Late evenings. Completely unsustainable unless you have no obligations outside the company. In my division, only men and childless women are in positions of leadership (true even well before the pandemic). high separation between levels, asking questions to management is not handled smoothly. They hire tons of temp workers and keep them indefinitely and with a high level of responsibility (but not mobility) in a way that seems very exploitative. Benefits, bonus, resume builder, its a huge company with many good people Working expectations are excessive in terms of hours/days, exploitative hiring practices, not family friendly Good work and good people I was have working before the Samsung company in Austin Texas and I was making good money but right now I'm not working with them because I'm work on different business thinks I'm just giving my face about the Samsung company and north of Austin Texas it's a great company and they have a great benefit and I'm encouraging everybody to go find work or to apply for Samsung company Ok place Great place to work if you have management.thats the only way . Facts nothing but hassle. Terrible hours. Never great hours at all.show the world truth. Free food Management Awful management Stuck doing repetitive work even if you're eager to learn and do more they will restrict you to what they want you to do. Management is 0 help in pretty much any situation. compressed work week low pay, long hours, bad leadership Great benefit and pay for early careers Career advancement is pretty slow. however you learn things and get to work with great people. Salary is wea on software engineering, as they are treated same as other equipment engineers. But fast growth and great company over all. Great job, very easy and stress free if youre used to working the field and building relationships. Opportunity for advancement is slim to none as an FSM. It is difficult ult to move up and forsomeone expecting growth itt is hardly there. Over all the pay is good and easy enough if you can build steady relationships and speak to people and build rapport. New tech, manage yourself, control your days No upward movement Awful Lots of favoritism and lots of laziness. Too many young kids don’t want to do they job it’s really not about they workers it’s about the people that work their. Management and line leaders are terrible. They take pictures of you if you “not doing your Work” and whenever theirs a problem they don’t fix it I can go on and on but yeah I wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone!!! Hours are extreeeemmmlyyy long it’s supposed to be a 12 hour shift 4:30-2:40 but instead we work over to 4:40 the latest! We even stayed to 5 :40 once. I only been here for going on 2 months and I hate it WOULD NOT RECOMEND mind you the people that work their are VERY MESSY Pay Bad management and work environment friendly people place can be mundane after years of working in this position, great working environment and friendly people, good salary and pretty stable if working for Korean VPs. cheap good quality lunches contractors get less benefits Good place to gain experience Interesting Korean culture with chances to advance if you are high performer and dedicated to learn and flexible for new assignments. This is a large company that gives you a good perspective of how business can be developed opening markets for a new brand. Productive fun place to work at It was a blessing the managers and supervisor even the people that work there was all teamwork I would recommend anyone to go and work for the company the salary good the hours good so is the overtime is good so come on get to the health care Good Healthcare hours the supvisor all are great Ok place to work. Not a bad place to work at. At least in my department. I work overnights so it's less stressed than working during normal business hours. I also get to work from home since my department is considered a specialities department. Work from home Pay could be higher Good Place to work There are lots of great benefits working for a tech giant. Samsung is always pushing for the next best thing. Samsung is Definitely worth pursuing a career. benefits, occasionall travel, best tech Company can be to big at times. Fair Pay/ Toxic Culture Fair pay compared with other companies these days. big company, good to put on resume. cross-function, everyone does their own part. Data driving, doing a lot of reports. However, sometimes people work late due to all kinds of reasons. your work-life balance is unsecured. It really depends on your manager or your team. However, company culture is toxic... sometimes managers are overpowered Fair pay Long hours, no work life balance Sinking ship Lot of bureaucracy to deal with for day to day mundane work. Also, most product development and strategic decisions are owned by R&D team in Korea, which leaves little room for growth US employees. Exposure to innovative products no room for employee growth"
Teladoc Health|" Very well-organized, inclusive and excellent management and coworkers Very well-organized, inclusive and excellent management and coworkers. Help Desk and Provider Relations have been very supportive. Clear and well-organized policies and guidelines. Pay rate is very competitive. Good flexibility in my scheduling. 3 1 Therapist I enjoy working with my clients. I have flexibility in my schedule, and this position offers great work/life balance. An increase in compensation would be helpful. Also, there is very limited support, if you need assistance. 1 Nothing Nothing good to say about that company at all. The management is weird. The training is for the birds and they lie to you about what’s happening on an daily basis. I wouldn’t recommend this place at all. 1 Ok place Expect a lot from their nurses difficult to have work life balance. Frequently changing processes. Expected to work extra hours without compensation. Can be chaotic Release structure can be chaotic and deadlines are dictated from the top-down instead of getting input from those working on it first. Can make it tough to stay motivated. Z-pack factory If you want to focus on customer satisfaction rather than actually practicing medicine, this is the place for you. You can prescribe all the zpacks you want. You'll probably get a wag of the finger, but nothing will come of it so long as you keep the customers happy and coming back. Nothing Zpack dispensary Love the benefits & mission I love the benefits of the company, I think they're very fair. The mission is phenomenal. I don't love my role and despite applying for (and being qualified) other roles within the organization nothing has happened. The ability to grow within the company would be apprecited. Lack of respect for physicians, work is fulfilling and interesting The leadership team does not respect or value physicians. It does not feel like a welcoming or supportive work environment. There is more emphasis on cost reduction than on providing the appropriate or indicated services to members. Reducing expenses is valued over caring for members. Physicians are not supported by leadership, and physician input is not welcome. Really enjoy working with the members and providing expert medical second opinions. Meaningful work that makes a difference in peoples' lives. Great benefits, easy job Great benefits, easy job, lots of available overtime. Lots of micromanagement. Management watches you like a hawk. Strict schedule and management won't miss an opportunity to write you up. Cool workplace Now its all remote. Very vibrant team and cool technologies. Lots to learn. Supportive managers and management. Compassionate people all over. You can settle down and look for long term employment here. Very ethical company as well. They don’t cut corners to pleae the stock market or do window dressing. On the contrary, they provide very conservative forecasts. Good learning atmosphere. Flexibility but low volume Great flexibility to set your own hours, but the volume is often not enough to make it worth it. The documentation is simple and straightforward, but does involve an excess amount of clicking. Would be a good company if no for devices not working for members The day consists of answering call after call regarding devices not working properly. Mostly network issues. Some of the calls are for ordering supplies. Wfh, equipment provided, PTO accumulation is decent Short lunch, back to back calls no time allotted in between for documentation, difficult to get assistance from supervisor when needed Easy shifts and Access 24/7 I'm satisfied but not too impressed. Some glitches in the software slow you down. Trouble connecting to patients due to incorrect phone number too often. None, except you can start/end anytime Pay is mediocre Don't work here Run. The stress is not worth the pay. It's always over amount of calls. It's draining. No one knows what their doing. Leadership is the blind leading the blind. Do yourself a favor and run far from any applications about this place, those that are in are busy trying to break out. We're not appreciated, respected and we're overstressed and understaffed. Great Flexibility and Balance Working at Teladoc provides a level of flexibility and balance I never thought I would in the corporate world. It's very refreshing - and so is the unlimited flex time for exempt employees. Terrible Management Management in the department I had worked in was awful. Very draining, discouraging, stressing and unprofessional. The Manager I was working with was very demanding with very little leadership skills. Also, working with the ""higher ups"" in this company you will soon see no one takes accountability and wants the lower level associates to take care of the issues. Flexibility with schedule No sense of leadership 3 stars What is the best part of working at the company? The best part of the company is working/speaking to the members What is the most stressful part about working at the company? The QA process which focuses more on redundancies rather than the actual completion of the job being done correctly. Livongo Diabetes Expert Coach Great job, repetitive work which can get exhausting. Compensation was $28 an hour. Difficult time getting time off especially in the summer. Great benefits, wonderful management was never micromanaged. 5 stars What is the best part of working at the company? The best part of working for Teladoc is the balance of work and home life. That coupled with opportunities to advance, make it an ideal work environment. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? With any job comes stress, but I have to say I don’t feel stressed at my job. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Very rich, diverse and inclusive. No growth opportunity, bad management Zero growth opportunity. Don’t even bother applying for internal positions, they will put you through many rounds of interviews spanning over a course of several months only to tell you that you were not chosen. Management is clueless and unsupportive. The work is repetitive, tedious, and overwhelming because management will not hire new employees yet constantly take on new projects. Be prepared to do your entry-level work and manager’s work simultaneously. It was a much better/healthier environment when it was Best Doctors and not a million different companies haphazardly merged together. Old school corporate I do not recommend working here for millennials. Hard to advance professionally, too manager mid level managers not engaged in their own teams and just riding out until retirement. Drastic change coming from Livongo to Teladoc Health. Very well-organized, inclusive and excellent management and coworkers Very well-organized, inclusive and excellent management and coworkers. Help Desk and Provider Relations have been very supportive. Clear and well-organized policies and guidelines. Pay rate is very competitive. Good flexibility in my scheduling. 3 1 4 stars What is the best part of working at the company? Flexibility and control of my schedule. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Lack of support. 1 Great benefits -- bout it. Listen. When you get there you are painted a picture of great benefits and a positive environment. Only one is true and I took full advantage of the free Healthcare. You are put into a position where you don't have the tools to do what you need to do. If you need information from another department-- good luck. No one wants to help or they will help just enough to put you off their plate. ""Yea yea go talk to that guy in this department."" You will hear this for days if not weeks... and in the meantime you are getting pummeled with other tasks and duties that are a ""priority"". Then you get chastised for not getting to them lol you can't win. Good luck. Ride that benefit train as long as possible. I hope you have a better experience. 2 Limited client caseload I’ve been disappointed with the amount of clients received despite having available calendars. The pay rate is fair $50/session but the charting can be cumbersome and not reimbursed separately Good pay $50/session Lack of caseload Redundant and underpaid, Livongo We are overworked to the point where many of my colleagues are unable to spend time with our own families. The culture is 'cult-esque', which is very similar to the faux elitist and facade of a sorority. We are underpaid and are currently in the process of finding new opportunities. Great training and good pay I have still a newer employee, but so far I am happy with the training I received to prepare me for my job. The call volume is on the lower end compared to other call center jobs and my co-workers are really great at helping each other out. Great company overall Great benefits and culture. No complaints here, apart from the lack of gratitude shown to experienced reps that have longevity with the company. (paying new/incoming reps a higher base) Remote and Flexible! This job was a life saver for me when I decided I wanted to stay remote after the pandemic to travel. I have full autonomy of my schedule and can work as much or as little as I want. The pay is fair but wish it were a bit higher. The platform is not the most dynamic but there are problems with all platforms. I love that I have access to psych referrals and crisis should I need it. Fantastic for supplemental pay or working full time. No benefits or health care which is a bummer but manageable. flexible, autonomy pay and platform Remote opportunities and good benefits Company overall is great, can be hard to move up in your department, but it does depend on your department. They listen to their employees and try to do better. Benefits, Work from Home Good benefits, decent pay, work/life balance needs improvement You have a set schedule and there are quarterly shift bids if you need a change. Benefits are great, you get to use their services plus Better Help free of charge. There's almost always overtime available, but with that means you're almost always on call if the need arises. Working remotely is a huge plus. High no-show rate (40-50%!), no reimbursement for no-shows, LOW PAY and no support - High NO-SHOW/late cancellation rate. Think very carefully before deciding to work for Teladoc as a psychotherapist. The no-show/late cancellation rate is super high (about 40-50%!) and Teladoc does everything not to reimburse the therapists for them. Last month, I had 38 scheduled sessions and 14 were no shows. Teladoc refused to reimburse for the 14 no-shows stating that I did not meet the minimum of 25 completed sessions to qualify for no show reimbursements! I literally wasted 14 hours of my precious time. - LOW PAY compared to industry average - NO provider support. It is a struggle to get any kind of support from the providers support team. I had to email the support team repeatedly for two months before they helped me to updated my home address. - lack of respect for providers. Teladoc doesn't value or respect the providers and takes advantage of them to protect their own interests. The patient services team actually coaches patients to reschedule last minute to avoid paying no-show/late cancel fees without any regard for the providers' lost time. Good platform and support Nice platform,45 minute sessions, no pay for no shows, only 50 per 45 minute sessions. The platform is good and help one organize. Client can be high quality. Easy format to use as soap notes. 45 minute sessions Only 50 dollars for 45 minute session9 I’m finally home! I started as a temp in April 2021 and became permanent in July. Within the months of working here I’ve seen the company grow so much. This is the first job ever where I feel heard and as a pharm tech that speaks volumes since we’re mostly considered bottom of the barrel in a clinical setting. Management is always encouraging growth. We work remotely but the leadership teams presence is felt. Such an amazing work culture happy to be a part of it. Remote work, great work culture decent pay Pay increase based on metrics Productive/Manager It is a high value call center especially with covid came. However it was great because you received overtime. Management and supervisor change constantly, where you wouldn't know who will be your supervisor within a month Good working environment. Good pay Management cup changing position. Some are not loyal to their employees Work Without Pay Teladoc makes its independent contractors complete over 15 hours of training without pay or they can't work. This is not ethical or a way to save money as a company. If they are this cheap with their employees I can only imagine how cheap they are with their clients. Therapist Position I've been working with teladoc for about 2 years. A lot of cancellations, no ability to hold your clients accountable to prevent no shows, support is scarce. However, it is nice to add some diversity to my private practice with clients throughout the state. Always referrals available, scheduling flexibility Many client no-shows without comp, difficulty communicating with cilents between sessions if needed, low pay, low transparency Happy with my experience here I've been working as a therapist for Teladoc for a little over a year now. Overall, I am pretty satisfied. I have total control over when & how often I work. And I have never had to worry about getting enough clients. My schedule is ALWAYS full! I enjoy getting to work with client from all over the state, not just people in my city. There is NO micromanaging. They pay on time, every 2 weeks. Flexible schedule, paid every 2 weeks, NO micromanagement! Pay could be better. Support is sometimes limited. Flexibility has been great Love my clients and have a full caseload, however there is little to no additional support re: technical issues, customer service questions, case consultation etc Flexibility is the largest benefit. The company has great flexibility in scheduling. As a mental health therapist it's not a good job 50 percent or more cancellations for scheduled sessions no compensation for missed session. Not a place you will stay at longer then you need too. The pay is not nearly enough to perform the duties of a therapist. Need Improvement in Payroll Tax Worst job ever. Laid off while traveling to bury my parent. Phone call on the day of the funeral with no regards to or consideration of humanity. Work a lot of senseless hours because two Analysts are allowed to make undermined decisions. Employees are treated unfairly and degrading by Analyst. Biggest challenge is number of errors on checks and no accountability. Can’t keep anyone in Payroll Tax department because of lack of training and Analyst passing their work to everyone. Hire talented and knowledgeable employees for Payroll Tax and HRIS so employees checks are accurate. Great flexibility and well established guidelines make this a fun but relatively low paying 1099 position Pay per patient is below industry standard. But Teladoc limits the type of problems and prescriptions prescribed (no controlled scripts) to make consults easier. The EHR is user friendly but consults are plagued by technical difficulties. I nonetheless enjoy the job as a 1099 employee on “General Medical” the platform for episodic care because it is strangely liberating being forbidden to do follow up. PCP burnout I guess. Easy quick acute care. Set your own schedule Low pay, Very large international company so is impersonal, I communicate through my recruiter, Technical problems. Very well-organized, inclusive and excellent management and coworkers Very well-organized, inclusive and excellent management and coworkers. Help Desk and Provider Relations have been very supportive. Clear and well-organized policies and guidelines. Pay rate is very competitive. Good flexibility in my scheduling. 3 1 A good place to work A very busy and large company making a difference. I was privileged to work here during the pandemic. They care about the well-being of their employees. They also want to get the best out of their employees so expect to work hard. Management could use some work, but what company doesn't? The pro's outweigh the cons here, and I highly recommend working for TeladocHealth. good pay and benefits - respectful work environment - friendly atmosphere - growth long days 1 2 Flexible schedule and opportunities to work as much or as little as you would like. Just wish the hourly pay was higher and that they had something in their contract for providers to receive full reimbursement for sessions that are canceled or missed within 24 hours. 14 2 Terrible experience glad I left and never looked I rather be a retail pharmacy technician than work for this company. On the flip side their benefits are good and pay is on Market. The manager and supervisor was terrible. Honestly I been a tech for almost 10 years and this job is one I wished I never worked for. Breaks and lunches was the only safe haven. Benefits The management Great Telehealth Opportunity Pros: The caseload is flexible. Therapists can reduce/add to their caseload as needed. The flexibility in scheduling enhances work-life balance. The EHR is easy to use. Cons: The credentialing process was lengthy(time to approval). Pay could be better. Good Job It’s a good job. I have no complaints so far. My only issue is the training. They spent too much time on things that we would rarely see in the position. Other than that good job. Great place to work & grow Love being a part of the Teladoc family. This company has a passion for revolutionizing Telemedicine and how & where members can receive medical treatment Teams work hard & together None Great Flexibility, No Incentives The TelaDoc platform is excellent; I love the scheduling system that the clients and therapists use to book sessions. I think the clients are appropriate for the podium, and if assistance is required, there is a care team and other resources to help the therapist and client. I do believe the pay could be slightly better or at the least offered additional benefits. However, compared to similar platforms, it's not bad. The caseload ebbs and flow, but that's to be expected. However, my caseload on the forum isn't as high want. I average 6-8 clients a week. And there is a drought in the summer. But I think two factors contribute to this; my schedule (I'm part-time, no evenings or weekends) and my niche (it works well for me because several are in college or are managing a diagnose I work with often). So I think what's your average in private practice may be similar on this platform. So if you need to supplement, this will be helpful. Flexible; User Friendly Platform No Insensitives Bad management/easy job Management was very rude and unprofessional. The job was easy. Uncomfortable job setting. Seating was horrible. The culture was a negative environment. Starting pay was good, good hours, overtine was, when weather was bad able to work from home available Short breaks, bad management, horrible culture Great pay - miserable culture Pay was really great but quickly realized why. If it weren’t for the compensation I don’t know why anyone would work here. Leadership does not act in alignment with what they communicate and there is no real sense of purpose. Too many meetings full of people talking over each other and no accountability for management. Terrible experience. Positive is it makes me really appreciate my current organization. Compensation Culture/management Great place to work! Great company! Flexible schedule and remote work. If you are looking for a part-time career with a varied schedule that you control, this is for you! I love it! Everyone is SUPER respectful and compassionate towards each other. I work remotely and they recognize that everyone has a life outside of work. Even though we are remote, I feel connected to my coworkers, and I feel fulfilled with the work that we do. You can create your own schedule / flexibility The flexibility in scheduling is great . The compensation could be higher . Working with different demographics is a plus . Great for a part time job. Flexibility Low compensation Close to private practice I’m in control of my schedule, There truly are enough people looking for therapy during business hours and I was able to stop working nights and weekends. Considering that I got about $60 for a session from the insurances I had contracts with and that Teladoc pays $50, there is less overhead than a private practice. The downside is that providers are really kept in the dark about problems with the website, which can be very glitchy for video sessions. You are a cog in their machine and they make sure you know it. Reaching a human being for help with something is almost impossible. The website has barely been tweaked for mental health purposes, so you have a lot of questions to ask during the first session. Ethics according to the company are different from ethics of mental health professions. Work from home, make your own schedule, steady flow of clients Mechanical website, mechanical service, ethics of company and mental health professions do not align Poor Management/No Room To Grow I worked here for almost 3 years and in the beginning since customer service was all new to me it was exciting and fun to learn something new. I was told eventually you can move up to different departments after working for 6 months and good stats. I graduated within 6 months of working and was NEVER able to grow within company for I.T. position. There was no help at all from anyone to help me grow within this company. They pay was average and have a bonus you could get quarterly but they make it impossible for you to reap the rewards. It has a good vision but poor management sadly. Feels stagnant working at this place...no room for advancement. Flexible, Vto, . Pay, Management, No Room For Growth. Used to be great Teladoc used to have a strong mental health department. I occasionally would reach out to the clinical director and felt as if he cared. Recently things have gone downhill. Management is not clear. They compensate way too low. They allow people to no show and cancel as often as they want. They are starting a fifteen dollar reimbursement for a providers time, but that’s wY too low especially with no incentive for a patient to keep sessions. I’ve had people schedule intakes with over twenty canceled sessions and no kept sessions. In order for a company to provide great patient care they have to care about the providers mental health and ability to make a living. I think this is why I get stories of providers who have talked about their own life with their patients more than focus on the patient Flexible schedule Low pay, don’t care about providers, management is not clear or reachable TOXIC enviroment, many no shows/cancellations & client complaints, frequent questioning by Teladoc about your work as a clinician low pay for the work we need to do as a therapist and very demanding expectations. Many clients have anger problems and are disrespectful towards clinicians and fabricate complaints. Constant emails from the Teladoc's quality assurance team questioning your work. Very toxic work environment. I would avoid this place and work with one of the other major tele-health companies that pay better at least. flexible hours low pay, toxic management, disrespect towards clinicians by both clients and Teladoc teams I wouldn’t recommend Management is awful. You only get paid 1 time a month and it’s always late. So if your bills are due, don’t hold your breath for on time payment. Also pay could be way better for the work you do. Hour lunch Pay, management, communication Productive and fun workplace Teladoc is the best. They value their employees. Pay their employees above the average. And help us to succeed. Mostly everyone is friendly. Bonuses every 90 days. Friendly people, management is awesome, always something fun to do during lunch When it’s BUSY, It’s busy!!!!!!!!! It’s not for the weak. The back to back calls that is during busy season. Pay for online therapy is too low, not competitve and pays nothing for no shows I enjoy the work and the clients but they have fallen behind the market on compensation for mental health sessions. $50 for a session is too low and they pay nothing for a no show. Many other telehealth companies pay $70/session and most pay at least 50% for a no show. I believe Teladoc is counting on inertia of therapists as they built a large group of therapists early but now there are many more companies which pay better. Also Teladoc is too focused on medical in their training. All the examples are about medical diagnosis and case notes. You have to figure out a lot for yourself for mental health. A few months ago, if you had a question support was nonexistent. You could email a question and never get a response. Now you will get a response within a few days which isn't great but better. Flexible work hours Poor pay and support Great Company with so much opportunity for growth I love what I do and who I work with. The company really promotes staying and growing within it. I understand the company mission and what to do to align my job expectations to succeed in it. Very well-organized, inclusive and excellent management and coworkers Very well-organized, inclusive and excellent management and coworkers. Help Desk and Provider Relations have been very supportive. Clear and well-organized policies and guidelines. Pay rate is very competitive. Good flexibility in my scheduling. 3 1 Good Place to Work Teladoc was an amazing place to work and I really enjoyed it. Everything was organized and great bonuses. The managers are great and are there to hellp you. Benefits Nothing 4 Pay is okay, no micromanaging but also no support I wish they'd pay more per hour than they do but it's okay at $55/hour. Other companies pay $75/hour for the same work. There's no contact from anyone you work with so it's hard to say if you're on the right track at all. SOAP notes are a bit cumbersome as they require a lot of information and they need to be fast tracked more. flexibility pay 1 2 Great work place Enjoy working for this company , very great experience for my first time working for a call center , mangers make sure have all the tools needed to assist the members Able to still work my primary job and have a second income Great support and motivated clients My recruiter stands by me.. I don't like the SOAP notes though. Used to more sophisticated systems where my note focuses on the process, not repeating material I would have cited once in a bio. flexible hours soap notes Very supportive team you work with I love it but there is a lot to learn, you need to pass certification before you begin working. They consistently improving, I make my own schedule when I want to work. Amazing support team. Only downside is since there’s a lot to learn, they need to pay more. Team support, make your own schedule Need to pay more Fun place at times to work I was getting picked on by a specific supervisor and it was really uncomfortable. Other than that...It was a good place to work and was able to get shifts i wanted. Shift changes are done every 6 months. pay and bonuses shift bids Great contractor position Excellent pay for a contractor position. Steady stream of clients and flexible hours (whatever works for you). Keep in mind that at Teladoc, patients choose you, so they’re aren’t “referrals” per say. They will offer suggestions to help you with your bio to appeal to more clients if needed. Independent workplace, no meetings or interaction with colleagues. Pay, flexible No team environment, self referred clients Good pay, easy job This is as a great job for me while living in Texas. They adjusted quickly when faced with COVID. We were able to work from home during which was awesome seeing we didn’t have to stress about losing income. Increased on holidays Director not a team player flexible schedule but poor compensation and no tech or clinical support The only pro of working as a therapist at Teladoc is the scheduling flexibility. Other than that, it is quite frustrating to work here. The pay per session is low especially given the fact that they expect you to conduct 60 mins sessions. No compensation for late cancellations and no shows and there are MANY cancellations and no shows. Many clients that need higher level of care and are not appropriate for telehealth. Onboarding was hectic, the support team for therapists is unresponsive and very difficult to reach. Not a supportive work environment. Lack of communication and organization. flexible hours low pay per session, sessoins are 60 mins long, MANY cancellations and no shows and no compensation for cancellations/no shows, no tech or clinicalsupport Its a decent job with good pay. It's not the best job I've ever worked at, but it's not the worst. It's a simple job with decent pay. There is nothing to stress about. Management will unnecessarily stress you at times but that's what happens when you promote senority over skills. A bunch of people with no people skills trying to manage others. If they took the time too revamp some of the Management it would be an excellent job. Opportunities, competitive salary Short breaks, some management Changes need to be made for ""call center"" type jobs You get verbally abused by ""members"" that call in. Some members are very nice so this is not applicable to everyone. Supervisors are not very knowledgeable and remind you that ""after all you do work in a call center."" This type of work is easy, but the job itself can build you down. As an expert in customer service this line of work is not for me. When I started working there, I did think I would work there forever, I was very hopeful and enthused but then you dread the types of calls that come in. This job gave me mild anxiety. Compensation is good: $20/hour as the starting rate. But aside from this, not so much. You have to experience this type of work to know if it's for you or not. Stipend for Internet, Remote work from home, Starting salary Adhearance, Surveys, Schedules, Supervisors, Monotonous Well Run True to form. What you see is what you get. Efficient. They pay per 30 minute interval but it takes longer than 30 minutes to give effective nutrition care. not bad Teladoc is a high-tech, high growth digital healthcare company with a passion for caring for people. You’ll discover smart teams to work collaboratively. working from home U until to recently, this job had great flexibility. I could work when I wanted, anytime I wanted and for how long I wanted. The company recently changed its scheduling model to a shift scheduling system that is not transparent and offers less flexibility. The IT platform works very well and charting is easy. Monthly quality updates are helpful. Good patient triage, physician friendly patient flow without pressure or backlog. Short wait times for patients Lack of communication from management about new scheduling system Management is no good Management literally sucks. And there is no room for mistakes, they will literally fire you if you mess up even if you have good work ethics oh but they will keep every one else who absolutely sucks at their job and do the bare minimum. NOT A GOOD HOME FOR A THERAPIST- Training/Tech issueS, no tech help OR consistent assistance I am not sure $50 per session is a reasonable professional wage for a fully licensed clinician with years of experience. I think it should be based on licensing, experience and type of diverse experience. Have not been working long with this company and I already learned from other staff how hard it is to get assistance of any kind in a timely manner. I am starting to think these online companies are just big business mentality. With all the money from each session the insurance pays, that should be paying for exemplary administrative assistance. I figured I would try this as a side job. I know what it is like to be in private practice, so I know what can be made per hour. I am not impressed. I also don't like that it is a medical model for clinicians and who is really in charge. I think therapists need to be working for therapists not MCOs and this is exactly probably what this company is like. I am just a newbie and already picking this up. Oh and stay away from Thriveworks. That is worse. A complete joke and insult to the therapist profession. Flexibility and hours you want to work Salary same for all therapists, 1099, No pto, Company this big should offer option of w-2 & pto after giving more hours per week, Long unnecessary training, Tech issues with no admin/tech help, One hand doesn't know what the other hand is doing, Poor overall organization and management, Not good onboarding support, Not good clinical support Ok work place Great place to work with a very very flexible schedule. The training is pretty long though so be prepared to sit in a chair all day. Training is not paid but you get a bonus at the end Flexibility Training time Ok and average I find the job to be repetitive at times, but it is a steady paycheck. I am virtual and can set my own hours. I will stick with the job until something else comes along Excellent for side gig I didn't have to sign on to any shift and just log on when I have time to make some calls. That's the plus because it's so flexible. I was a 1099 employee and filed my own taxes. It's easy and the company is very supportive of doctors and provides clear guidelines, and will back the doctors up in NOT providing antibiotics or steroids. In fact they monitor how much antibiotics and steroids you prescribe for upper respiratory symptoms and let you know if you are prescribing above average, which is frowned upon. During COVID pandemic they provided clear protocol for doctors to follow and that makes it easy. The downside is you get paid per call ($23 per phone call and $28 per video call when I was there) and it gets tiring talking to so many patients during busy season. During the summer (in non-pandemic time) there is almost no work because most calls are related to respiratory symptoms which are mostly in the winter. Highly flexible and clear guidelines Piecemeal compensation and repetitive Overall it's not a bad job. I like the flexible hours and I like the work I do. A typical day consists of answering phone calls from members/patients who are wanting a virtual visit with a doctor or dealing with issues, problems or complaints from the members. It's a moderately paced job that offers a lot of flexibility. The pay is okay for part time work that isn't that hard but it can be frustrating sometimes. The frustration for me is dealing with the specialists or supervisors. You deal with multiple specialists and they are not all created equally. Some are knowledge and easy to work with and others are not knowledgeable and some are on ego trips. I have had instances where I've reached out to a specialist with a question and received a condescending response or felt like I was being chastised like a child. There are a lot of rules, procedures and policies, frankly, too many and it can be frustrating trying to satisfy the member/customer and adhere to all the policies. I understand the need for structure and consistency sometimes you are so focused on the rules you can't really focus on the member/patient issues. They need more condensed resources so that agents don't spend so much time looking for accurate information. They need more common sense policies that allow agents to do their jobs accurately rather than ""dinging"" an employee because they didn't adhere to doing it ""by the book"". Overall I really like the job but I don't know if I can deal with some of these folks and their egos and all these illogical policies. flexibility too many policies that defy common sense and limits use of better judgment Very well-organized, inclusive and excellent management and coworkers Very well-organized, inclusive and excellent management and coworkers. Help Desk and Provider Relations have been very supportive. Clear and well-organized policies and guidelines. Pay rate is very competitive. Good flexibility in my scheduling. 3 1 Stay away from this toxic company! Horrible company, you will end up with a mental breakdown while working for Teladoc. Unrealistic quality reviews, they do not care at all about employees or customers. All they care is about you getting that money from the patients by forcing you to schedule unneeded virtual visits to people so they can charge the insurances. You will have to be a robot by being 100% perfect and reading tons of paragraphs scripts on each call. They are understaffed as people keep quitting or taking PTO every day. Customers are rude and supervisors provide no support at all, you will be scolded daily and monitored live every single day and you get in trouble for the most bizarre reasons such as not saying the persons name 3 times in less than 1 minute call, etc. Simply this job will destroy you until you hate life. After some time working for the company, I just took the decision to leave this horrible place of work and move to a place where they care about employees unlike Teladoc health which only cares about taking money from old folks. Work at home Everything 14 2 Teladoc should pay more for the position I enjoy working for teladoc however I feel that we sold Bee paid more in regards to what all we do. No opportunity for advancement or pay increase. That’s what I would like to see. Enjoy scheduling my own hours The Adobe rooms are always resetting 3 Bad experience Teladoc Health is not the best place to work at if you've got integrity. Upper management gets tons of stock options and those at the bottom barely get peanuts. Promotions are not merit based - 2 senior leaders at the call center have been romantically involved for years... Luncheons, CEO has vision Management is horrible. Supervisors are the worse and everything is made up as they go Management is horrible. Supervisors are the worse and everything is made up as they go. been working from home and if the internet goes out for any reason they count that against you as if we asked for COVID-19 and to be forced to work from home. We are told to get better internet, well add an additional amount in the checks until we could go back in office to compensate. 3 times and your out for internet issues is sad. Management is horrible. Supervisors are the worse and everything is made up as they go Don't Do It Teladoc platform is not set up to support therapy services. You don't have contact with the clients between sessions, if client's don't confirm the appointment in time Teladoc cancels the appointment, and client's often cancel day of/don't show up and they don't have a cancellation policy. In addition, if you reach out for support, they won't get back to you for 2-3 days. If I was to do it over again, I would have not moved forward with working there. Make your own schedule, can get a lot of client's quickly, see as many clients as you want (I average between 30-35 clients in a week). No healthcare, 1099 employee, No informed consent, no intake documents, not set up for long term care, no information on the client before accepting the appointment. Innovative, Fast Paced environment Working at Teladoc you must be open to change. The healthcare industry is ever evolving thus so is the company. If you enjoy a fast paced environment, with work that has a purpose then Teladoc would be a great fit! With a diverse group of employees servicing a very diverse group of clients Teladoc fosters a very welcoming environment and culture in the workplace. Their benefits are great, definitely one of the better benefit packages I found when seeking a new career! Plus there is plenty of room for growth and advancement within the company. access to telehealth services, competitive benefits package, flexible working arrangements, great work life balance Great inclusive place to work Love working for Teladoc Health Work life balance is fantastic There are so many opportunities to learn and grow My only constructive criticism is that the company is growing rapidly and has the tendency to be reactive rather than proactive Work life balance Needs to be more proactive Change your company, Teladoc seeks to exploit its doctors I have been working at TELADOC for over five years and made the decision to leave this year due to a variety of reasons. I am writing this to increase awareness for other physicians who are considering telemedicine as a way to supplement their income. TELADOC has managed to singlehandedly ruin my career and they have been in the practice of doing this to other physicians as well , from reviewing all the documentation I have seen. i worked as a contractor, as do most physicians, here. in fact, as far as i can tell, everyone here IS a contractor. this company is somehow strapped together with everyone working remotely. that becomes challenging when there are technical issues with their online interface, which have been increasing over the past two years. good luck anyone to help with that. all my communication to their support staff have been ignored. i have had consults hung up in the middle , scripts that never went through, difficulty with connecting on the video was common theme the actual patient population is incredibly demanding and have very unrealistic expectations. patients have repeatedly called for chest pain and sudden loss of vision. others wanted me to order durable medical equipment or fill out disability paperwork. and if they don't get what they want, they leave the doctor a bad review, which TELADOC also holds against the doctor. the majority of the patients seek antibiotics for variations of the common cold. even if you are trying to a be a good doctor, you get pushed to give the 'customer' what they want. thats right folks, patients are customers now. how zero vindictive adminstrative staff, lack of collegiality/professionalism, poor IT interface, poor compensation/high risk liability for physician Supportive Team I'm fairly new to the company, however most of the staff that I've met here have shared where they began and where they are now. They have moved up in the company within a short time. This proves to me, I can move up and be successful in this company and that's important to me. Great Place to work and retire Teladoc Health is an evolving leader in the virtual telemedicine division. It's compensation and benefits cannot be matched with any company I've ever worked for. There are countless opportunities for growth and upper management opportunities. They are willing to help you succeed in becoming a leader because great leaders lead and make new leaders. Management teams are collaborative and they help you focus on your goals, attendance, and quality. As long as you show up to work and give your best you will do fine. Teladoc offers many incentive programs and health benefits. They truly believe in diversity and cultural differences. Bilingual opportunities are available. I really enjoyed working here and I would not be happier outside of my new career. I am only leaving due to a professional career opportunity and they have my deepest sympathies. You will not be dismayed when you apply and work for Teladoc Health. The opportunities are endless and its a great place to retire. As a new hire I did receive a free lunch, during holidays there were luncheons, and a lot of team work and team building No cons I love my job This has by far been the best job of my life. Teladoc has provided the best of everything a person could ask for on a job. My supervisor is the greatest and would not change them for the world. They make sure your compensated for all that you do as an employee. The company who believed my potential Cowerkers are friendly and passionate. I've learned a lot since I started working at Teladoc. Competitive salary. Although the workload is pretty heavy, It is possible to achieve. But I wish internal communications with different teams can be better than now. Competitive salary, Friendly co-workers, and great working environment Healthcare, Internal communications Friendly, Respectful Culture with great benefits I work with clients and look into technical issues and new set ups. I am involved in research and collaborating with internal and external client managers to achieve end results. The company culture is very respectful, and very impressive leadership engagement. great stock, can work from home, flexible with family, great pay, great paid time off volume stay out if this company the worst company. Very toxic. The management does not care about employees well-being. Extremely abusive. They treat people with no respect. No career development none people are so manipulative snd abusive. By far the worst company i ever worked for No direction or support This place is the least desirable place to work. You feel the tension whether in office or remote. No one talks to each other for fear of being ostracized by management. Leadership are Amateurs at best. Micromanagement, zero risk management, condescending emails daily. Poor communication, preferential treatment Wouldn't recommend... Work home balance Micromanagement, no diversity, hostile environment. Overall... this place sucks!!! They make rules up as they go. Management & supervisors are HORRIBLE. For the amount of headaches you get it’s not worth the $17.00 the free services are nice and worked perfect for me every time. Supervisors need more training on how to be a supervisor. They talk about how they want you to grow & become a leader but pick & choose people they like. Good benefits. When at the call center we sat way to close & your out in the open. Had to deal with A LOT OF NASTY AGENTS!!! For example, coughing not covering mouth, digging in nose with finger... I mean, I think you get it. Overall this was one of the worst call centers I’ve worked for. This is more of a first timers call center... fresh in the call center world & just want to get your toes wet. They have a lot of work to do to improve. They say they want feedback but really don’t & want everyone to feel included but, yet the town hall meetings where only for people with morning shifts and the rest of us just could not participate. Amazing internship experience Teladoc was filled with extremely supportive mentors and a great culture. My projects were meaningful and challenging, and I learned a TON. I would recommend this internship to anyone. management management is rude and cruel to work with..Awful treatment. some supervisors follow the lead and mistreat their employees as they want to look good in her eyes. They make you hate your job. A horrible experience. They do not value the employees...They will create reason to not pay your bonuses. BEWARE .Teladoc will build you up...just to tear you down. Resigning is the best decision I ever made. Unpredictable management, send conflicting messages The best thing about this company is the flexibility. Sign out to see patients as you please . The support staff is also decent. Everything else is not so good. They pay embarassingly low rates and try to squeeze the max they can out of you while expecting you to be a concierge physician. At the time time they keep stating how you need to improve your performance, without giving any clear direction. Many of their patients are very very demanding are their exxpectations are ridiculous. Ex. Calling with complaint of chest pain and being upset when they are a 70 yo male with htm, dm2, hld, previous MI when I tell them they need to go to the ER. Management is also ridiculous and condenscending with their expectations. All of these ""administrators"" who email you their opinion of your management..sorry i thought i graduated residency 10 years ago."
